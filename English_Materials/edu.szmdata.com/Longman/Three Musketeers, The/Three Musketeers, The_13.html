<p class="chapter">CHAPTER ELEVEN</p>

<p class="storyTitle">D'ARTAGNAN MAKES A MOMENTOUS DECISION</p>

<p>It was too late for Athos and D'Artagnan to put their swords away. They had been seen and it was clear what they were doing.</p>

<p>"Halloo," cried Jussac, advancing with his men. "I see that you are duelling. It seems that you have forgotten the law."</p>

<p>"You are not very considerate," said Athos. He was very angry, because Jussac was one of the Guards who had made the cowardly attack on the Musketeers the day before. "If I were to see you fighting I should make no effort to interfere. Leave us alone and go about your business."</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," said Jussac, feeling sure of himself, "I cannot allow the law to be broken even by Musketeers. Sheathe your swords and follow us." </p>

<p>The Musketeers made no move.</p>

<p>"There are five of them," murmured Athos. " We are only three and we shall be overcome again. For my part I will never again appear before the captain as a beaten man."</p>

<p>Athos, Porthos, and Aramis drew close together. Jussac formed his men into a line ready to charge if necessary.</p>

<p>D'Artagnan made his decision on the spot. It was one of those events which decide the life of a man. To him it was a choice between the King and the Cardinal. Turning towards Athos and his friends, he said, "Gentlemen, please allow me to correct you. You said that you were only three, but it seems to me that we are four."</p>

<p>"You are not one of us," said Porthos.</p>

<p>"At heart I am a Musketeer," replied D'Artagnan, bowing low. "I may not have the uniform, but I have the spirit."</p>

<p>"Withdraw, young man," shouted Jussac. He had guessed D'Artagnan's intention by his gesture and the expression on his face. "Withdraw at once. We allow you to withdraw. Save yourself and go quickly."</p>

<p>D'Artagnan did not move.</p>

<p>"We should be only three, one of whom is wounded, with the addition of a boy," continued Athos. "Yet, it would be said that we were four men."</p>

<p>D'Artagnan understood their doubts concerning him. "Try me, gentlemen," said he, "and I assure you that I will not leave a conquered man."</p>

<p>"You are a brave fellow. What is your name?" asked Athos.</p>

<p>"D'Artagnan, sir."</p>

<p>"Well then, Porthos, Aramis, and D'Artagnan, let us resist," cried Athos.</p>

<p>"Come, gentlemen, have you decided what you are going to do?" shouted Jussac angrily.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Aramis, lifting his hat with one hand and drawing his sword with the other. "We are about to have the honour of attacking you."</p>

<p>"Ah! So you resist, do you?" cried Jussac.</p>

<p>The five Guardsmen rushed furiously at the three Musketeers and D'Artagnan.</p>

<p>The fight was fast and furious for the short time it lasted, but D'Artagnan quickly discovered that he was a match for any of the Guardsmen. Before long one Guardsman lay dead and three others were so severely wounded that they could no longer keep up the fight. The remaining Guardsman, seeing that he would soon be alone against four, broke his sword across his knee to avoid having to surrender it.</p>

<p>Bravery is always respected even in the enemy. The Musketeers saluted the remaining Guardsman with their swords and returned them to their sheaths. D'Artagnan did the same. Then, assisted by the Guardsman, they carried the wounded men to the door of the monastery and rang the bell.</p>

<p>Carrying away four swords out of five, the victorious four made their way with light hearts to M. de Tréville's headquarters. They sang as they walked arm in arm, and occupied the whole of the street. Every Musketeer they met joined them, until in the end it became a triumphal march. D'Artagnan was filled with joy as he marched proudly between Athos and Porthos.</p>

<p>M. de Tréville scolded the three Musketeers in public. In private, however, he congratulated them on their swift and complete revenge on the Cardinal's Guards.</p>

<p>As a result of his fearless conduct, D'Artagnan was admitted immediately to a company of the King's Guards for training under the command of M. des Essart. Thus, under more favourable circumstances than he could ever have imagined, the young Gascon found himself on the way to becoming a Musketeer. Moreover, he was now the accepted companion of the three inseparables, Athos, Porthos, and Aramis, with whom he spent most of his time.</p>
