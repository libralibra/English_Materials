<p class="chapter">CHAPTER TEN</p>

<p class="storyTitle">TWELVE O'CLOCK BEHIND THE LUXEMBOURG</p>

<p>Not knowing anybody in Paris, D'Artagnan went to his appointment with Athos unaccompanied by a second.</p>

<p>The young Gascon, as we now know, was not an ordinary man. So, while telling himself that he would most certainly be killed, he did not make up his mind to die quietly as one less courageous might have done. Recalling his father's advice, "Accept criticism from no one except the King and the Cardinal," he ran, rather than walked, towards the monastery behind the Luxembourg.</p>

<p>When he arrived in sight of the meeting-place it was twelve o'clock. Athos had been waiting then five minutes seated on a fallen tree-trunk, as he was still suffering from his wound. Seeing D'Artagnan, he rose and went politely a few steps to meet him. D'Artagnan took off his hat and bowed low.</p>

<p>"Sir," said Athos, "I engaged two of my friends as seconds, but, contrary to their custom, and my great surprise, they have not come yet."</p>

<p>"On my part, sir," said D'Artagnan, "I have none. As yet I know nobody in Paris, apart from M. de Tréville, to whom I was recommended by my father."</p>

<p>"With your permission we will wait for these gentlemen," said Athos. "I have plenty of time and it would be more correct. Ah! Here is one of them, I believe."</p>

<p>In fact the gigantic figure of Porthos had appeared. </p>

<p>"What!" cried D'Artagnan. "Is your first friend M. Porthos?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Does that trouble you?"</p>

<p>"By no means."</p>

<p>"And here is the other."</p>

<p>D'Artagnan turned in the direction pointed to by Athos, and saw Aramis.</p>

<p>"What!" cried he, in still greater astonishment. " Is your second friend M. Aramis?"</p>

<p>"Certainly! We are never seen one without the others. Do you not know that we are known as the Three Inseparables among the Musketeers, by the Guards, at court, and in the city?"</p>

<p>"Upon my word," replied D'Artagnan, "you are well named."</p>

<p>In the meantime Porthos had reached them. He waved his hand to Athos and then, turning towards D'Artagnan, stood quite astonished. He had changed his showy shoulder-strap and had left his beautiful cloak at home.</p>

<p>"Ah!" said he. "What does this mean?"</p>

<p>"This is the gentleman with whom I am going to fight," said Athos.</p>

<p>"Why, it is with him I also am going to fight!" said Porthos.</p>

<p>"But not before one o'clock," said D'Artagnan.</p>

<p>"And I, too, am going to fight with this gentleman," said Aramis, who had just reached the party.</p>

<p>"But not until two o'clock," said D'Artagnan with the same calmness.</p>

<p>"What are you going to fight about, Athos?" said Aramis.</p>

<p>"Upon my word, I don't very well know. He hurt my shoulder. And you, Porthos?"</p>

<p>"I am going to fight—because I am going to fight," said Porthos, turning red in the face.</p>

<p>Athos, whose keen eyes lost nothing, noticed a faint smile on the young Gascon's face as D'Artagnan replied instead, "We had a short discussion on dress."</p>

<p>"And you, Aramis?"</p>

<p>"Oh, we disagreed over a question of religion," replied Aramis, making a sign to D'Artagnan to keep secret the real cause of the duel.</p>

<p>"Now that you are all here, gentlemen," said D'Artagnan, "please allow me to offer you my apologies."</p>

<p>At the word "apologies" a cloud passed over Athos's brow, a scornful smile showed on Porthos's face, and Aramis clearly showed his disapproval.</p>

<p>"You do not understand me, gentlemen," said D'Artagnan, throwing up his head proudly. "I asked to be excused in case I should not be able to fight all three of you."</p>

<p>At these words, with the bravest possible air, D'Artagnan drew his sword.</p>

<p>"It is very hot," said Athos, drawing his sword, " and yet I cannot take off my doublet. I have just felt my wound bleed again and I should not like to annoy this gentleman with the sight of blood which he has not drawn himself."</p>

<p>"I will therefore fight in my doublet like you," said D'Artagnan.</p>

<p>"Come, come! Enough of these compliments," cried Porthos. "Please remember that we are waiting for our turns."</p>

<p>"Speak for yourself," interrupted Aramis. "I think that what they say is well said and worthy of two gentlemen."</p>

<p>Hardly had the two swords clashed when a party of the Cardinal's Guards, in the charge of M. de Jussac, appeared round the corner of the monastery wall.</p>

<p>"The Cardinal's Guards," cried Aramis and Porthos at the same instant. "Sheathe your swords quickly."</p>
