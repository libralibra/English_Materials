<p class="chapter">CHAPTER 17</p>

<p class="storyTitle">Mr. Bedford in Infinite Space</p>

<p>I was alone in empty space. A violent feeling of fear seized me. I seemed to be borne upward into an enormous darkness, My fingers floated off the studs, I hung in space, and at last very softly and gently I came against the bundle and the golden chain and the crowbars that had drifted to the middle of the sphere.</p>

<p>At the touch of the bundle I felt as if I had awakened from a dreamless sleep. I immediately realized that if I wanted to keep awake and alive I must get a light or open a blind, so as to fix my eyes on something. And besides, I was cold. I groped for the studs. I lit the little lamp and saw, floating in the void, an old newspaper that I had brought with me from the earth. That brought me out of the infinite to my real self again. I lit the heater until I felt warm, and then I took some food. Then I set to work very cautiously on the Cavorite blinds, to see if I could guess by any means how the sphere was travelling.</p>

<p>The first blind I opened I shut at once, and hung for a time blinded by the sunlight that had hit me. I started upon the blinds at right angles to this one, and got the huge crescent moon and the little crescent earth behind it. I was amazed to find how far I was from the moon.</p>

<p>I tried to imagine what could have happened to Cavor. I could think of nothing but death. I seemed to see him, bent and smashed at the foot of some high waterfall of blue. And all about him the stupid insects stared&#160;...&#160;</p>

<p>Under the touch of the drifting newspaper I became practical again for a while. It was quite clear to me that I was drifting away from the earth. I set myself to think how the return to earth could be accomplished. I did a very great deal of complicated thinking over this problem, and in the end I am certain it was much more my good luck than my reasoning that enabled me to hit the earth.</p>

<p>I opened all my moonward blinds, in order to gather speed, and waited for the crescent to get bigger and bigger until I felt I was near enough for safety. Then I shut out the sight of the moon from my eyes, and flew past it. I opened an earthward blind and sat down to begin a watch in the sphere until I should strike the earth. The heater had made the sphere tolerably warm, and except for that queer sensation in the head that was always with me while I was away from the earth, I was quite comfortable. I had put out the light again, lest it should fail me in the end; I was in darkness, except for the earth-shine and the glitter of the stars below me. Everything was so absolutely silent and still that I might indeed have been the only being in the universe, and yet, strangely enough, I had no more feeling of loneliness or fear than if I had been lying in bed on earth.</p>

<p>I do not know how long I remained in space: sometimes I seemed to have been ages, at others it was a momentary leap from moon to earth. In truth, it was altogether some weeks of earthly time.</p>

<p>At last I began to feel the pull of the earth upon me, and I set myself to think of the conditions under which I must fall to earth.</p>
