<p class="storyTitle">THE MARRIAGE</p>

<p>The morning sun rose clear and beautiful, making the sky golden, and the white-topped waves like bright snow.</p>

<p>A wonderful meal had been prepared at La Reserve for the marriage. The gathering had been fixed for twelve, but the room was already full of people. Many of the men from the <i>Pharaoh</i> were there, and other friends of Dantes, all in their best clothes. It was said that Mr. Morrel had promised to come.</p>

<p>Danglars and Caderousse appeared and said that this was a fact; Mr. Morrel was really coming. Just then loud shouts from the courtyard showed that Mr. Morrel had arrived. The men of the <i>Pharaoh</i> understood from this that Dantes would be their next captain. Dantes was much loved by the men, so they shouted loud and long.</p>

<p>Danglars and Caderousse were sent to tell Edmond that so important a person had arrived, and to tell him to hurry to receive him. They set off quickly; but, when they had gone a few steps, they saw a party of people walking towards them&#151;Edmond and Mercedes, some young girls attending on Mercedes, Dantes' father, and, last, Fernand upon whose face rested a strange look.</p>

<p>As soon as they came in sight of La Reserve, Mr. Morrel went out to meet them. Edmond placed the hand of Mercedes on Mr. Morrel's arm and Mr. Morrel led her up the steps into the room.</p>

<p>Mercedes stopped when she reached the centre of the table. "Mr. Morrel," she said, "you are acting in the place of my dead father; so you must sit on my right. On my left I will place him who has been as a brother to me." She turned with a gentle look to Fernand. But her words and her look seemed to give Fernand pain, for his face became white.</p>

<p>All sat down at the table and began to eat. Loud was the talk and the laughing.</p>

<p>"Well," said Caderousse to Danglars, as he looked round at the happy faces, "I really think Dantes is a very good fellow. I am glad that we did not send that after all."</p>

<p>"At first," said Danglars, "I was a little afraid of what Fernand might do. But now that I see him sitting there beside Mercedes, I see that there can be no cause for fear."</p>

<p>Caderousse looked at Fernand, whose face was still white as death.</p>

<p>"That new captain of mine," continued Danglars, with a look towards Mercedes, "should be a happy fellow. I only wish he would let me take his place."</p>

<p>"Shall we set forth?" asked the sweet silvery voice of Mercedes. "It is now two, and we are expected at the church within fifteen minutes."</p>

<p>"Certainly!" cried Dantes, leaving the table. "Let us go at once."</p>

<p>The whole party rose up, and began to form themselves in line.</p>

<p>Danglars had been watching every change in Fernand's looks: he now saw him fall back against a seat near one of the open windows. And just then his ear caught a sound outside, the sound of soldiers marching; then many voices. And then a death-like silence. There was the sound of a man striking the door&#151;three times.</p>

<p>"Open, in the name of the Law!"</p>

<p>An officer entered, followed by four soldiers.</p>

<p>"Who answers to the name of Edmond Dantes?"</p>

<p>"That is my name," said Edmond. "Why?"</p>

<p>"I cannot tell you. You will be told the reason later."</p>

<p>"Do not be afraid, my good fellows," said Dantes, turning to his friends. "There is some little mistake, which will soon be put right. That is all, I am sure."</p>

<p>"Quite sure!" said Danglars. "Nothing more than a mistake, I feel quite certain."</p>

<p>Dantes went down to the courtyard followed by the soldiers.</p>

<p>"God be with you, dearest Edmond," cried Mercedes, holding out her arms to him from the window.</p>

<p>"And with you, sweet Mercedes," he cried. "We shall soon meet again."</p>
