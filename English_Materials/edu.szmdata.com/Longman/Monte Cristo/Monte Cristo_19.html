<p class="chapter">Nineteen</p>

<p class="storyTitle">AT MARSEILLES</p>

<p>When daylight came Dantes climbed to the top of the highest rock to see if there were any houses or men on the island. There were none. It was truly a desert island, hard rock, with only some trees and grass on the thin soil of the lower parts.</p>

<p>Returning to the treasure-place, he raised the stone, then went into the farther room and took as many jewels as he could safely hide in his clothing. Then he put back the earth over the box, and put sand over the place, so that no one might know that the earth there had ever been moved. He then put a large stone over the opening and covered it with earth, and set there also some quick-growing plants. Then he went over the ground all round about, hiding every footmark. He left the place looking as if it had never been visited.</p>

<p>This done, he set himself to wait for the return of his friends. This was no easy matter. It was no joy to him to sit and watch over his great treasure. He felt the desire now to return to live among men, and he knew well the power which these riches would give him. Danglars, Caderousse, even Villefort, would be as nothing to him now&#151;little people not worth his thought. What good might he not do with so much money! and what joy he could bring to those who were nearest his heart!</p>

<p>After six days <i>The Young Amelia</i> returned. From a distance Dantes knew the shape of her sails and her manner of sailing. He went down to the shore, pretending that his knee still pained him, and asked how the business had gone on.</p>

<p>They answered that they got the goods safely to land. But, just as they had finished, they heard that a Government ship had just left Toulon and was hurrying to catch them. They went off as quickly as possible, and wished that Dantes had been with them, for he could have helped them much. As it was, they were almost caught when, happily, night came on, and they were able to turn back on their course and so get away.</p>

<p>They were all very sorry that Dantes should not get his part of the gains, which, they said, were large. It was all Dantes could do not to laugh at this; how much he would have gained if he had only gone with them!</p>

<p><i>The Young Amelia</i> had come to Monte Cristo only to take him off. He went on board and the ship sailed for Leghorn.</p>

<p>&#160;</p>

<p>At Leghorn Dantes went to the house of a certain merchant whom he knew, and sold to him four of his smallest stones. Dantes was half afraid that questions might be asked at finding such jewels in the hands of a common seaman. But the merchant said nothing, having paid for them far less than they were worth.</p>

<p>On the next day Dantes gave Jacopo an entirely new ship and a present of money also. He then went to the Captain and told him that a large amount of money had been left to him by his uncle who had just died, and that he wished to leave ship. The Captain was sad at losing him, and did all he could to get him to stay. Dantes gave such fine presents to the men that they all wished him every possible happiness.</p>

<p>This done, Dantes left Leghorn for Genoa.</p>

<p>Arriving at Genoa, he saw a beautiful little ship being tried in the bay. It had just been built by the order of an Englishman: it was so small that Dantes felt that he could sail it himself, alone, without help: it was so fast that no other ship upon the water would catch it.</p>

<img src="imgs/map.jpg"/>

<p>Dantes, offering a very large amount of money over the proper price, asked the builder to let him have it with all its ship's papers. The Englishman was not expected for some months, and in that time the man thought he could build another ship of the kind. So the matter was settled.</p>

<p>The builder offered to find seamen for the ship, but Dantes said he needed none; that he was used to sailing alone; that indeed the whole pleasure of sailing lay in doing everything for himself. But he asked the man if he would make for him a hidden place in the ship, with three separate parts in it. This might be made just at the head of his bed. The builder promised to have this ready by the next day.</p>

<p>&#160;</p>

<p>On the next day Dantes sailed away from Genoa, alone. A large crowd had come together to see the rich English gentleman who always sailed his ship himself. There were cries of wonder when they saw how perfectly the ship moved under his hand. Indeed Dantes knew that the men of Genoa, who are the masters of shipbuilding, had never made anything so perfect.</p>

<p>The people followed the ship with their eyes so long as they could see it. Then they began to wonder where it was going. Some said Corsica; others the Island of Elba; others thought it might be Africa. But none thought of Monte Cristo.</p>

<p>It was there that Dantes guided his ship; and on the second day he arrived. She had covered the distance from Genoa in thirty-five hours. Dantes had carefully noticed the line of the shore, and instead of going to the usual place, he took his ship into the little bay.</p>

<p>There was no one on the island. It seemed as if no one had been there since he went away. The treasure was just as he had left it.</p>

<p>Early on the next morning he began the work of carrying his riches on board. Before night came, the whole of the treasure was safely stored in the hidden place.</p>

<p>One fine morning a small, but wonderfully beautiful ship sailed into Marseilles. It stopped just near the steps from which, on that never-to-be-forgotten night, Dantes had been put on board the boat which was to take him to Chateau d'If.</p>

<p>The officers of Government came on board to look at the ship's papers. A soldier stood near the steps; even now that sight sent fear into the heart of Dantes.</p>

<p>Dantes had learnt a great deal of English from Faria. He gave to the officers the Englishman's papers which he had got at Genoa, and he spoke to them in bad French.</p>

<p>"There is no reason," said the officers, wishing to please the rich Englishman, "why the gentleman should not go on shore at once, if he wishes to. The papers are all in order."</p>

<p>One of the first men whom he met on the shore was old Nicolas, who had served with him on the <i>Pharaoh</i>. He went straight up to the fellow and asked him a number of questions, carefully watching the man's face. No word or look showed that Nicolas knew the name of the man with whom he was speaking.</p>

<p>He gave him a piece of money and turned away; but before he had gone many steps he heard Nicolas loudly calling him to stop. Dantes turned to meet him.</p>

<p>"You meant," said the good fellow, "to give me a piece of silver, but you have given me this gold by mistake."</p>

<p>"Yes, my good man," said Dantes, "I see I made a small mistake. As thanks for pointing it out to me, take this second piece of gold."</p>

<p>The man was so surprised that he could not speak, but he stood looking after Dantes as he went away. Then he returned, saying to himself, "That must be one of those rich fellows from India. Who else would give money away so freely?"</p>

<p>Dantes continued on his way. Each step he took beat upon his heart with fresh hopes, and fears. Every tree, every street, was crowded with thoughts of the past.</p>

<p>Thus he went on until he arrived at the end of the Noailles road. From there he could see the corner of the street which led to his father's house. At this point, so rich with the thoughts of a father's love, his knees gave way under him; and a darkness came before his eyes. Had he not held on to one of the trees, he would have fallen to the ground. After a few minutes he felt stronger. He passed his hand across his face. Then he went on, and did not stop until he found himself at the door of the house in which his father lived.</p>

<p>The flowers which his father loved were<sup title="The remainder departs from the original: it is added to finish off the story in place of the second volume (which has been omitted)."></sup> still in the window. But, although the day was warm, the window was closed. There seemed to be a strange silence about the place&#151;a silence as if the wings of death were passing over it.</p>

<p>He opened the door. Something white&#151;a letter&#151;lay at his feet. He picked it up. His eyes perhaps were blind; else why could he not read the name? Or why could he not read it properly? It looked like the name of Mercedes. But why? He was dreaming.</p>

<p>&#160;</p>

<p>Dantes came to the door of his father's room. It was shut, but within he heard the sound of quietly moving feet. Then there was silence, broken at last by a weak cry of pain.</p>

<p>And then there came a voice, weak and far, as the voice of a bird lost in the gathering darkness.</p>

<p>Someone answered it very gently: "Yes, soon; very soon now. But keep quiet; you need all your strength."</p>

<p>Dantes put forth his hand to open the door, but it fell back to his side and his feet would not move from the floor.</p>

<p>"But I tell you he is here," said the weak voice again. "Why do you not go and call him in?"</p>

<p>"Try to get a little sleep now. Perhaps when you wake&#160;...&#160;"</p>

<p>"I tell you he is here. Have I not seen him coming up the street, seen him stand beside that tree, and look up at this window with his dear eyes? So changed. So changed."</p>

<p>"Yes, he will be changed, won't he?</p>

<p>"Tell him to come quickly. Tell him that Death waits by my side, waits only until I see him. Open the door, I say." The voice grew stronger with the last glimmer of life. "Open the door, I say, and bring him in!"</p>

<p>There were footsteps. The door opened; and Mercedes stood there, dark-eyed from long watching by that bedside.</p>

<p>She saw him; doubted, finding him so changed; and she fell forward with one cry, as if her heart were broken with the suddenness of too much joy. Then seizing his hand she cried, "Come quickly, so that he may see you."</p>

<p>The old eyes looked up at him, dim and beautiful in their last silent look of love.</p>

<p>The eyes closed. "Kiss me," he said; "hold me in your arms, Edmond&#160;... You may come now, Death."</p>

<p class="c">. . .</p>

<p>At the return of Napoleon in 1815 Danglars had left France; and he had not been seen again: it was believed that his ship was lost in a storm. Fernand was killed at the battle of Waterloo. Caderousse was too old to go as a soldier at that time; he still lived, said Mercedes, but he was very poor.</p>

<p class="c">. . .</p>

<p>"Look," said old Nicolas to the soldier standing by the steps.</p>

<p>On the deep blue line which separates the Mediterranean sea from the sky, was a white sail, no larger than a bird's wing.</p>

<p>"He's gone," said old Nicolas, "that rich Englishman."</p>

<p>"Yes, I saw him go," replied the other; "&#151;and her."</p>
