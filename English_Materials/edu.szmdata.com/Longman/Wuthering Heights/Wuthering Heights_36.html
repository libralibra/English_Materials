<p class="chapter">Chapter 36</p>

<p class="storyTitle">Second visit to the Heights</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">01</span> Cathy gave Mr Heathcliff several looks, as if she could not exactly decide what to think of him, but now he smiled, and softened his voice when addressing her, and I was foolish enough to imagine that the memory of her mother might persuade him not to do her harm.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">02</span> Linton stood by the fireplace. He had been out walking in the fields, and was calling for Joseph to bring him dry shoes. He had grown tall, and his face was still pretty, and his eye and skin healthier than I remembered them.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">03</span> 'Now, who is that?' asked Mr Heathcliff, turning to Cathy.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">04</span> Cathy looked doubtfully from one to the other.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">05</span> 'Your son?' she said.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">06</span> 'Yes,' he answered. 'You have a short memory. Linton, don't you remember your cousin, whom you were always wishing to see?'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">07</span> 'What, Linton!' cried Cathy, in joyful surprise. 'Is that really little Linton? He's taller than I am!'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">08</span> She sprang forward and kissed him. They stared in wonder at the changes that time had made in their appearance. Cathy had reached her full height, and she shone with health and spirits. Linton's looks and movements lacked energy, but there was a certain grace in his manner.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">09</span> Cathy turned to Heathcliff. 'And you are my uncle, then!' she cried, reaching up to kiss him also. 'I thought I liked you, though you were disagreeable at first. Why don't you visit the Grange with Linton? Naughty Ellen!' she continued, turning to me, 'wicked Ellen, to try to hinder me from entering!'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">10</span> 'Don't waste your kisses on me,' said her uncle, scarcely hiding his disgust. 'I think I'd better tell you, Mr Linton has a prejudice against me. We quarrelled at one time in our lives. If you mention your visit here, he will forbid you to come again.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">11</span> 'Why did you quarrel?' asked Cathy, greatly surprised and disappointed.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">12</span> 'He thought me too poor to marry his sister,' answered Heathcliff, 'and was upset when I got her.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">13</span> 'That's wrong!' said the young lady. 'Some time I'll tell him so. But Linton and I have no share in your quarrel. I'll not come here, but he shall come to the Grange.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">14</span> 'It is too far,' murmured her cousin. 'To walk four miles would kill me.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">15</span> The father looked with bitter scorn at his son.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">16</span> 'Have you nothing to show your cousin?' he said. 'Take her into the garden before you change your shoes.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">17</span> 'Wouldn't you rather sit here?' Linton asked Cathy, rather unwillingly.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">18</span> 'I don't know,' she replied, glancing at the door.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">19</span> He kept his seat, and drew closer to the fire. Heathcliff rose and called out for Hareton. Hareton replied and soon appeared. He had been washing himself, as was noticeable by his shining cheeks, and his wetted hair.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">20</span> 'That's not my cousin, Uncle, is he?' cried Cathy.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">21</span> 'Yes,' he replied. 'Your mother's nephew. Don't you like him?'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">22</span> Cathy looked uncertain. She reached up and whispered a sentence in Heathcliff's ear. He laughed, and Hareton's face became dark. But his master, or guardian, chased the displeasure away by exclaiming:</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">23</span> 'You'll be the favourite among us, Hareton! She said something very nice about you. Go round the farm with her, and behave like a gentleman. Don't use any bad words, and don't fix your eyes on her, and speak slowly, and keep your hands out of your pockets.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">24</span> He watched the pair walking past the window. Hareton would not look at his companion.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">25</span> 'I've tied his tongue,' remarked Heathcliff with satisfaction. 'He'll be afraid to say a word. Nelly, you remember me at his age—no, a few years younger—did I ever look so stupid?'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">26</span> 'Worse,' I replied, 'because more evil-tempered.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">27</span> 'I've a pleasure in him,' he continued. 'If he were a born fool I should not enjoy it half as much. I can sympathize with all his feelings, having felt them myself. He'll never be able to escape from his coarseness and ignorance, because I've taught him to take a pride in his condition. I've got him faster than his father ever had me. And the best of it is, Hareton is extremely fond of me. If his father could rise from the grave and accuse me of wronging his child, that child would fight him to protect me as his one friend in the world!'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">28</span> He gave a wicked laugh. Meanwhile Linton, perhaps regretting the loss of Cathy's company, began to be restless. He got up and stepped outside.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">29</span> Cathy was asking Hareton what the words over the door were. Hareton looked up, and scratched his head.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">30</span> 'Some writing,' he answered. 'I can't read it.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">31</span> Linton gave a silly little laugh.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">32</span> 'He doesn't even know his letters,' he said to Cathy. 'Did you ever see anyone so ignorant? There's nothing the matter but laziness, is there, Hareton? Have you noticed his bad pronunciation? He scorns "book-learning", as he calls it.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">33</span> 'Why? What's the use of it?' said Hareton.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">34</span> Linton and Cathy burst into a noisy fit of laughter, and the poor, angry youth went away, his face burning with fury and shame. Mr Heathcliff smiled as he saw him go, but afterwards I saw him direct a look of hate at the heartless pair, who continued to enjoy their sense of superiority. I began to dislike, more than to pity Linton, and to excuse his father in some degree for thinking badly of him.</p>
