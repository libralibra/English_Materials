<p class="chapter">Chapter 17</p>

<p class="storyTitle">Welcome and not welcome</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">01</span> Heathcliff followed me up without further speech, and I brought him into the presence of the master and mistress, whose red cheeks showed signs of warm argument. The lady sprang forward, took both his hands, and led him to Linton; then she seized Linton's unwilling fingers and pressed them into his.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">02</span> Now clearly shown up by the fire and candlelight, the change in Heathcliff astonished me more than ever. He had grown into a tall, active, well-formed man, beside whom my master seemed a mere youth. His upright appearance suggested that he had been in the army. His face was older in expression and firmer in shape; it looked intelligent, and had lost all former marks of degradation. A half-civilized fierceness lay hidden in the eyes, but his manner was serious, even gentlemanly, and quite without roughness. My master's surprise equalled or went beyond mine, and for a minute he was puzzled as to how to receive the ploughboy, as he called him.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">03</span> 'Sit down, sir,' he said at last. 'It is Mrs Linton's wish that you should be welcomed here, and of course I am delighted to give her pleasure.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">04</span> 'And I also,' answered Heathcliff. 'I shall stay an hour or two willingly.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">05</span> He took a seat opposite Catherine, who kept her eyes fixed on him. He did not raise his eyes to her often, but each time they expressed more confidently the pure delight he felt in her presence.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">06</span> 'I shall think it a dream tomorrow,' cried Catherine. 'And yet, cruel Heathcliff, you don't deserve this welcome. To be absent and silent for three years, and never think of me!'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">07</span> 'A little more than you have thought of me,' he replied. 'I heard of your marriage, Cathy, not long ago, and while waiting below, I planned to have just one quick look at you, take my revenge on Hindley, and then prevent the law by putting an end to my own life. Your welcome has put such ideas out of my head. I've fought through a bitter life since I last heard your voice, and you must forgive me, because I struggled only for you!'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">08</span> 'Catherine, unless we are to have cold tea, please come to the table,' interrupted Linton, trying to speak in his ordinary voice, but pale with annoyance.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">09</span> Catherine took up her post, and Miss Isabella came in. The meal was over in a few minutes. Catherine's cup was never filled: she could neither eat nor drink. Edgar hardly swallowed a mouthful.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">10</span> Their guest did not stay more than an hour longer. I asked, as he left, if he was going to Gimmerton.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">11</span> 'No, to Wuthering Heights,' he answered. 'I called this morning, expecting you would still be there, Nelly, and could give me news of Catherine. There were some persons there sitting at cards, whom I joined, and finding I have plenty of money now, Hindley invited me to repeat my visit. I shall try to stay there, so as to be within walking distance of Catherine. Hindley is greedy, and I shall pay him well.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">12</span> Mr Earnshaw invited <em>him</em>! I had a feeling in my heart the Heathcliff should have remained away.</p>
