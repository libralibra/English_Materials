<p class="chapter">Chapter 34</p>

<p class="storyTitle">Linton's welcome home</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">01</span> To avoid the danger of this threat being carried out, Mr Linton ordered me to take the boy home early, on Cathy's pony. He added:</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">02</span> 'You must say nothing to my daughter of where he has gone. She cannot see him in future. Merely tell her that his father sent for him suddenly, and he has had to leave us.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">03</span> Young Linton was very unwilling to be wakened from his sleep at five o'clock in the morning, and astonished to find he must prepare for further travelling. I softened the matter by saying that he was going to spend some time with his father, who was anxious to see him without delay.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">04</span> 'My father!' cried the boy. 'Mama never told me that I had a father. Why didn't Mama and he live together, as other people do?'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">05</span> 'He had business to keep him in the north,' I answered, 'and your mother's health made it necessary for her to live in the south.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">06</span> The boy was not satisfied.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">07</span> 'Mama didn't speak to me about him,' he repeated. 'She often talked of Uncle, and I learnt to love him. How am I to love Papa?'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">08</span> 'All children love their parents,' I said. 'Let's make haste. An early ride on a beautiful morning is better than another hour's sleep.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">09</span> 'Is <em>she</em> to go with us—the little girl I saw yesterday?'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">10</span> 'Not now.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">11</span> 'Is Uncle?'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">12</span> 'No. I shall be your companion there.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">13</span> Linton sank back upon his pillow. 'I won't go without Uncle,' he said at last.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">14</span> I had to call for my master's assistance in getting him out of bed. The poor thing was got off in the end with several declarations that his visit would be short, that his uncle and Cathy would visit him, and other promises, equally without truth, that I invented from time to time. At last, in the pure air and the sunshine, he began to brighten on the way, and to put questions about his new home. Was Wuthering Heights as pleasant a place as Thrushcross Grange? Was his father as good-looking as his uncle?</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">15</span> 'The house is not quite so large,' I told him, 'but it is the second in the district. Your father is as young as your uncle, but he has black hair and eyes, and looks more severe. He'll not seem so kind and gentle at first, perhaps, because it is not his nature, but of course he'll be fonder of you than any uncle, since you are his own.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">16</span> The boy was fully occupied with his own thoughts for the rest of the ride. It was half-past six when we arrived. The household had just finished breakfast. The servant was taking away the things and wiping down the table.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">17</span> 'Hullo, Nelly!' cried Mr Heathcliff when he saw me. 'You've brought my property, have you? Let me see it.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">18</span> He got up and came to the door. Hareton and Joseph followed, full of curiosity. Poor Linton took a quick, frightened look at all three.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">19</span> 'Surely,' said Joseph, after a careful examination, 'he's changed with you, master, and sent you his girl!'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">20</span> Heathcliff gave a scornful laugh, and a curse.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">21</span> 'What a beauty! What a pretty, charming thing!' he exclaimed. 'It's worse than I expected!'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">22</span> I told the trembling child to get down and enter. He did not quite understand his father's speech, nor was he yet quite certain that this hard, scornful stranger was his father, but he held on to me with growing fear, and when Mr Heathcliff took a seat and ordered him to come to him, he hid his face in my shoulder and wept.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">23</span> 'Come!' said Heathcliff, stretching out a hand and dragging him roughly between his knees. 'None of that nonsense. We're not going to hurt you, Linton—isn't that your name? You're entirely like your mother. Where is <em>my</em> share in you?'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">24</span> He took off the boy's cap and pushed back his thick fair curls and felt his thin arms and small fingers. Linton stopped crying and lifted his great blue eyes to examine the examiner. </p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">25</span> 'Do you know me?' asked Heathcliff.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">26</span> 'No,' said Linton, with a look of fear.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">27</span> 'No? What a shame of your mother, never to waken your feeling for me! You are my son. Be a good boy, and I'll look after you. Nelly, if you are tired, sit down. If not, get home. This thing won't be settled while you're still about.' </p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">28</span> 'Well,' I replied, 'I hope you'll be kind to the boy, Mr Heathcliff, or he won't live long.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">29</span> 'I'll be <em>very</em> kind to him, you needn't fear,' he said, laughing. 'And to begin my kindness—Joseph! Bring the boy some breakfast. Hareton! Get to your work.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">30</span> 'Yes,' he added, when they had gone, 'my son is the future owner of your place, and I should not wish him to die until I am certain of being his heir. Besides, he's <em>mine</em>, and I want the pleasure of seeing <em>my</em> son fairly lord of <em>their</em> property, <em>my</em> child hiring their children to cultivate their fathers' lands for wages. It's only such a thought that makes me able to bear the miserable thing. He's worthless in himself, and I hate him for the memories he brings back! But he's safe with me. I have a room upstairs, finely furnished for him. I've hired a teacher to come three times a week. I've ordered Hareton to obey him. In fact, I've arranged everything to keep him a gentleman. I do regret, though, that he so little deserves the trouble. If I wished any blessing in the world, it was to find him a worthy object of pride, and I'm bitterly disappointed in the milk-faced baby!'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">31</span> While he was speaking, Joseph returned with a bowl of porridge, and placed it in front of Linton. He stirred the simple food with a look of disgust, and declared he could not eat it.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">32</span> Joseph was angry, but Heathcliff ordered the housekeeper to give him whatever he wanted to eat. Having no excuse for staying any longer, I slipped out while Linton was looking at a friendly sheepdog. But as I closed the door, I heard a cry, and a despairing repetition of the words:</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">33</span> 'Don't leave me! I won't stay here! I won't stay here!'</p>
