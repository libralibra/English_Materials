<p class="chapter">Chapter 10</p>

<p class="storyTitle">Catherine's homecoming</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">01</span> Cathy stayed at Thrushcross Grange for five weeks: till Christmas. By that time her ankle was cured, and her manners much improved. She had learnt to enjoy fine clothes and admiration, so that instead of a wild, hatless, uncivilized little thing jumping into the house and rushing up to us, there got down with grace from a fine black pony, a well-dressed little person, very careful of her appearance. Hindley lifted her from her horse, exclaiming with delight, 'Why, Cathy, you are quite a beauty! You look a lady now.' </p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">02</span> The dogs came leaping up to welcome her, but she hardly dared touch them for fear that they should spoil her splendid dress. She kissed me carefully: I had flour on me from making the Christmas cake. Then she looked round for Heathcliff.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">03</span> He was hard to find, at first. Since Cathy had been away, he had been ten times more neglected than before. There was no one but me even to tell him to wash himself. His clothes had seen long service in mud and dust, his thick hair was uncombed, his face and hands needed soap and water. He had good reason to hide.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">04</span> 'Heathcliff, you may come forward,' cried Mr Hindley, enjoying his humiliation. 'You may come and wish Miss Catherine welcome, like all the other servants.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">05</span> Cathy flew to kiss her friend seven or eight times on his cheek, and then stopped, and drawing back, burst into a laugh, exclaiming, 'Why, how very black and disagreeable you look! But that's because I'm used to Edgar and Isabella Linton.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">06</span> 'Shake hands, Heathcliff,' said Hindley, in a superior voice.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">07</span> Shame and pride kept the boy immovable.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">08</span> 'I shall not,' he said at last. 'I shall not stand to be laughed at.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">09</span> He would have broken from the circle, but Miss Cathy seized him again.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">10</span> 'I didn't mean to laugh at you,' she said. 'It was only that you looked so peculiar. You're so dirty!'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">11</span> She looked anxiously at her dress, fearing that he had marked it.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">12</span> 'You needn't have touched me,' he answered, following her eye. 'I shall be as dirty as I please.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">13</span> With that, he rushed from the room, followed by the laughter of my master and mistress. Cathy was very upset and could not understand his bad temper.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">14</span> It was the evening before Christmas day. Joseph had gone to pray. I sat alone in the kitchen, remembering my old master and his kindness to me. From these thoughts I passed to his fondness for Heathcliff and his fear that the boy should suffer neglect after his death.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">15</span> Catherine was in the sitting room with her brother and his wife, looking at the presents they had bought for her to give to the Lintons. I found Heathcliff in the stable.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">16</span> 'Make haste, Heathcliff,' I said. 'Let me make you tidy before Miss Cathy comes out, and then you can sit together by the fire in the kitchen and have a long talk till bedtime.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">17</span> He went on with his work, and never turned his head. </p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">18</span> Cathy sat up late, preparing for her new friends, who were to visit her the next day. She came into the kitchen once to speak to her old friend, but he was not there.</p>
