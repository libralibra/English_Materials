<p class="chapter">Chapter 55</p>

<p class="storyTitle">The dead are at peace</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">01</span> Mrs Dean was silent for a minute at the end of her story.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">02</span> 'They are going to the Grange, then?' I asked.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">03</span> 'Yes, as soon as they are married, and that will be on New Year's day.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">04</span> 'And who will live here?'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">05</span> 'Why, Joseph will take care of the house, with perhaps a boy to keep him company. They will live in the kitchen, and the rest of the house will be shut up.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">06</span> 'For the use of such ghosts as choose to haunt it,' I remarked.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">07</span> 'No, Mr Lockwood,' said Nelly, shaking her head, 'I believe that the dead are at peace.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">08</span> At that moment the garden gate opened. The wanderers were returning.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">09</span> '<em>They</em> are afraid of nothing,' I said.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">10</span> As they stepped up to the door, and paused to take a last look at the moon, or rather, at each other, by her light, l felt a desire to avoid them, and hastily saying goodbye to Mrs Dean, I passed through the kitchen and left.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">11</span> My walk home was lengthened by a turn in the direction of the churchyard. I looked for, and soon discovered, the three stones at the head of the graves on the slope next to the moor: the middle one grey, and half buried in wild plants; Edgar Linton's only covered at the foot with grass, and Heathcliff's still bare.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">12</span> I remained near them, under the mild sky. I watched the insects among the heather and the wild flowers. I listened to the soft wind breathing through the grass. And I wondered how anyone could ever imagine unquiet rest for the sleepers in that quiet earth.</p>
