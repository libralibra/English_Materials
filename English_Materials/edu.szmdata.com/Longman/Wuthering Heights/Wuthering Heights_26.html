<p class="chapter">Chapter 26</p>

<p class="storyTitle">'You have broken your heart and mine'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">01</span> Heathcliff went to the back of her chair, and leant over, but not so far as to let her see his face, which was deathly white. She bent round to look at him; he would not permit it. Turning hastily he walked to the fireplace, where he stood silent, with his back towards us. Catherine looked at him with suspicion, then after a pause she spoke to me in an offended voice.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">02</span> 'You see, Nelly, he will not yield for a moment. <em>That</em> is how I'm loved. Well, never mind. That is not <em>my</em> Heathcliff. I shall love mine still. I wonder he won't be near me,' she went on to herself. 'I thought he wished it. Heathcliff, dear, do come to me.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">03</span> In her eagerness she rose, and supported herself on the arm of the chair. At that earnest request he turned to her, looking absolutely despairing. For an instant they stayed apart, then how they met, I hardly saw. Catherine seemed to spring, and he caught her and held her as if he would never let her go again. I thought my mistress had fainted, but when I approached to see, he turned on me and gathered her to him, half mad with greedy jealousy, so I stood aside, not knowing what to do.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">04</span> Presently a movement of Catherine's relieved me a little. She put her hand to his neck to bring his cheek to hers, while he in turn said wildly:</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">05</span> 'You teach me how cruel you've been—cruel and false! Why did you scorn me? Why were you false to your own heart, Cathy? I have not one word of comfort. You deserve this! You have killed yourself. Yes, you may kiss me, and cry, and force me to do the same—it is your punishment. You loved me—then what <em>right</em> had you to leave me? Because misery, and degradation, and death could not have parted us, <em>you</em>, of your own will, did it! I have not broken your heart—you have broken it, and in breaking it, you have broken mine. It is only the worse for me, that I am strong. Do I want to live? Would <em>you</em> want to live with your soul in the grave?'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">06</span> 'Let me alone,' wept Catherine. 'If I've done wrong, I'm dying for it. You left me too, but I forgive you. Forgive me!'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">07</span> 'It is hard, but I forgive you what you have done to me. I love <em>my</em> murderer—but yours! How can I?'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">08</span> They were silent, their faces hidden against each other, and washed by each other's tears. I became very uncomfortable meanwhile, as the afternoon was passing, and I could see in the sunshine up the valley, a crowd of people outside the church.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">09</span> 'The service is over,' I said. 'Master will be here in half an hour.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">10</span> Heathcliff groaned a curse and drew Catherine closer. She never moved.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">11</span> Soon I saw a group of the servants coming up the road. Then Edgar Linton opened the gate and walked through, enjoying the sunny afternoon.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">12</span> 'Now he's here,' I exclaimed.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">13</span> 'I must go, Cathy,' said Heathcliff, 'but, as sure as I'm alive, I'll see you again before you are asleep. I shall be near your window.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">14</span> 'You must not go!' she answered, holding him as firmly as her strength allowed.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">15</span> 'For one hour!' he begged.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">16</span> 'Not for one minute,' she replied.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">17</span> 'I must. Linton will be up immediately.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">18</span> He would have risen, but she hung fast. There was mad determination in her face.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">19</span> 'No! Oh don't, don't go. It is the last time.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">20</span> Heathcliff murmured a curse on Edgar, and sank back into his seat.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">21</span> 'Quiet, my dearest! I'll stay. If he shot me so, I'd die with a blessing on my lips.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">22</span> I heard my master coming up the stairs.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">23</span> 'She doesn't know what she says!' I cried. 'Will you ruin her, because she has not sense enough to help herself? Get up! We are all done for!'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">24</span> Mr Linton hastened his step at the noise. I saw that Catherine's arms had fallen, and her head hung down.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">25</span> 'She's fainted or dead,' I thought.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">26</span> Edgar sprang at his uninvited guest, white with astonishment and fury. What he meant to do, I cannot tell, but the other stopped all motion at once by placing the lifeless-looking form in his arms.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">27</span> 'Unless you be a devil,' he said, 'help her first—then you shall speak to me.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">28</span> He walked into the sitting room. Edgar Linton called me, and with great difficulty we managed to bring Catherine back to life, though she recognized no one. Edgar, in his anxiety, forgot her hated friend. At the earliest opportunity I went to urge him to leave, saying that she was better, and I would give him further news in the morning.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">29</span> 'I shall stay in the garden,' he answered. 'And, Nelly, if you do not keep your word, I shall pay another visit, whether Linton be in or not.'</p>
