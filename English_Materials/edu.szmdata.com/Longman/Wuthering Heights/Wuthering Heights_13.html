<p class="chapter">Chapter 13</p>

<p class="storyTitle">Nelly is not wanted</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">01</span> 'I've not come too soon, have I?' said Edgar, giving me a look.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">02</span> 'No,' answered Catherine. 'What are you doing here, Nelly?'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">03</span> 'My work, Miss,' I replied. Mr Hindley had given me orders to be present at any private visits young Linton chose to pay.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">04</span> She stepped up behind me and whispered:</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">05</span> 'Take yourself and your work off!'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">06</span> 'It's a good opportunity, now that the master is away,' I answered aloud. 'He hates me to do this tidying when he is in the room. I'm sure Mr Edgar will excuse me.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">07</span> She, supposing that Edgar could not see her, pulled the cloth from my hand, and pinched me very sharply on the arm. She hurt me extremely, and besides, I enjoyed punishing her pride, so I got up from my knees and screamed out:</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">08</span> 'Oh, Miss, that's a nasty trick! You've no right to pinch me.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">09</span> 'I didn't touch you, you lying thing!' she exclaimed, her fingers ready to repeat the act, and her ears red with fury.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">10</span> 'What's this, then?' I replied, showing the marks on my arm.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">11</span> She struck the ground with her foot; then, driven by the naughty spirit within her, hit me on the cheek, a blow that filled both eyes with water.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">12</span> 'Catherine! Catherine!' exclaimed Edgar, deeply upset by the double fault of lying and violence.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">13</span> Little Hareton, who followed me everywhere, and was sitting near me on the floor, began crying himself and talking of 'wicked Aunt Cathy', which turned her fury against him. She seized his shoulders and shook him till the child became pale, and Edgar, without thinking, took hold of her hands to deliver him. In an instant one hand was pulled free, and the astonished young man felt it on his own ear in a way that could not be mistaken for a joke.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">14</span> The insulted visitor moved to the place where he had put down his hat, pale and with a trembling lip.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">15</span> 'Where are you going?' demanded Catherine, advancing to the door.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">16</span> 'Can I stay after you have struck me?' asked Edgar.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">17</span> Catherine was silent.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">18</span> 'You've made me afraid and ashamed of you,' he continued. 'I'll not come here again.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">19</span> Catherine's tears began to fall.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">20</span> 'And you told an untruth,' he said.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">21</span> 'Well, go, if you please! Get away! And now I'll cryâ€”I'll cry till I'm sick!'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">22</span> She dropped down on her knees by a chair.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">23</span> Edgar kept his determination as far as the yard, and then he looked back through the window. He possessed the power to go away as much as a cat possesses the power to leave a mouse half-killed, or a bird half-eaten. He turned and hastened into the house again, and shut the door behind him.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">24</span> When I went in later to inform them that Earnshaw had come home furiously drunk, I saw that the quarrel had merely brought them closer, and assisted them to put off the appearance of friendship, and confess themselves lovers.</p>
