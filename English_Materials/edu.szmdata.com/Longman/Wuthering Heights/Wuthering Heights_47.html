<p class="chapter">Chapter 47</p>

<p class="storyTitle">I revisit the Heights</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">01</span> Soon after recovering from my illness last year, I left Thrushcross Grange and returned to London. The loneliness and wildness of the district had not suited me at all, and soon I had almost forgotten my stay there.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">02</span> But this September, I was invited to the north for the shooting season, and on my journey to my friend's property, I unexpectedly came within fifteen miles of Gimmerton. A sudden desire to visit Thrushcross Grange again seized me.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">03</span> It seemed to me I might as well pass the night under my own roof, as at an inn. Besides, I could easily spare a day to arrange matters with my landlord, as I had warned him that when my agreed year as his tenant was at an end in October, I did not intend to keep the house.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">04</span> I rode into the courtyard at the Grange and saw an old woman sitting on the steps.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">05</span> 'Is Mrs Dean inside?' I asked.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">06</span> 'Mrs Dean? No!' she answered. 'She doesn't live here. She's up at the Heights now.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">07</span> Having given orders for arrangements for my comfort for the night, I left the park and climbed the stony road to Mr Heathcliff's home just as the sun was setting.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">08</span> This time I had neither to unchain the gate, nor to knock. A sweet scent of garden flowers hung on the air. The doors and windows were open, and two members of the household, seated just inside, could be both seen and heard. I paused.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">09</span> A voice, as sweet as a silver bell, was ordering someone else to read some sentences correctly.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">10</span> A deep male voice began to read. The speaker was a young man, respectably dressed, and seated at a table, with a book in front of him. His good-looking face shone with pleasure, and his eyes kept wandering impatiently from the page to a small white hand over his shoulder. Its owner stood behind, her light, shining curls touching, now and then, his brown hair, as she bent to examine his studies. It was lucky he could not see her pretty face, or he would never have been so steady.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">11</span> The lesson was completed, not free from mistakes, but the pupil claimed a reward, and received kisses that he generously returned. Then Cathy and Hareton, for it was them that I was watching, came to the door, and from their conversation, I judged they were about to go for a walk on the moor. Clearly, an interruption by me would not be welcome.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">12</span> I went round to find the kitchen. Here, too, the door was open, and at it sat my old friend Nelly Dean, sewing and singing a song, which was often interrupted from inside by the complaining voice of old Joseph.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">13</span> Mrs Dean jumped to her feet, crying:</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">14</span> 'Why, it's Mr Lockwood! How could you think of returning in this way? All's shut up at the Grange.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">15</span> 'I am leaving again tomorrow,' I answered. 'And how have you come here?'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">16</span> 'Zillah left, and Mr Heathcliff wished me to come, soon after you went to London, sir. Have you walked from Gimmerton?'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">17</span> 'From the Grange. And while they prepare my lodging there, I want to finish my business with your master.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">18</span> 'What business, sir? He's gone out at present.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">19</span> 'About the rent.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">20</span> 'Oh! Then it is with Mrs Heathcliff you must settle, or rather with me. She hasn't learnt to manage her affairs yet, and I act for her: there's nobody else.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">21</span> I looked surprised.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">22</span> 'Ah! You haven't heard of Heathcliff's death, I see,' she continued.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">23</span> 'Heathcliff dead? How long ago?'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">24</span> 'Three months. Sit down, and I'll tell you all about it. But stop! You've had nothing to eat, have you?'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">25</span> 'I want nothing. I have ordered supper at home. You sit down, too. I never thought of his dying. You don't expect them back for some timeâ€”the young people?'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">26</span> 'No, I have to scold them every evening for their late wanderings, but they don't listen to me.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">27</span> And then she told me about the strange end of Heathcliff.</p>
