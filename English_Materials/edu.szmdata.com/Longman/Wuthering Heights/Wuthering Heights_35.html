<p class="chapter">Chapter 35</p>

<p class="storyTitle">'Will you walk into my house?'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">01</span> We had sad work with little Cathy that day. She rose in high excitement, eager to join her cousin, and floods of tears followed the news that he had gone.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">02</span> Whenever I chanced, from time to time, to meet the housekeeper from Wuthering Heights in the village, I used to ask how the young master got on, as he lived almost as sheltered a life as Cathy herself, and was never to be seen. I learnt that he was in weak health, and was a difficult person to look after. Mr Heathcliff seemed to dislike him more and more, though he took some trouble to hide it. He could not bear to be for long in the same room with him. Linton learnt his lessons and spent his evenings in a small room of his own, or else lay in bed all day, as he was continually getting coughs and colds, and aches and pains of all sorts.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">03</span> This housekeeper left two years after he came, and another, whom I did not know, took her place.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">04</span> Time passed at the Grange in its former pleasant way till Miss Cathy reached the age of sixteen. On her birthday we never had any sign of rejoicing, because it was also the day of her mother's death. Her father always spent it alone, and walked to the grave, so Cathy was left to amuse herself.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">05</span> This was a beautiful spring day, and my young lady came down early dressed for going out, saying that her father had given her permission to go on the edge of the moors with me, if we only went a short distance.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">06</span> 'So make haste, Ellen!' she said. 'There are some young birds up there. I want to see if they have made their nests yet.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">07</span> 'That must be some distance away,' I answered. 'They don't nest on the edge of the moor.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">08</span> 'No, it's not,' she said. 'I've gone very near with Papa.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">09</span> Thinking no more of the matter, I got myself ready, and we set out. She ran backwards and forwards along the path, and at first I found plenty of entertainment in listening to the birds singing far and near, and enjoying the warm sunshine, and watching my little dear, with her golden curls flying loose behind, and her bright cheek, as soft and pure as a rose, and her eyes shining with pleasure. She was a happy being in those days. It's a pity she couldn't be contented.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">10</span> 'Well,' I said, 'where are your birds, Miss Cathy? We have come a long way.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">11</span> 'Only a little fartherâ€”only a little farther,' was her answer continually.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">12</span> At last I began to weary, and called to her that we must go back. She either did not or would not hear me, and I was forced to follow. She disappeared ahead of me into a hollow, and when I next came in sight of her, she was two miles nearer Wuthering Heights than her own home. I saw two persons arrest her, one of whom was Mr Heathcliff.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">13</span> Cathy had been caught robbing, or at least hunting out the birds on the Heights. This was Mr Heathcliff's land, and he was warning her. She showed him her empty hands.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">14</span> 'I've neither taken nor found any,' she said. 'Papa told me there were plenty up here, and I wished to see the eggs.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">15</span> With an evil smile, Heathcliff asked who 'Papa' was.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">16</span> 'Mr Linton of Thrushcross Grange,' she replied. 'I thought you did not know me. or you wouldn't have spoken in that way.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">17</span> 'You suppose Papa is highly respected, then?' he said in a scornful voice.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">18</span> 'And who are you?' inquired Cathy. 'Is that man your son?'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">19</span> She pointed at Hareton, who looked bigger and stronger than ever, but just as rough and awkward.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">20</span> 'Miss Cathy,' I interrupted, 'we must be getting back home now.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">21</span> 'No, that man is not my son,' answered Heathcliff, pushing me aside. 'But I have one, whom you have seen before. I think both you and your nurse will be the better for a little rest. Will you walk into my house? You shall receive a kind welcome.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">22</span> I whispered to Miss Cathy that she must on no account accept this invitation, but she ran on, and Heathcliff had seized my arm.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">23</span> 'Mr Heathcliff, it's very wrong,' I said. 'You know you mean no good. And as soon as ever we return, I shall have the blame for this.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">24</span> 'I want her to see Linton,' he replied. 'He's looking better these last few days. I want the two cousins to fall in love and get married. It's generous of me, as the girl will have nothing when her father dies.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">25</span> 'Linton's life is quite uncertain,' I said, 'and if he died, Cathy would be the heir to the place.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">26</span> 'No, she would not,' he returned. 'There is no arrangement in the will of that kind. The property would go to me, but to prevent arguments, I desire them to marry.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">27</span> And he led me to the gate, where Miss Cathy was waiting for us.</p>
