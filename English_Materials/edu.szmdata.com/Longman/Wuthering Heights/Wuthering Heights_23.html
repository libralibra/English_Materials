<p class="chapter">Chapter 23</p>

<p class="storyTitle">Two bad months</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">01</span> For two months the runaway pair remained absent, and during those two months Mrs Linton suffered and gradually recovered from the worst shock of what was found to be a brain fever. Day and night Edgar watched over her, patiently bearing all the difficulties of temper caused by illness of both body and mind. The doctor warned him that his own health and strength were being sacrificed for a mere ruin, because his wife would never be the same again, but his joy knew no limits when Catherine's life was declared out of danger. There was double cause for joy, as on her life depended that of another; and we hoped that in a little time Mr Linton's heart would be gladdened, and his lands made safe from the hands of a stranger, by the birth of an heir.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">02</span> The first time she left her room was at the beginning of March. Mr Linton had put on her pillow in the morning a handful of flowers. Her eye caught the bright colour on waking, and shone with delight.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">03</span> 'These are the earliest flowers at the Heights,' she exclaimed. 'They remind me of soft winds and warm sunshine and nearly melted snow.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">04</span> 'The snow has quite gone, my dearest,' said her husband 'Catherine, last spring I was looking forward eagerly to having you under this roof. Now, I wish you were a mile or two up those hills. The air blows so sweetly, I feel it would cure you.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">05</span> The master told me to light a fire in the sitting room, and set a chair in the sunshine. Then he brought her down, and she sat a long while, enjoying the heat. By evening, although very tired, she would not return upstairs, so another room was prepared for her on the same floor, and she was soon strong enough to move from one to the other, leaning on Edgar's arm.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">06</span> About six weeks after Isabella had left, she sent her brother a short note, announcing her marriage to Heathcliff. It appeared dry and cold, but at the bottom was a line in pencil, expressing regret for what she had done, and a desire for forgiveness. Linton did not reply to this, and two weeks later I got a letter from the unhappy girl, which I have kept till now.</p>

<blockquote class="faceMono">

<p class="z">Dear Ellen,</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">07</span> I came last night to Wuthering Heights and heard for the first time that Catherine has been, and is still, very ill. I must not write to her, I suppose, and my brother is either, too angry or too unhappy to answer what I send him.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">08</span> Inform Edgar that my heart returned to the Grange twenty-four hours after I left. I can't follow it, however.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">09</span> I wonder how you managed, when you lived here, to remain human. Is Heathcliff mad or is he a devil? I beg you to explain, if you can, what I have married.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">10</span> We got here after sunset. Your old fellow servant brought out a light, gave me an ugly look, and took away the horses. Heathcliff stayed to speak to him, and I entered the kitchen, a dirty, untidy hole. I dare say you wouldn't recognize it: it is so changed since it was in your care. By the fire stood a rough-looking, dirty child, rather like Catherine in the eyes and about the mouth, whom I realized must be Hareton. I tried to make friends, but he first cursed, and then set a dog on me.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">11</span> I wandered round the yard, and knocked at a door. It was opened by a tall man, very untidily dressed, with masses of uncut hair. He, too, was like our Catherine. It was her brother. He let me in and shut the door. I saw I was in the huge room that used to look so bright and cheerful when I visited it years ago. Now it is dusty and uncared-for. I asked if I might call the maid and be shown to a bedroom. Mr Earnshaw did not answer. He appeared to have forgotten my presence, and seemed so strange and unwelcoming that I hesitated to disturb him again.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">12</span> I remembered that four miles away lay my delightful home, containing the only people I love on earth; yet there might as well be the ocean between us!</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">13</span> At last I repeated my question.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">14</span> "We have no maid," said Earnshaw. "You must wait on yourself."</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">15</span> "Where must I sleep, then?" I wept. I was tired and miserable.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">16</span> "Joseph will show you Heathcliff's room," he replied. "Be so good as to turn your key and fasten the door."</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">17</span> "Bat why, Mr Earnshaw?" I asked.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">18</span> "Look here!" he said, pulling from his pocket a curiously made small gun, having a double-edged knife fixed to it. "I can't help going up with this every night and trying his door. If once I find it open, he'll be a dead man!"</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">19</span> "What has Heathcliff done to you?" I asked. "Wouldn't it be wiser to order him to leave the house?"</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">20</span> "No!" shouted Earnshaw. "Am I to lose all my money, without a chance of winning it back? Is Hareton to be a beggar? I WILL have it back, and I'll have HIS gold, too, and his blood!"</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">21</span> You know your old master's habits, Ellen. He is clearly near to madness. I'm afraid to be near him.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">22</span> Heathcliff's room was locked. I went to sleep in a chair in the sitting room, till he came in with the news of Catherine's illness, and accused my brother of causing it. He promised to punish me in his place, till he could get hold of him.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">23</span> I am miserable—I have been foolish! Say nothing of this to anyone at the Grange. Call and see me, Ellen, very soon. I shall expect you every day—don't disappoint me!</p>

<p class="signature">Isabella</p>
