<p class="chapter">Chapter 1</p>

<p class="storyTitle">A rough welcome</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">01</span> I have just returned from a visit to my landlord, the only neighbour I shall have for many miles. In all England, I don't believe I could have fixed on a country house more completely removed from society.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">02</span> Mr Heathcliff and I are a suitable pair to share this loneliness. As I rode up, his black eyes stared suspiciously at me from under his dark forehead.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">03</span> 'Mr Heathcliff?' I said.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">04</span> He nodded.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">05</span> 'I am Mr Lockwood, your new tenant at Thrushcross Grange, sir. I do myself the honour of calling as soon as possible after my arrival.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">06</span> He made no offer to shake hands. His fingers remained in his pocket.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">07</span> 'Walk in!'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">08</span> He spoke with closed teeth, and continued to lean over the gate. When he saw my horse's chest pushing against it, he did take out his hand to unchain it, and then went before me up the stone path, calling, as we entered the yard:</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">09</span> 'Joseph, take Mr Lockwood's horse, and bring up some wine.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">10</span> 'There must be only one servant,' I thought. 'No wonder the grass grows up between the stones, and cattle seem to be the only hedge-cutters.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">11</span> Joseph seemed a disagreeable old man.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">12</span> 'The Lord help us!' he murmured in a displeased voice, as he took my horse.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">13</span> Wuthering Heights is the name of Mr Heathcliff's house. 'Wuthering' is a local word, used to describe the wildness of the weather in this lonely part of Yorkshire in time of storm. One may guess the power of the north wind blowing over the hillside, by the angle of a few poorly grown trees at the end of the house, and by a row of thorn bushes all stretching their branches one way, as if begging the warmth of the sun.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">14</span> The house is strongly built. The narrow windows are deeply set in the wall, and the corners defended with large stones outside.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">15</span> Before I entered, I paused to admire some curious ornamental stonework over the front. Above it I saw the date '1500' and the name 'Hareton Earnshaw'. I would have asked for a few details about the place, but the owner appeared impatient.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">16</span> One step brought us into the family sitting room. On the wall at one end there was row after row of immense metal dishes, with silver pots and drinking cups right up to the roof. There was no ceiling. Above the fireplace were several evil-looking guns. The floor was of smooth white stone. The chairs were high-backed and painted green. In a corner lay an enormous dog and her young ones. Other dogs haunted other corners.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">17</span> The room and furniture would have been nothing extraordinary if they had belonged to a simple Yorkshire farmer, but Mr Heathcliff seems out of place in his home and way of living. He is a dark-skinned gypsy in appearance, but in manners and dress a gentleman: that is, as much a gentleman as many country landownersâ€”rather careless of his dress, perhaps, but upright and good looking. His expression is rather severe and unsmiling.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">18</span> I took a seat by the fire and filled up a few minutes of silence by trying to make friends with the mother dog.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">19</span> 'You'd better leave her alone,' said Heathcliff roughly, pushing the animal away with his foot, as she showed me all her teeth. Then, crossing to a side door, he shouted again, 'Joseph!'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">20</span> Joseph murmured in the room below, but gave no sign of returning, so his master dived down after him, leaving me face to face with the mother dog and a pair of sheepdogs, who watched all my movements. I sat still, but couldn't help showing my dislike of the animals, and soon the biggest leapt at my knees. I threw her back, and got the table between us. This excited the whole three. Others came out and joined in. I was surrounded, and had to call for help.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">21</span> Mr Heathcliff and his man were slow to answer. Luckily, a big strong woman from the kitchen, with bare arms and cheeks red from cooking, rushed in and drove off the attack with a cooking pan. Heathcliff entered shortly after.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">22</span> 'What the devil is the matter?' he asked.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">23</span> I gave him my opinion of his dogs.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">24</span> 'They won't interfere with persons who touch nothing,' he remarked, putting a bottle before me, and putting the table back into position. 'The dogs are right to be watchful. Take a glass of wine.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">25</span> 'No, thank you.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">26</span> 'Not bitten, are you?'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">27</span> 'If I had been, I would have left my mark on the biter!'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">28</span> Heathcliff laughed.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">29</span> 'Come, come,' he said, 'you are upset, Mr Lockwood. Here, take a little wine. Guests are so rare in this house that I and my dogs, I'm willing to admit, hardly know how to receive them. Your health, sir!'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">30</span> I bowed, beginning to see that it was foolish to be annoyed by a lot of badly-behaved dogs, and feeling, too, unwilling to provide my host with further amusement by losing my temper.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">31</span> He probably realized the foolishness of offending a good tenant. He began to talk with greater politeness, and on a subject that he supposed might interest me. I found him very intelligent, and before I went home I was ready to offer another visit tomorrow. He showed no further wish for my company, but I shall go in spite of this.</p>
