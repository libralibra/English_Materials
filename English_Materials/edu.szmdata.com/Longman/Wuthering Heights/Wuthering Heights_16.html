<p class="chapter">Chapter 16</p>

<p class="storyTitle">The return</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">01</span> Much against my wish, I was persuaded to leave Wuthering Heights and go with Cathy to her new home. Little Hareton was nearly five years old, and I had just begun to teach him his letters. We made a sad parting.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">02</span> When she was at Thrushcross Grange, Catherine behaved much better than I had dared to expect. She seemed almost too fond of Edgar, and even to his sister she showed plenty of affection. I noticed that Mr Edgar had a deep-rooted fear of causing her the least displeasure. In order not to cause grief to a kind master, I learnt to be more careful with my tongue and for the space of half a year the gunpowder lay harmless as sand, because no fire came near to explode it. Catherine had days of low spirits and silence now and then, which her husband respected as the result of her former illness, but I believe they were really in possession of deep and growing happiness.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">03</span> It ended.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">04</span> On a golden evening in September I was coming from the garden with a basket of apples that I had been gathering. It was half dark, and the moon looked over the high wall of the yard, making strange shadows in the corners of the building.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">05</span> My eyes were on the moon, when I heard a voice behind me say:</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">06</span> 'Nelly, is that you?'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">07</span> It was a deep voice, and foreign in sound, yet something in the manner of pronouncing my name made it familiar. Somebody moved near the door of the house, and as I came nearer I saw more clearly a tall man dressed in dark clothes.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">08</span> 'Who can it be?' I thought.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">09</span> A ray of light fell on his face. The cheeks were pale, and half covered with black hair; the forehead was heavy, the eyes deep-set and strange. I recognized the eyes.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">10</span> 'What!' I cried. 'You've come back? Is it really you?'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">11</span> 'Yes, it's Heathcliff,' he replied, looking from me up at the windows. 'Are they at home? Where is she? Speak! I want to have one word with her—with your mistress. Go, and say that some person from Gimmerton village desires to see her.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">12</span> 'How will she take it? How changed you are! Have you been a soldier?'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">13</span> 'Go and carry my message,' he interrupted. 'I'm in torment till you do!'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">14</span> When I got to the sitting room, Mr and Mrs Linton were sitting together at a window looking over the trees and park to the valley and village of Gimmerton. All looked wonderfully peaceful, and I could not persuade myself to speak.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">15</span> I was actually going away leaving the words unsaid, when a sense of my own foolishness forced me to return and give the message.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">16</span> 'Close the curtains, Nelly, and bring up tea. I'll be back again directly.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">17</span> She left the room, and Edgar inquired carelessly who it was.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">18</span> 'Someone that mistress does not expect. That Heathcliff, sir, who used to live at Mr Earnshaw's.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">19</span> 'What! The gypsy—the ploughboy?'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">20</span> 'Take care! You must not call him by those names, master. She was nearly heartbroken when he ran off.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">21</span> Shortly after, Catherine flew upstairs, wild and breathless.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">22</span> 'Oh, Edgar, Edgar,' she exclaimed, throwing her arms round his neck, 'Heathcliff's come back!'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">23</span> 'Well, well,' cried her husband in a disagreeable voice, 'there's no need to be so excited, surely!'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">24</span> 'I know you didn't like him,' she answered, keeping back her delight a little, 'yet, for my sake, you must be friends now. Shall I tell him to come up?'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">25</span> 'Here?' he said. 'Wouldn't the kitchen be a more suitable place?'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">26</span> Mrs Linton looked at him, half angry, half laughing.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">27</span> 'No,' she replied, after a time, 'I can't sit in the kitchen.' </p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">28</span> She was about to run off again, but Edgar stopped her.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">29</span> '<em>You</em> ask him to step up,' he said, addressing me. 'Catherine, the whole household need not witness the sight of your welcoming a runaway servant as a brother.'</p>
