<p class="chapter">Chapter 18</p>

<p class="storyTitle">Miss Isabella</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">01</span> Heathcliff—Mr Heathcliff, I should say in future—used his freedom to visit Thrushcross Grange cautiously at first, and Catherine also judged it wise to be moderate in her show of pleasure in receiving him. My master's anxiety died down, and then, for a time, turned in another direction.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">02</span> The new cause of trouble arose from an unexpected misfortune, Isabella Linton suddenly developed an attraction towards the visitor. She was now a young lady of eighteen, childish in her manners, though possessing a quick understanding and a quick temper, too, if annoyed. Her brother loved her dearly, and besides the shame of a marriage with a man of unknown origin, he had the sense to see that Heathcliff's nature was unchangeable, however much his outward appearance might have improved.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">03</span> We had all noticed during some time, that Miss Linton was pale and unhappy and hard to please, and we had excused her in some degree because her health was weak. One day, when she had been particularly difficult, Mrs Linton threatened to send for the doctor. Isabella exclaimed instantly that her health was perfect, and that it was only Cathy's unkindness that made her unhappy.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">04</span> 'How can you say I am unkind?' cried the mistress, astonished. 'When have I been unkind? Tell me.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">05</span> 'Yesterday,' replied Isabella, weeping.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">06</span> 'Yesterday? On what occasion?'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">07</span> 'In our walk on the moor. You told me to wander where I pleased, while you went on with Mr Heathcliff.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">08</span> 'And that's your idea of unkindness?' said Catherine, laughing.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">09</span> 'You wished me away, because I wanted to be with&#160;...&#160;' </p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">10</span> 'Well?' said Catherine, seeing her hesitate.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">11</span> 'With him, and I won't always be sent off! You are a selfish thing, Cathy, and want no one to be loved but yourself.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">12</span> 'I hope I have misunderstood you, Isabella?'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">13</span> 'No, you have not. I love him more than ever you loved Edgar; and he might love me, if you would let him!'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">14</span> 'I wouldn't like to be you at all, then!' declared Catherine. 'It's only because you haven't the least idea of his real nature that you can allow such a dream to enter your head. Don't imagine that he's got a heart of gold: he's a fierce, pitiless, cruel man. I know he couldn't love a Linton, and yet he might be ready to marry you for your money. There's my picture of him, and I'm his friend.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">15</span> 'For shame! For shame!' cried Isabella. 'You're worse than twenty enemies, you poisonous friend!'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">16</span> 'Put him out of your thoughts, Miss,' I said. 'Mrs Linton spoke strongly, and yet I can't say that she's wrong. She has greater knowledge of his heart than I, or anyone else. Honest people don't hide their deeds. How has he been living? How has he got rich? Why is he staying at Wuthering Heights, with a man whom he hates? They say Mr Hindley is worse and worse since he came. They sit up all night playing cards and drinking, and Hindley has been borrowing money on his land to pay his debts.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">17</span> 'You're as bad as the rest, Ellen,' she replied. 'I shan't listen to your stories.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">18</span> The next day my master had to go to a neighbouring town on business, and Heathcliff, knowing of his absence, called rather earlier than usual. Catherine and Isabella were sitting in the library, unfriendly and silent. The younger lady was alarmed at her own recent foolishness in letting her secret feelings be seen, and Catherine was really offended, and ready to punish her companion. As she saw Heathcliff pass the window, she smiled to herself. Isabella, her head in a book, remained unconscious of the visitor's approach till the door opened, and it was too late to escape, though she would gladly have done so.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">19</span> 'Come in!' exclaimed the mistress gaily, pulling a chair to the fire. 'You're just the person we would both of us choose for our companion. Heathcliff, I'm proud to show you somebody who is fonder of you than myself. My poor little sister-in-law is breaking her heart for you! No, no, Isabella, you shan't run off,' she continued, taking a firm hold of the girl's wrist, as she tried to rise.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">20</span> Heathcliff showed no sign of interest, and Isabella whispered an earnest request to be set free.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">21</span> 'Certainly not!' cried Mrs Linton. 'I won't be called a selfish thing again. Heathcliff, why don't you look pleased?'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">22</span> Heathcliff looked hard at Isabella. 'I think you are mistaken,' he said. 'She wishes to be out of my society now, in any case.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">23</span> The poor girl could not bear it. Her face became white and then red. Catherine still would not let her go, till she began to use her nails.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">24</span> 'What did you mean by tormenting the poor thing in that way, Cathy?' Heathcliff asked, when the door had closed after her. 'You weren't speaking the truth, were you?'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">25</span> 'I promise you I was,' she replied.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">26</span> 'She is her brother's heir isn't she?' he asked, after a short pause.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">27</span> 'Not if I bear a son,' answered his companion. 'Forget this matter. You're too fond of thinking of other people's possessions.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">28</span> They did indeed dismiss the subject from their conversation, but I saw Heathcliff smile evilly to himself when Mrs Linton was out of the room.</p>
