<p class="chapter">Chapter 19</p>

<p class="storyTitle">Evil influence</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">01</span> Mr Heathcliff's visits worried me as well as my master, and his long stay at the Heights was a puzzle with no solution. Sometimes I thought I would go and see how all was at the farm, but then I remembered Mr Hindley's hopelessly bad habits, and I hesitated to re-enter that unhappy house. </p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">02</span> One time I passed near by, on a journey to Gimmerton. It was a bright cold autumn afternoon, but the yellow sunshine reminded me of summer, and I came to the stone marking the way across the moor. It was a favourite place of my childhood, a place loved by Hindley and myself twenty years before. Bending down I saw at the bottom of the rock a hole, where we used to keep our little treasures, still now full of shells and smooth stones, and then, as fresh as reality, it seemed that I saw my former playfellow seated on the grass.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">03</span> The child lifted its face and stared straight into mine. It disappeared at once, but it was waiting for me when I reached the gate of the Heights, and further thought suggested that this must be Hareton, <em>my</em> Hareton, not changed greatly since I left him ten months before.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">04</span> 'God bless you, my little dear!' I cried, forgetting my foolish fears. 'Hareton, it's Nelly, your nurse.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">05</span> He drew back, and picked up a large stone. He didn't recognize me. I began to speak, but the stone struck my head, and the little fellow shouted a string of curses, twisting his baby face into an evil expression that filled me with horror. Ready to weep, I took an orange from my pocket, and offered it. He hesitated, and then seized it from my hand.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">06</span> 'Who taught you those fine words, my child?' I asked. 'The curate?'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">07</span> He swore at me. I offered another orange, but kept it out of reach.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">08</span> 'Tell me where you get your lessons, and you shall have it. Who's your master?'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">09</span> 'Papa.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">10</span> 'And what do you learn from him?'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">11</span> 'Nothing,' he said, 'but to keep out of his way. Papa can't bear me, because I swear at him.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">12</span> 'And who teaches you to swear?'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">13</span> 'Heathcliff.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">14</span> I asked whether he liked Heathcliff.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">15</span> 'Yes.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">16</span> I tried to find out the reason. I could only understand the sentences, 'I don't know; he punishes Papa for what Papa does to meâ€”he curses him. He says I must do as I like.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">17</span> 'And doesn't the curate teach you to read and write, then?' I continued.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">18</span> 'No. Heathcliff promised to knock his teeth out if he came.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">19</span> I put the orange into his hand, and told him to let his father know that a woman called Nelly Dean was waiting to speak to him. He entered the house, but instead of Hindley, Heathcliff appeared at the door, and I turned and ran down the road as hard as I could, as frightened as if I had seen an evil spirit.</p>
