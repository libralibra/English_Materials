<p class="chapter">Chapter 30</p>

<p class="storyTitle">Heathcliff is master indeed</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">01</span> Grief, and a dislike of going anywhere that he was likely to meet Heathcliff, caused my master to lead a lonely life. He avoided the village on all occasions, remaining within the limits of his own grounds, except for walks by himself on the moors and visits to the grave of his dead wife. Time, however, gradually healed the wound, with the help of his little daughter, who soon became queen of his heart. She was named Catherine, but he never called her anything but Cathy, to distinguish her from her mother.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">02</span> The end of Hindley was what might have been expected. It followed six months after his sister's. I found it hard to realize that he was only twenty-seven at the time.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">03</span> When I requested permission to go to Wuthering Heights and assist in the last duties to the dead, Mr Linton was unwilling, but I spoke of Hindley's friendless condition, and said that my old master had a claim on my services as strong as his own. Besides, I reminded him, the child Hareton was his wife's nephew, and he ought to act as guardian. He must inquire how the property was left, and find out the state of his brother-in-law's affairs. He told me to speak to Mr Green, his lawyer, and at last permitted me to go.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">04</span> His lawyer had been Hindley's also. I called at the village, and asked him to go with me. He shook his head and advised that Heathcliff should be left alone, saying, if the truth were known, Hareton would be found little more than a beggar.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">05</span> 'His father died in debt,' he said. 'The whole property is mortgaged, and the only chance for the natural heir is to allow him an opportunity of creating some sympathy in the heart of the possessor of the mortgage, so that he may feel willing to deal generously with him.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">06</span> When I reached the Heights, Joseph appeared glad to see me. Heathcliff said he did not consider my presence necessary, but as I had come, I might stay and arrange for the funeral, if I wished.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">07</span> 'The fool fastened the doors of the house against me yesterday, and spent the night drinking himself to death,' he said. 'Joseph and I broke in this morning. He was both dead and cold, so it was useless to go to further trouble about him.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">08</span> I insisted on the funeral being respectable. Heathcliff let me have my own way, but warned me to remember that the money for the whole affair came out of his pocket. His behaviour all through was hard and careless, showing neither joy nor sorrow. It expressed, if anything, a stony satisfaction at a difficult piece of work well done. I noticed once, indeed, something like self-congratulation in his face.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">09</span> It was when he was about to follow the coffin from the house. He lifted the unfortunate Hareton on to the table and murmured with peculiar pleasure, 'Now, my pretty boy, you are <em>mine</em>! We'll see if one tree won't grow as twisted as another, if it is at the mercy of the same wind!'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">10</span> The unsuspecting thing was pleased, and touched his cheek fondly, but I guessed the meaning of his words, and remarked, 'The boy must go back with me to Thrushcross Grange, sir.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">11</span> 'Does Linton say so?' he demanded.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">12</span> 'Of courseâ€”he has ordered me to take him.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">13</span> 'Well, you may tell your master that I have a fancy to try my skill at bringing up a young one, so if he attempts to remove this one, I must supply its place with my own.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">14</span> This threat to Isabella's child was enough to tie our hands. Edgar Linton, little interested at the beginning, spoke no more of interfering.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">15</span> The guest was now master of Wuthering Heights. He held firm possession, and proved to the lawyer that Hindley had mortgaged to him every yard of land he possessed, for money to supply his mad fondness for card playing.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">16</span> In that manner Hareton, who should now be the first gentleman in the district, was reduced to a state of complete dependence on his father's enemy, and lives in his own house as a servant without wages, unable to do anything to help himself because of his friendlessness, and his ignorance that he has been wronged.</p>
