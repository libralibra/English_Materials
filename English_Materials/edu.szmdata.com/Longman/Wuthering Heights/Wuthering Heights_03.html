<p class="chapter">Chapter 3</p>

<p class="storyTitle">No rooms for visitors</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">01</span> It seemed impossible that they should sit every day so unfriendly and silent. I thought, if I had caused the cloud, it was my duty to try to drive it away.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">02</span> 'Many could not imagine living in happiness so far from society,' I began, 'but you, Mr Heathcliff, with your wife and family&#160;...&#160;'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">03</span> 'My wife is no longer alive, sir.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">04</span> I realized that I had made a mistake. I looked at the young man.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">05</span> 'Mrs Heathcliff is my daughter-in-law.' As he spoke, Heathcliff turned a peculiar look of hate in her direction.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">06</span> 'And this young man&#160;...&#160;'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">07</span> 'Is not my son. My son is dead.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">08</span> The youth became red in the face.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">09</span> 'My name is Hareton Earnshaw,' he said roughly, 'and I advise you to respect it!'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">10</span> He fixed his eye on me in a threatening manner. I began to feel very much out of place in this strange family circle, and I determined to be cautious in risking my presence beneath its roof a third time.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">11</span> When the business of eating was over, I approached the window. Dark night was coming on, and sky and hills were hidden from sight by the wild turning movement of wind and snow.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">12</span> 'I don't think it possible for me to get home now without a guide,' I said.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">13</span> 'Hareton, drive those dozen sheep into shelter. They'll be covered if left out all night,' said Heathcliff, rising.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">14</span> 'What must I do?' I continued.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">15</span> There was no reply, and looking round I saw only Joseph bringing in the dogs' food, and Mrs Heathcliff leaning over the fire.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">16</span> 'Mrs Heathcliff,' I said earnestly, 'you must excuse me for troubling you. <em>Do</em> point out some landmarks by which I may know my way home.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">17</span> 'Take the road you came by,' she answered, settling herself in a chair with a book and a candle. 'I can't show you the way. They wouldn't let me go beyond the garden wall.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">18</span> 'Are there no boys at the farm?'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">19</span> 'No. There are only Heathcliff, Earnshaw, Zillah, Joseph and myself.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">20</span> 'I hope this will be a lesson to you, to make no more foolish journeys on these hills,' cried the voice of Heathcliff from the kitchen. 'As for staying here, I don't keep rooms for visitors. You must share a bed with Hareton or Joseph.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">21</span> 'I can sleep on a chair in this room.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">22</span> 'No! A stranger is a stranger, whether he be rich or poor. It will not suit me to have anyone wandering round this place when I am not on guard.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">23</span> With this insult, my patience was at an end. I pushed past him into the yard. It was so dark that I could not see the way out.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">24</span> Joseph was milking the cows by the light of a lamp. I seized it, and calling that I would send it back the next day, rushed to the nearest gate.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">25</span> 'Master, master, he's stealing the lamp!' shouted the old man. 'Hold him, dogs, hold him!'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">26</span> Two hairy animals sprang at my throat, bringing me to the ground and putting out the light, while rude laughter from Heathcliff and Hareton increased the force of my fury and humiliation. There I was forced to lie, till they called the dogs off.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">27</span> The violence of my anger started a bleeding of the nose. Heathcliff continued to laugh, and I continued to scold. At last Zillah, the big woman servant, came out to see what was happening.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">28</span> 'Are we going to murder people right on our doorstep? Look at that poor young gentlemanâ€”he can hardly breathe! Come in, and I'll cure that.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">29</span> With these words, she suddenly threw some icy water down my neck, and pulled me into the kitchen.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">30</span> I felt sick and faint. Heathcliff told Zillah to give me a glass of something strong to drink, after which I seemed a little better. I then allowed her to lead me to bed.</p>
