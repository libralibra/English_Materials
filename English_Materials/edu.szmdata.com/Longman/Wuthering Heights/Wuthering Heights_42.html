<p class="chapter">Chapter 42</p>

<p class="storyTitle">The trap</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">01</span> Seven days passed away, every one marking its passing by the rapid worsening of Edgar Linton's condition. We would have kept the truth from Cathy, but her own quick spirit guessed what was approaching. When Thursday came round, she could not bear to mention her ride. I did so, and obtained permission to order her out of doors, since her father's sick room had become her whole world, and she spent every moment by his side. Her face had become pale with watching and sorrow, and my master gladly sent her off to what he imagined to be a happy change of scene.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">02</span> He had a fixed idea that as his nephew was like him in appearance, he must be like him in mind, because Linton's letters, written, no doubt, under his father's eyes, gave few signs of his real character. Through pardonable weakness, I did not correct this belief, asking myself what good there would be in disturbing my master's last days with information he was powerless to use.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">03</span> Cathy's poor little heart was sad as we set out in the afternoon. Linton was waiting in the same place as before. There was more life in his manner of receiving us this time, but not the life of high spirits nor yet of joy. It looked to me more like fear.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">04</span> 'It's late,' he said, speaking sharply, and with difficulty. 'Is your father very ill? I thought you wouldn't come.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">05</span> Cathy's greeting froze on her lips.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">06</span> 'My father <em>is</em> very ill,' she said. 'Why didn't you send to free me from my promise, if you wished I wouldn't keep it? Come! I want an explanation. Playing and nonsense are completely driven out of my mind now; I've no time for pretence.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">07</span> Linton shivered, and looked at her, half ashamed.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">08</span> 'Pretence!' he said, in a low voice. 'Please, Cathy, don't look so angry. Scorn me as much as you please; I'm cowardly and worthless, but I'm too weak for your anger—hate my father, and let me off!'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">09</span> 'Nonsense!' cried Cathy, angrily. 'He's trembling, as if I were going to touch him! Get off! Let go of my dress!'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">10</span> With tears pouring down his face, Linton had thrown himself on the ground. He seemed helpless with terror.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">11</span> 'Oh!' he wept, 'I can't bear it! Cathy, I am behaving falsely to you, too, and I dare not tell you now! But leave me, and I shall be killed! Dear Cathy, my life is in your hands! You have said you loved me, so perhaps you <em>will</em> agree—and he'll let me die with you!'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">12</span> My young lady was thoroughly upset and alarmed. She bent to raise him up.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">13</span> 'Agree to what?' she asked. 'To stay? Tell me the meaning of this talk. Confess at once what is weighing on your heart. You wouldn't do me any harm, would you? You wouldn't let anyone hurt your best friend, if you could prevent it?'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">14</span> 'But my father threatened me,' cried the boy with difficulty. 'I dare <em>not</em> tell.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">15</span> 'Keep your secret, then,' said Cathy, with scornful pity. 'Save yourself; I'm not afraid.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">16</span> I heard a movement among the heather, and saw Heathcliff close upon us. He didn't look at my companions, but calling to me in an almost friendly way, said:</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">17</span> 'It is something to see you so near my house, Nelly. How are they at the Grange?' he added, in a lower voice. 'It is said that Edgar Linton is on his deathbed: perhaps that's not true?'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">18</span> 'No, my master is dying,' I replied. 'It is true enough.' </p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">19</span> 'How long will he last, do you think?' he asked.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">20</span> 'I don't know.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">21</span> 'Because,' he continued, looking at the two young people, 'that boy seems determined to defeat me. I'd thank his uncle to be quick and go before him.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">22</span> 'I should say,' I remarked, 'that instead of wandering on the hills, he ought to be in bed, in the care of a doctor.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">23</span> 'Get up, Linton!' he shouted. 'Don't twist about on the ground, there—up, this moment!'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">24</span> Linton had sunk down again, in helpless fear, when his father looked at him. He tried several times to obey, but his strength failed him.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">25</span> 'I will, Papa,' he said breathlessly. 'Only let me alone. I've done as you wished, I'm sure. Ah! Keep by me, Cathy. Give me your hand.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">26</span> 'Take mine,' said his father, 'and stand on your feet. There, now. You would imagine I was cruel to him, Miss Cathy, to excite such terror. Be so kind as to walk home with him: he trembles if I touch him.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">27</span> 'I can't go to Wuthering Heights,' said Cathy. 'Papa has forbidden it. Linton, dear, your father won't harm you. Why are you so afraid?'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">28</span> 'Very well,' answered Heathcliff, 'we'll respect Cathy's decision. Come then, my brave boy! Are you willing to return in my company?'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">29</span> He made a movement to seize the boy, but Linton, drawing back, held on to his cousin, and begged her in such a despairing manner to go with him, that she could not refuse him. What frightened him, we could not imagine. We reached the door. Cathy walked in, and I stood waiting till she led the sick boy to a chair, expecting her to come out again at once.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">30</span> Mr Heathcliff pushed me forward, made me sit down, and then turned and locked the door.</p>
