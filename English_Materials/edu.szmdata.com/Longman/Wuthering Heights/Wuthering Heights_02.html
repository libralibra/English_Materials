<p class="chapter">Chapter 2</p>

<p class="storyTitle">Less welcome still</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">01</span> Yesterday afternoon was misty and cold. I nearly decided to spend it by my sitting room fire, but on coming up from dinner I found the servant still trying to light it. I took my hat, and after a four miles' walk, arrived at Heathcliff's garden gate just in time to escape the first light feathers of a shower of snow.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">02</span> On that cold hilltop, the earth was frozen hard, and the air made me shiver. I knocked in vain on the front door, and the dogs began to make a noise.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">03</span> I knocked a second time. The head of unfriendly Joseph appeared out of a round window of the storehouse.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">04</span> 'What do you want?' he shouted. 'The master's down at the farm.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">05</span> 'Is there nobody to open the door?' I called.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">06</span> 'There's only the mistress, and she won't open, if you shout till night time.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">07</span> 'Why? Can't you tell her who I am?'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">08</span> 'It's not my business.' His head disappeared.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">09</span> The snow began to fall thickly. I was about to knock a third time, when a young man without a coat and carrying a spade came from the yard behind. He called to me to follow him, and after marching through a wash-house, and an area containing a coal-house, a pump and a pigeon-house, we at last arrived in the huge, warm, cheerful room in which I was received before.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">10</span> An immense fire was burning, and near the table, which was laid for a plentiful evening meal, I was pleased to see the 'mistress'.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">11</span> I bowed and waited, thinking she would ask me to take a seat. She looked at me, leaning back in her chair, and remained silent and motionless.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">12</span> 'It's rough weather,' I remarked. 'I had hard work, Mrs Heathcliff, to make your servant hear me.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">13</span> She never opened her mouth, but kept her eyes on me in a cool manner, extremely disagreeable.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">14</span> 'Sit down,' said the young man roughly. 'He'll be in soon.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">15</span> I obeyed.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">16</span> One of the dogs now came up in a more friendly manner than the first time.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">17</span> 'A beautiful animal,' I began again. 'Do you intend to keep the little ones, Mrs Heathcliff?'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">18</span> 'They are not mine,' said my hostess, more rudely than Heathcliff himself.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">19</span> I repeated my remark on the wildness of the weather.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">20</span> 'You shouldn't have come out,' said the lady, rising and reaching two painted tea tins from the shelf above the fireplace.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">21</span> Her position, before, had been sheltered from the light. Now, I had a clear view of her whole face and figure. She seemed little more than a girl, with an admirable form, and the most delicate little face that I had ever had the pleasure of seeing.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">22</span> The tins were almost out of her reach. I made a movement to assist her. She turned on me.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">23</span> 'I don't want your help,' she said sharply.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">24</span> I hastily begged her pardon.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">25</span> 'Were you asked to tea?' she demanded, standing with a spoonful of tea held over the pot.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">26</span> 'No,' I said, half smiling. 'You are the proper person to ask me.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">27</span> She threw the tea back, spoon and all, and returned to her chair. Her under-lip was pushed out, like a child's, ready to cry.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">28</span> Meanwhile the young man had put on some sort of a jacket, and, standing before the fire, was looking down on me fiercely. I began to doubt his being a servant. Both his dress and his speech were rough, his hair uncut, and his hands as brown as a farm worker's; still, his manner was free, almost proud, and he showed no sign of waiting on the lady of the house.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">29</span> Five minutes later, Heathcliff arrived.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">30</span> 'I wonder that you should choose the thick of a snowstorm to walk out in,' he said, shaking the white powder from his clothes. 'Do you know you run a risk of being lost? Even people familiar with these moors often miss their way on an evening like this.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">31</span> 'Perhaps I can get a guide from among your boys? Could you spare me one?'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">32</span> 'No, I could not.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">33</span> 'Are you going to make the tea?' asked the young man, looking at the lady.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">34</span> 'Is <em>he</em> to have any?' she asked, turning to Heathcliff.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">35</span> 'Get it ready, will you?' was the answer, so fiercely spoken that I moved in surprise.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">36</span> When the preparations were completed, he invited me with:</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">37</span> 'Now, sir, bring forward your chair.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">38</span> We all drew round the table, and the meal began without further speech.</p>
