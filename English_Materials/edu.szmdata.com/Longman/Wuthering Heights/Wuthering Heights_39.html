<p class="chapter">Chapter 39</p>

<p class="storyTitle">Linton is difficult</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">01</span> The rainy night was followed by a misty morning, and the rushing streams from the hills crossed our path. My feet were thoroughly wetted, and I felt disagreeable and unwell. We entered the farmhouse by the kitchen way, to be sure that Heathcliff was really absent.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">02</span> Joseph was sitting alone, enjoying himself in front of a huge fire, with his pipe in his mouth. He answered our questions very unwillingly.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">03</span> 'Joseph!' cried a babyish voice from the inner room. 'How often am I to call you? There are only a few red ashes left.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">04</span> Joseph took no notice. The housekeeper and Hareton were not to be seen, both probably at their work elsewhere. We recognized Linton's voice and entered.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">05</span> His cousin flew to his side.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">06</span> 'Is that you, Miss Linton?' he said, raising his head from the arm of the great chair in which he was lying. 'Will you shut the door, please? You left it open, and those hateful people won't bring coal for the fire. It's so cold!'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">07</span> I attended to the fire, and fetched some coal myself. The sick boy complained of being covered in ashes, but he had a bad cough, and looked feverish and ill, so I did not blame him.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">08</span> 'Well, Linton,' said Cathy, 'are you glad to see me?'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">09</span> 'Why didn't you come before?' was his reply. 'You should have come, instead of writing. It tired me horribly, writing those long letters. Now I can neither bear to talk, nor anything else. I wonder where Zillah is! Will you'—looking at me—'step into the kitchen and see?'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">10</span> I had received no thanks for my other service, so I remained where I was, replying, 'There is no one there except Joseph.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">11</span> 'I want to drink,' he exclaimed, turning away. 'Zillah is always going off to Gimmerton since Papa left. And I'm forced to come down here—they pretend not to hear me upstairs.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">12</span> Cathy began searching for some water. She filled a glass, and brought it. He told her to add a spoonful of wine from a bottle on the table, and having swallowed a little, seemed better, and said she was very kind.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">13</span> 'Are you glad to see me?' repeated Cathy, pleased that he was smiling faintly.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">14</span> 'Yes, I am,' he replied. 'But I have been annoyed that you wouldn't come before. And Papa swore it was my fault He called me a worthless thing, and said if he had been in my place, he would be more master of the Grange than your father, by this time.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">15</span> 'I dare not come while your father is here,' said Cathy. 'If I could get my father's permission, I'd spend half my time with you. I wish you were my brother!'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">16</span> 'And then you would like me as well as your father?' he remarked, more cheerfully. 'But Papa says you would love me better than anyone else, if you were my wife.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">17</span> 'People hate their wives sometimes,' said Cathy, 'but not their brothers and sisters.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">18</span> Linton declared that people never hated their wives, but Cathy repeated that they did, and gave as an example, his own father's dislike of her aunt. I tried to stop her thoughtless tongue, but everything she knew came out.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">19</span> Linton declared that her story was false.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">20</span> 'Papa told me, and he does not tell untruths,' she answered.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">21</span> 'My Papa scorns yours!' cried Linton.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">22</span> 'And yours is a wicked man!' replied Cathy.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">23</span> 'Well, I'll tell <em>you</em> something,' said Linton. 'Your mother hated your father: now then!'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">24</span> 'Oh!' exclaimed Cathy, too furious to continue.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">25</span> 'And she loved mine!' he added.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">26</span> 'It's not true!' she shouted. 'I hate you now.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">27</span> 'She did! She did!' sang Linton, sinking back to enjoy the unhappiness of his companion, who stood behind.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">28</span> Cathy, losing control of herself, gave the chair a violent push, and caused him to fall against one arm. He was immediately seized with a cough that stopped his breath and soon ended his moment of victory. It lasted so long that it frightened even me. As to his cousin, she wept violently, though she said nothing. I held him till the attack ended. Then he pushed me away, and leant his head down silently. Cathy took a seat opposite, and looked into the fire.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">29</span> 'How do you feel now, Master Heathcliff?' I asked after about ten minutes.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">30</span> 'I wish she felt as I do!' he replied, 'Cruel, unkind thing!'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">31</span> He continued to groan for a quarter of an hour.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">32</span> 'I'm sorry I hurt you, Linton,' his cousin said at last. 'But I shouldn't have been hurt by that little push, and I didn't imagine that you would have been. It wasn't much, was it?'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">33</span> 'I can't speak to you,' he murmured. 'You've hurt me so much that I shall lie awake all night with this cough.' And he began to weep.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">34</span> 'Must I go then?' asked Cathy sadly.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">35</span> 'Let me alone.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">36</span> She waited a long time. He neither looked up nor spoke. At last she made a movement to the door, and I followed. We were brought back by a scream. Linton had slid from his seat on to the floor, and lay twisting himself about, determined to be as annoying as possible. Cathy knelt down and cried.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">37</span> 'I shall lift him up on to the bench,' I said, 'and he may roll about as much as he pleases. We can't stop to watch him. I hope you are satisfied, Miss Cathy, that you are not the person to improve his health.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">38</span> She placed a cushion under his head, and offered him water. He refused the drink, and complained that the cushion was too high. He would not let her leave him. She sang him a number of songs, and so they went on, till the clock struck twelve.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">39</span> 'And tomorrow, Cathy, will you be here tomorrow?' Linton asked, holding her dress as she rose to go.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">40</span> She whispered in his ear, and at last we left.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">41</span> 'You won't go tomorrow, Miss?' I began, as soon as we were out of the house.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">42</span> She smiled.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">43</span> 'I'll take good care,' I continued. 'I'll have that lock mended.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">44</span> 'I can get over the wall,' she said, laughing. 'The Grange isn't a prison, and besides, I'm almost seventeen. I'm certain Linton would recover more quickly if he had me to look after him.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">45</span> 'Listen, Miss,' I replied. 'If you attempt going to Wuthering Heights again, I shall inform Mr Linton.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">46</span> We reached home before our dinner time. My master asked no explanation of our absence. He thought we had been wandering in the park. As soon as I entered, I hastened to change my wet shoes and stockings, but sitting such a long time at the Heights had done me harm, and the next morning I was ill. For three weeks I was in bed, unable to carry out my duties.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">47</span> My little mistress behaved like a saint in coming to wait on me, and cheer my loneliness. The moment she left her father's room, she appeared at my bedside. Her day was divided between us. She neglected her meals, her study and her play.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">48</span> It is true that my master went to sleep early, and I generally needed nothing after six o'clock. I never considered what she did with herself after tea. And though frequently, when she looked in to say goodnight, I noticed a fresh colour in her cheeks, instead of thinking it the result of a cold ride on the moors, I imagined it was from a hot fire in the library.</p>
