<p class="storyTitle">Chapter 18 House-party</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">1</span> Mr Rochester had been absent for more than two weeks, when Mrs Fairfax received a letter from him.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">2</span> While she opened the envelope and read, I went on taking my coffee. My hand shook, and I spilt half the liquid from my cup into my saucer.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">3</span> 'Well, I sometimes think we are too quiet, but now we are to be busy enough for a little time at least,' she declared. 'Mr Rochester will be here in three days' time, and a great many fine people are coming with him. He sends orders for the whole house to be prepared.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">4</span> Mrs Fairfax finished her breakfast, and hastened away to begin operations.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">5</span> The next three days were indeed busy ones. I never saw such washing, brushing, beating of carpets, polishing of glasses, taking down and putting up of pictures. Adèle ran quite wild in the middle of it, dancing about the house, and looking over her dresses. She was excused from school duties. Mrs Fairfax asked for my help, and I was all day in the storeroom helping her and the cook. I had no time for dark thoughts, and I was as active and gay as anyone. Only when I chanced to see the third storey staircase door open and Grace Poole come down, as was her custom, to eat her dinner in the kitchen, did I lose my cheerfulness.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">6</span> The strangest thing of all was that no one in the house, except me, seemed to notice her habits, or wonder about them. No one discussed her position or employment. I did, indeed, once by accident hear part of a conversation on the subject, between two of the servants.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">7</span> 'She gets good wages, I suppose?'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">8</span> 'Yes, I wish I had as good. Not that I complain of mine, but they're not one-fifth the sum that Mrs Poole receives.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">9</span> 'She's good at her work, I expect.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">10</span> 'Ah! She understands what she has to do. Not everyone could do her job.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">11</span> 'That's true! I wonder whether the master&#160;...&#160;'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">12</span> At that moment, one of them noticed me, and made a sign to her companion to be careful.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">13</span> 'Doesn't she know?' I heard the other whisper.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">14</span> The first one shook her head, and they both became silent.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">15</span> The three days passed, and on the afternoon of the fourth day, Mrs Fairfax dressed herself in her best black silk dress, and put on her gold watch, as it was her business to receive the company, show the ladies to their rooms, and so on.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">16</span> At last wheels were heard. Four riders came rapidly up the avenue, followed by two carriages. Two of the riders were young gentlemen, the third was Mr Rochester, and the fourth, who rode by his side, was a lady.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">17</span> 'Miss Ingram!' exclaimed Mrs Fairfax, and she hurried away to her place below.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">18</span> A joyful movement was now heard in the hall. Gentlemen's deep voices and ladies' silvery notes sounded together. Clear above all, though not so loud, was the voice of the master of Thornfield Hall welcoming his guests.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">19</span> Adèle begged to go down, and I had difficulty in making her understand that in no case must she do so, unless she was sent for. I told her stories as long as she would listen to them, then, for a change, took her out to look down the stairs and watch the servants passing backwards and forwards with a meal. When the evening was far advanced, there was a sound of music from the drawing room, followed by conversation. I listened long. Suddenly I discovered that I was trying to catch the voice of my master, and to understand what he was saying.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">20</span> The next day, Mrs Fairfax said to me:</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">21</span> 'I happened to remark to Mr Rochester how much Adèle wished to be introduced to the ladies, and he said: "Oh, let her come to the drawing room after dinner, and request Miss Eyre to come with her."'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">22</span> 'He said that from mere politeness. I need not go, I am sure.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">23</span> 'Well, I remarked to him that you were unused to society and would not like appearing in such a gay gathering, and he replied, in his quick way: "Nonsense! If she objects, tell her it is my particular wish; and if she resists, say that I shall come and fetch her."'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">24</span> 'I will not give him that trouble. Will you be there, Mrs Fairfax?'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">25</span> 'No, I begged to be excused. I'll tell you how to avoid the awkwardness of a formal entrance. You must go into the drawing room while it is empty, before the ladies leave the dinner table. Choose your seat in any quiet corner. You need not stay long after the gentlemen come in. Just let Mr Rochester see that you are there, and then slip away. Nobody will notice you.'</p>
