<p class="storyTitle">Chapter 36 Heiress</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">1</span> When St John went, it was beginning to snow. The storm continued all night. An icy wind the next day brought fresh falls, and by evening it was almost impossible to move out of doors. My astonishment, therefore, was very great when the door suddenly opened and St John Rivers appeared, his tall figure almost covered with snow.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">2</span> 'Is there any bad news?' I asked. 'Has anything happened?'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">3</span> 'No. How very easily you are alarmed!' he answered, removing his coat and shaking the snow from his boots. 'I am spoiling your clean floor, but you must excuse me for once.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">4</span> 'But why have you come?'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">5</span> 'Rather an awkward question to put to a visitor. I merely wished to have a talk with you. Since yesterday I have been experiencing the excitement of a person to whom a story has been half told, and who is impatient to hear its ending.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">6</span> He sat down, and I waited, but he seemed occupied with his thoughts. I went on with the reading which his entrance had interrupted. In a little while he took a letter from his pocket, looked at it in silence, and at last spoke.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">7</span> 'Leave your book a moment, and come a little nearer to the fire.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">8</span> Wondering, I obeyed.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">9</span> 'A little while ago,' he went on, 'I spoke of a half-finished story. I am going to repeat it to you. It is only fair to warn you that some of it will sound familiar.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">10</span> 'Twenty years ago, a poor priest&#151;never mind his name&#151;loved a rich man's daughter. She returned his love, and married him against the advice of all her friends. Before two years had passed, both were dead. They left a daughter, a friendless thing, unwillingly brought up by an aunt called Mrs Reed, of Gateshead. You move&#151;did you hear a noise? The orphan passed at the age of ten to a place you know&#151;Lowood School, where she left an honourable record as a pupil and a teacher. She became a governess at the house of a certain Mr Rochester.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">11</span> 'Mr Rivers!' I interrupted.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">12</span> 'I have nearly finished. I know nothing of Mr Rochester, except that he pretended to offer honourable marriage to this young girl, and that at the last moment she found out that he had a wife still alive, though a madwoman. Soon after, an event happened which made inquiry after the governess necessary. It was then discovered that she had gone&#151;no one could tell when, where, or how. All search after her was in vain. Yet it has become a matter of urgency that she should be found. Advertisements have been put in all the newspapers. I myself received a letter from a certain Mr Briggs, a lawyer, giving me these details.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">13</span> 'But tell me,' I said. 'What about Mr Rochester? Is he well?'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">14</span> 'I have no knowledge of anything concerning Mr Rochester, except for his attempt to deceive the law.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">15</span> 'But these people wrote to him?'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">16</span> 'Mr Briggs states that the answer to his application for information was signed by a lady: Alice Fairfax. This Mr Rochester must have been a bad man,' remarked Mr Rivers.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">17</span> 'You don't know him. Don't give an opinion on him,' I said.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">18</span> St John took from his pocket a strip of paper marked with paint stains. I read on it, in my own handwriting, the words 'Jane Eyre', no doubt written in some careless moment.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">19</span> 'Briggs wrote to me of a Jane Eyre,' he said, 'and the advertisements demanded someone of that name. I knew a Jane Elliott, and I had my suspicions. This piece of paper told me the truth yesterday. You admit to your real name?'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">20</span> 'Yes, but where is Mr Briggs? Perhaps he knows more of Mr Rochester than you do.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">21</span> 'Mr Briggs is in London, but I doubt whether he is interested in Mr Rochester. You do not inquire why he is interested in <em>you</em>&#151;why he is searching for you?'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">22</span> 'Well, what did he want?'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">23</span> 'Merely to tell you that your uncle, Mr Eyre of Madeira, is dead, that he has left you all his property, and that you are now rich&#151;merely that&#151;nothing more.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">24</span> 'I! Rich?'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">25</span> 'Yes, quite an heiress.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">26</span> There was silence.</p>
