<p class="storyTitle">Chapter 10 The death of Helen</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">1</span> As spring advanced, the discomforts of Lowood lessened. The nights were not so bitterly cold, the snows melted, the sharp winds became milder. We could now enjoy the play-hour passed in the garden. On Thursday afternoons (half-holidays) we now went for walks, and I learnt for the first time to take pleasure in fine scenery, in the hills that enclosed our wooded valley. Trees, flowers, and the rushing streams, all delighted me.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">2</span> But although the neighbourhood was pleasant, it was unhealthy. Before May arrived, a fever had attacked the crowded schoolroom and turned the orphanage into a hospital.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">3</span> Too little food, and neglected colds, made most of the pupils tend to catch the disease easily. Forty-five out of the eighty girls lay ill at one time. Classes were broken up, rules were forgotten. The few who remained well were allowed almost unlimited freedom, because the doctor insisted on the necessity of frequent exercise to keep them in health. Miss Temple's whole attention was taken up by the sick. The teachers were fully occupied in helping the girls who were fortunate enough to have friends and relations willing to remove them from danger, to pack and leave. Many left only to die.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">4</span> But I, and the rest who continued well, did what we liked and went where we liked. Mr Brocklehurst and his family never came near Lowood now. We lived for whole days out of doors.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">5</span> And where, meanwhile, was Helen Burns? She was ill. For some weeks she had been removed from my sight to some room upstairs. She was not, I was told, in the same part of the house as the fever patients, as her illness was a disease of the lungs. This, I wrongly believed, was something mild which time and care would be sure to cure. The idea was strengthened by the fact that she once or twice came downstairs on very warm sunny afternoons, and was taken by Miss Temple into the garden, but I was not allowed to go and speak to her.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">6</span> One evening the doctor appeared at an unusual hour, a sign that someone was very ill. I was near the front door when he left, and I ran up to the nurse who had been speaking to him.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">7</span> 'How is Helen Burns?'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">8</span> 'Very weak,' was the answer.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">9</span> 'What does the doctor say about her?'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">10</span> 'He says she'll not be here long.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">11</span> At ordinary times I should have taken this sentence to mean merely that Helen was going to her own home. I should not have suspected that it meant that she was dying, but I knew instantly now. I experienced a shock of horror, then a strong feeling of sorrow, and then a desire, a need to see her. I asked in which room she lay.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">12</span> 'She is in Miss Temple's room,' said the nurse.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">13</span> 'May I go and speak to her?'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">14</span> 'No, child.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">15</span> It was just nine o'clock, and Miss Miller was calling the pupils to go to bed. I went with the rest.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">16</span> Two hours later, I rose softly and crept without shoes in search of Miss Temple's room. It was at the other end of the house, but I knew my way. I passed quickly by the fever room, fearing that the nurse who sat up all night might hear me.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">17</span> Close by Miss Temple's bed, stood a smaller one. I saw the shape of a body under the bed clothes. The nurse to whom I had spoken in the garden was sitting in a chair asleep. Miss Temple was not to be seen. I learnt afterwards that she had been called to the bedside of another patient. I approached.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">18</span> 'Helen!' I whispered softly. 'Are you awake?'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">19</span> She moved slightly, and I saw her calm, pale face.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">20</span> 'Is it you, Jane?' she asked, in her own gentle voice.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">21</span> 'Oh!' I thought. 'She is not going to die. They are mistaken. She could not speak and look so calmly if she were.' </p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">22</span> 'Why have you come here, Jane? It is past eleven o'clock. I heard the clock strike a few minutes ago.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">23</span> 'I came to see you, Helen. I heard you were very ill, and I could not sleep until I had spoken to you.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">24</span> 'You came to say goodbye to me, then. You are just in time, probably.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">25</span> 'Are you going somewhere, Helen?'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">26</span> 'Yes, to my last home.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">27</span> 'No, no, Helen!' I stopped, in despair. While I tried to keep back my tears, Helen began to cough. After a long silence, she whispered:</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">28</span> 'I am very happy, Jane, and when you hear them say that I am dead, you must not be sad. We must all die one day, and the illness which is removing me is gentle and gradual. My mind is at rest. I leave no one to regret me much. I have only a father, and he has lately re-married, and will not miss me. I am going to God.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">29</span> In a little while she added:</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">30</span> 'How comfortable I am! That last attack of coughing has tired me a little. I feel as if I could sleep. Don't leave me, Jane. I like you to be near me.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">31</span> 'I'll stay with you, dear Helen. No one shall take me away.' I lay down beside her. She kissed me, and we both soon slept.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">32</span> When I awoke, it was day, and Helen was&#160;... dead.</p>
