<p class="storyTitle">Chapter 24 News from Gateshead</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">1</span> On the afternoon of this same day, I was called downstairs by a message that someone wanted me in Mrs Fairfax's room. There I found a man having the appearance of a gentleman's servant, and dressed in black.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">2</span> 'I expect you hardly remember me, miss,' he said, rising as I entered, 'but I was coachman with Mrs Reed when you were at Gateshead, and I live there still.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">3</span> 'Oh, how do you do? I remember you very well. And how is Bessie? You are married to Bessie, aren't you?'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">4</span> 'Yes, my wife is very well, thank you.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">5</span> 'And are the family well at the house?'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">6</span> 'I am sorry I can't give you better news of them, miss. Mr John died a week ago in London.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">7</span> 'Mr John?'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">8</span> 'Yes. His life was very wild. He got into debt and into prison; his mother helped him out twice, but the third time she refused, and the next news was that he was dead. They say he killed himself.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">9</span> I was silent. The news was terrible. The coachman went on:</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">10</span> 'Missis had been in poor health herself for some time. The loss of money and fear of poverty were troubling her. The shock of Mr John's death was too sudden. She fell ill, and remained for three days without speaking, but last Tuesday she seemed rather better, and kept making signs to Bessie and murmuring. At last my wife understood the words, "Bring Jane Eyre. I want to speak to her." She told Miss Eliza and Miss Georgiana and advised them to send for you, and at last they agreed. If you can get ready, miss, I should like to take you back with me early tomorrow morning.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">11</span> 'Yes, I shall be ready. It seems to me that I ought to go.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">12</span> Having directed him to the servants' hall, I went in search of Mr Rochester. He was entertaining some of his guests. It needed some courage to disturb the party, but my business was urgent. I approached my master where he stood by Miss Ingram's side. She turned as I came near, and when I said in a low voice, 'Mr Rochester', she made a movement, as if tempted to order me away.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">13</span> Mr Rochester followed me out of the room.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">14</span> 'Well, Jane?' he said, as he rested his back against the schoolroom door, which he had shut.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">15</span> 'If you please, sir, I want permission to be absent for a week or two.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">16</span> 'What for? Where are you going?'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">17</span> 'To see a sick lady, my uncle's wife, at Gateshead. She has sent for me.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">18</span> 'And what good can you do her? Nonsense, Jane! I would never think of running hundreds of miles to see someone who will probably be dead before you reach her.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">19</span> 'I cannot be easy in my mind if I neglect her wishes.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">20</span> 'Promise me only to stay a week&#160;...&#160;'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">21</span> 'I had better not give my word. I might be forced to break it.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">22</span> 'But you <em>will</em> come back? You will not be persuaded to remain permanently with her?'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">23</span> 'Oh, no! I shall certainly return if all is well.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">24</span> 'Well, you must have some money. I have given you no salary yet. How much have you in the world, Jane?'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">25</span> I took out my purse.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">26</span> 'Five shillings, sir.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">27</span> He laughed, and searched his pockets.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">28</span> 'Here,' he said, offering me fifty pounds in notes. I told him I had no change.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">29</span> 'I don't want change: you know that. Take your wages.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">30</span> I refused to accept more than was due to me. He owed me only fifteen.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">31</span> He looked angry at first. Then, as if remembering something, he said:</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">32</span> 'Right! Right! Better not to give you all now. You would, perhaps, stay away three months. There are ten pounds: that's plenty, isn't it?'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">33</span> 'Yes, sir, but you now owe me five.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">34</span> 'Come back for it.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">35</span> 'Mr Rochester, I may as well mention another matter of business to you while I have the opportunity.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">36</span> 'Matter of business? I am curious to hear it.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">37</span> 'You have informed me, sir, that you are shortly to be married. In that case, sir, Adèle ought to go to school.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">38</span> 'To get her out of my bride's way? And you?'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">39</span> 'I must find other employment somewhere. I must advertise.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">40</span> 'Of course!' he exclaimed, with a sharpness of voice and a twisting of his features unusual to him. 'You dare to advertise! I wish I had only offered you a pound instead of ten. Give me back nine pounds, Jane, I've a use for it.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">41</span> 'And so have I, sir,' I replied, putting my hands and my purse behind me.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">42</span> 'Ungenerous little thing!' he said. 'Give me five pounds, Jane.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">43</span> 'Not five shillings, sir, nor five pence.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">44</span> 'Just let me look at the money.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">45</span> 'No, sir, you are not to be trusted.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">46</span> 'Jane!'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">47</span> 'Sir?'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">48</span> 'Promise me not to advertise, and to leave the finding of your employment to me.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">49</span> 'I shall be glad to do so, sir, if you, in your turn, will promise me that Adèle and I shall both be safely out of the house before your bride enters it.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">50</span> 'Very well! You go tomorrow, then?'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">51</span> 'Yes, sir, early.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">52</span> 'Then you and I must say goodbye for a little while?'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">53</span> 'I suppose so, sir.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">54</span> 'And how do people perform that ceremony of parting? Teach me, Jane.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">55</span> 'They say, "Goodbye", or any other form that they prefer.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">56</span> 'Then say it.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">57</span> 'Goodbye, Mr Rochester, for the present.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">58</span> 'It seems dry to me, and unfriendly. I should like something else. If one shook hands, for instance; but no&#151;that would not content me either.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">59</span> 'How long is he going to stand with his back against that door?' I asked myself. 'I want to begin packing.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">60</span> The dinner bell rang, and he rushed away without another word.</p>
