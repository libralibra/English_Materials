<p class="storyTitle">Chapter 7 Helen Burns</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">1</span> The next day began as before, with getting up and dressing before sunrise, but this morning it was so cold that we were unable to wash, as the water in the jugs was frozen.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">2</span> Before the long hour of Bible-reading was over, I thought I should die of cold. Breakfast time came at last, and this morning the porridge was not burnt. The quality was eatable, but the quantity small. How tiny my share seemed! I wished that it were doubled!</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">3</span> In the course of the day, I began to work as a member of the fourth class. At first, as I had not been used to learning by heart, the lessons seemed to me both long and difficult. The frequent change from one subject to another also confused me, and I was glad when at about three o'clock in the afternoon Miss Smith put some sewing into my hands and sent me to a quiet corner of the schoolroom. At that hour, most of the others were also sewing, but one class still stood round a teacher reading, and as all was quiet, the subject of their lesson could be heard, together with the answers of the pupils, and the remarks of the teacher. It was history, and I observed my companion of the day before at the top of the class, until for some mistake she was sent right to the bottom. Even then, she was continually scolded in such words as these:</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">4</span> 'Burns (such was her name: the girls here were all called by their family names)&#151;you are standing on the side of your shoe. Turn your toes out immediately.'&#160;... 'Burns, hold your head up.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">5</span> When a chapter had been read through twice, the books were closed and the girls examined. Most of them seemed to find it difficult, but Burns was ready with answers on every point. I kept expecting the teacher, Miss Scatcherd, to praise her, but instead she suddenly cried out:</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">6</span> 'You dirty, unpleasant girl! You have not cleaned your nails this morning!'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">7</span> Burns made no answer. I was surprised at her silence.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">8</span> 'Why,' I thought, 'does she not explain that the water was frozen this morning?'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">9</span> My attention was now called for by Miss Smith, who wanted to look at my work. When I returned to my seat, Burns was just leaving the room in obedience to some order from Miss Scatcherd. She returned in half a minute carrying in her hand a bundle of sticks tied together at one end. This she presented respectfully to the teacher. Miss Scatcherd instantly and sharply struck a dozen blows on her neck. Not one tear rose in Burns's eye, and while I paused from my sewing, because my fingers trembled with anger at this scene, not one feature of her thoughtful face changed its expression.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">10</span> During the play-hour that evening, I made my way to the fireplace. There, kneeling by it, I found Burns, her attention fixed on a book.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">11</span> 'Is that the same one as yesterday?' I asked.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">12</span> 'Yes, I have just finished it.' She shut it up.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">13</span> 'What is your name besides Burns?'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">14</span> 'Helen.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">15</span> 'Do you come from far away, Helen?'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">16</span> 'I come from a place farther north, on the borders of Scotland.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">17</span> 'You must wish to leave Lowood.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">18</span> 'No, why should I? I was sent here to get an education, and it would be no use going away before I had done so.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">19</span> 'But that teacher, Miss Scatcherd, is so cruel to you.' </p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">20</span> 'Cruel? Not at all! She is severe. She dislikes my faults.' </p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">21</span> 'If I were in your place, and she struck me, I should get the stick from her hand, and break it under her nose.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">22</span> 'If you did, Mr Brocklehurst would send you away from the school, and that would be a great grief to your relations.' </p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">23</span> 'But it seems to me disgraceful to be beaten in front of everyone. I could not bear it.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">24</span> 'It is weak and silly to say that you cannot bear what it is necessary for you to bear.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">25</span> I heard her with wonder. I could not understand her point of view.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">26</span> 'You say you have faults, Helen. What are they? To me you seem very good.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">27</span> 'I am, as Miss Scatcherd says, careless and untidy. I seldom keep things in order. I forget rules. I read when I ought to be learning my lessons.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">28</span> 'Is Miss Temple as severe with you as Miss Scatcherd?'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">29</span> A soft smile came over her face.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">30</span> 'Miss Temple is full of goodness. She sees my faults, and tells me them gently. When I do anything well, she praises me generously.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">31</span> 'And when Miss Temple teaches you, do your thoughts wander?'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">32</span> 'No, not often, because what she says is generally so interesting to me.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">33</span> 'You are good to those who are good to you. That is all I ever desire to be. But when we are struck without a reason, we should strike back very hard.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">34</span> 'It is not violence that best conquers hate. The good try to love their enemies, and bless those that curse them.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">35</span> 'Then I ought to love Mrs Reed, and bless her son John, which is impossible.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">36</span> In her turn, Helen asked me to explain, and I poured out the story of my past sufferings. She heard me patiently to the end, but said nothing.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">37</span> 'Well,' I asked, 'is not Mrs Reed a bad, hard-hearted woman?'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">38</span> 'She has been unkind to you, no doubt, but wouldn't you be happier if you tried to forget her severity? Life appears to me to be too short to be spent in remembering past injustices.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">39</span> I saw by Helen's look that she no longer wished to talk, but rather to be left with her thoughts. This, however, was not permitted for long. A great rough girl came up, exclaiming:</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">40</span> 'Helen Burns, if you don't go and put your drawer tidy at once, I'll tell Miss Scatcherd to come and look at it!'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">41</span> Helen got up and obeyed without delay.</p>
