<p class="storyTitle">Chapter 14 In the lane</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">1</span> The untroubled life which my first calm introduction to Thornfield seemed to promise, became a reality. Mrs Fairfax remained kind and friendly. My pupil was an active, restless child, rather spoilt, but she soon became obedient and willing to learn, and made progress.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">2</span> October, November, December, passed away. On one afternoon in January, Adèle was given a holiday because she had a cold. It was a fine, calm day. Mrs Fairfax had just written a letter which was waiting to be posted, so I offered to carry it to the village, two miles away.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">3</span> The ground was frozen hard. The air was still, my road was lonely. I walked fast till I became warm, then slowly to enjoy the pleasure of the hour and of the country scene. The lane sloped uphill. Having walked about halfway, I sat down on a stile which led to a field. From my seat I could look down on Thornfield, whose woods rose against the west. The sun went down as I watched, and I turned eastward.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">4</span> On the hilltop above me sat the rising moon, pale yet as a cloud, but brightening from one moment to the next. In the unbroken silence I could plainly hear faint sounds of life in the distant village. I could hear, too, the flow of many little streams in the hills and valleys.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">5</span> A loud noise broke in on these murmurings: a sound of heavy steps on the bridge. A horse was coming: the winding lane still hid it, but it approached. I was just leaving the stile but as the path was narrow, I sat still to let the horse go by. All sorts of fancies, bright and dark, came into my mind: the memory of nursery stories was there among others. As the horse approached, I remembered some of Bessie's stories of a ghost which took the form of a horse or dog, and was seen in lonely places.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">6</span> The horse was very near, but not yet in sight, when, in addition to the noise of its feet, I heard a rush under the hedge, and a great dog ran by, whose black and white coat was clearly to be seen. It was a lion-like creature with long hair and a huge head. The horse followed&#151;a tall animal with a rider on its back. He passed, and I went on a few steps, then I turned. A sliding sound, and a sudden fall, attracted my attention. Man and horse were down. They had slipped on a sheet of ice. The dog came running back, and seeing his master in difficulty, barked loudly and then ran up to me for help. I walked down to the traveller, who was by this time struggling to free himself from his horse.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">7</span> 'Are you hurt, sir?'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">8</span> I think he was swearing. At any rate, he did not reply directly.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">9</span> 'Can I do anything?' I asked again.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">10</span> 'You must just stand to one side,' he answered as he rose, first to his knees, then to his feet. The horse was raised, the dog silenced with the command, 'Down, Pilot!' The traveller now, bending down, felt his boot and leg, then sat down on the stile from which I had just risen.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">11</span> 'If you are hurt, and want help, sir, I can fetch someone from Thornfield Hall.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">12</span> 'Thank you. I have no broken bones.' He stood up again, but with an exclamation of pain.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">13</span> A little daylight remained, and the moon was brightening. I could see him plainly. He wore a riding coat with a fur collar. He had a dark face, with severe features and a heavy forehead. His eyes and lowered eyebrows looked angry just now. He was past youth, but had not yet reached middle age. I felt no fear of him, and little awkwardness. If he had been a good-looking young gentleman, if he had smiled and refused my offer gaily and with thanks, I should have gone on my way, but the roughness of the traveller put me at my ease, and when he waved me to go, I remained where I was, saying:</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">14</span> 'I cannot think of leaving you, sir, at so late an hour, in this lonely place, till I see that you are fit to get on your horse.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">15</span> He looked directly at me for the first time.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">16</span> 'I should think you ought to be at home yourself,' he said. 'Where do you come from?'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">17</span> 'From just below.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">18</span> 'You live just below&#151;do you mean at that house?' He pointed at Thornfield Hall.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">19</span> 'Yes, sir.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">20</span> 'Whose house is it?'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">21</span> 'Mr Rochester's.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">22</span> 'Do you know Mr Rochester?'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">23</span> 'No, I have never seen him.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">24</span> 'You are not a servant at the Hall, of course. You are&#151;' He stopped, looked at my simple dress, and seemed puzzled.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">25</span> 'I am the governess.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">26</span> 'Ah, the governess!' he repeated. 'I had forgotten.' In two minutes he rose from the stile. His face expressed pain as he tried to move.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">27</span> 'You may help me a little,' he said, 'if you will be so kind. I must beg you to come here.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">28</span> I came. 'Excuse me,' he continued. 'Necessity forces me to make use of you.' He laid a heavy hand on my shoulder, and leaning on me with some force, moved towards his horse. Having once caught it, he mastered it directly, and sprang into the saddle.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">29</span> 'Now,' he said, 'just hand me my whip: it is over by the hedge.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">30</span> I found it.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">31</span> 'Thank you. Now get home as fast as you can.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">32</span> A touch of his heel, and horse, dog and man had disappeared down the hill.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">33</span> I walked on to the village with my letter, a little stirred with excitement. It was a small event, but it marked with change one hour of my dull life.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">34</span> I did not like re-entering Thornfield. To pass inside was to pass into too quiet an existence. For some time I remained on the lawn. The clock struck, and I went in.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">35</span> The hall was not dark. A warm, unaccustomed light came from the dining room, and through the open door I could see a bright fire. I heard a murmur of voices, and saw a group near the fireplace.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">36</span> I hastened to Mrs Fairfax's room, but I found no candle and no Mrs Fairfax. Instead, all alone on the rug in front of the fire, I recognised a large black and white dog. It got up and came to me. I rang the bell, as I wanted a candle. A maid entered.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">37</span> 'Whose dog is this?'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">38</span> 'He came with master.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">39</span> 'With whom?'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">40</span> 'With master&#151;with Mr Rochester&#151;he has just arrived.' </p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">41</span> 'Indeed! Is Mrs Fairfax with him?'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">42</span> 'Yes, and Miss Adèle. They are in the dining room, and John has gone for a doctor, because master has had an accident. His horse fell.'</p>
