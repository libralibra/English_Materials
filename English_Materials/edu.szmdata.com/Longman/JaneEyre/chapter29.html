<p class="storyTitle">Chapter 29 The marriage is stopped</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">1</span> The maid came at seven the next morning to dress me. She took a long time, and when I went down Mr Rochester was waiting impatiently at the foot of the stairs. He told me he would give me only ten minutes to eat some breakfast. Meanwhile he commanded the luggage and the carriage to be brought to the door.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">2</span> 'Jane, are you ready?'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">3</span> I rose. There were no guests, no relations to wait for. Mr Rochester hurried me out of the house.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">4</span> I can still remember the grey old church outside the gates of Thornfield, rising calm before me, with a red morning sky beyond. I have not forgotten, either, the figures of two strangers wandering about the churchyard, who passed round to the back when they saw us. They were not noticed by Mr Rochester, who was looking earnestly in my face.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">5</span> We entered the quiet building, and took our places. The priest and the clerk were waiting, and the service began.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">6</span> The explanation of the purpose and duties of marriage was read through, and then the clergyman came a step forward, and, bending slightly towards Mr Rochester, went on:</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">7</span> 'I require and advise you both, if either of you knows of any reason why you may not be lawfully united in marriage, to confess it now.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">8</span> He paused, as the custom is. When is the pause after that sentence ever broken by reply? Not, perhaps, once in a hundred years. The clergyman had not lifted his eyes from his book; he had waited only a moment, and was continuing, when a voice near by said:</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">9</span> 'The marriage cannot go on. I declare the existence of a hindrance.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">10</span> The priest looked at the speaker. It was one of the strangers whom I had noticed earlier. Mr Rochester moved slightly, and standing more firmly, said:</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">11</span> 'Go on.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">12</span> 'The ceremony must be broken off,' repeated the voice behind us. 'I am in a position to prove my statement.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">13</span> The priest hesitated.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">14</span> 'What is the nature of the hindrance? Perhaps it may be explained away?'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">15</span> 'Hardly,' was the answer. Pronouncing each word plainly, calmly, steadily, the speaker continued:</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">16</span> 'It is simply based on the existence of an earlier marriage. Mr Rochester has a wife living.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">17</span> I looked at Mr Rochester: I made him look at me. His whole face was like colourless rock: his eyes both spark and steel. Without speaking, without smiling, he only encircled my waist with his arm and held me to his side.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">18</span> 'Who are you?' he asked the stranger.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">19</span> 'My name is Briggs. I am a lawyer.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">20</span> 'And you claim that I have a wife?'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">21</span> 'I remind you of the lady's existence, sir, which the law recognises, if you do not.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">22</span> 'Give me an account of her&#151;her name, her family.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">23</span> 'Certainly.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">24</span> Mr Briggs took a paper from his pocket and read in a calm voice:</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">25</span> 'I state and can prove that Edward Rochester, of Thornfield Hall, was married to my sister, Bertha Mason, at Spanish Town, Jamaica, fifteen years ago. The details of the marriage will be found in the church records there. A copy is now in my possession. Signed, Richard Mason.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">26</span> 'If that is a true statement, it may prove that I have been married, but it does not prove that the woman mentioned in it is still living.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">27</span> 'She was living three months ago. I have a witness to the fact.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">28</span> 'Where is he?'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">29</span> 'He is present. Mr Mason, have the goodness to step forward.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">30</span> Mr Rochester, on hearing the name, ground his teeth. I felt a sudden movement of fury or despair run through him. The second stranger, who had till now remained in the shadows, approached. A pale face looked over the lawyer's shoulder. It was Mason himself. Mr Rochester turned and fixed him with his eyes. He moved, lifted his strong arm&#151;he could have struck Mason, knocked him to the church floor, but the man moved back trembling, and cried out faintly.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">31</span> 'Sir,' said the priest, 'do not forget that you are in a holy place.' Then, addressing Mason, he inquired gently, 'Do you know, sir, whether this gentleman's wife is still living?'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">32</span> 'She is now living at Thornfield Hall,' said Mason, in a low, hesitating voice. 'I saw her there last April.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">33</span> 'At Thornfield Hall!' exclaimed the clergyman. 'Impossible! I have lived many years in this neighbourhood, sir, and never heard of a Mrs Rochester there.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">34</span> I saw a bitter smile twist Mr Rochester's lips, and he said between his teeth:</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">35</span> 'No, by God! I took care that none should hear of her under that name.' He was silent for some minutes, and then went on, 'Enough! All shall be made known at once. Close your book. There will be no wedding today.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">36</span> And Mr Rochester began his story:</p>
