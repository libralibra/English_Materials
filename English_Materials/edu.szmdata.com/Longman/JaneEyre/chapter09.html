<p class="storyTitle">Chapter 9 Miss Temple</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">1</span> Before the half hour ended, the bell rang. School was over, and all went into the dining room for tea. I now dared to get down and creep into a corner. The courage that had supported me was beginning to fade, and I felt so miserable that I sank down with my face on the ground. I wept. I had meant to be so good, to do so much at Lowood, to make so many friends, to deserve respect and love. Already I had made progress in class and received praise from my teachers, and I was well liked by my fellow pupils and treated as an equal by those of my own age. But now all hope was over, and I could only wish to die.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">2</span> Someone approached. It was Helen Burns. She brought me my coffee and bread.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">3</span> 'Come, eat something,' she said, but I put both away from me, and continued to weep aloud.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">4</span> 'Helen, why do you stay with a girl whom everybody believes to be a liar, and whom everyone scorns?'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">5</span> 'Jane, you are mistaken. Probably not one in the school either dislikes or scorns you. Many, I am sure, pity you.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">6</span> 'How can they pity me after what Mr Brocklehurst has said?'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">7</span> 'Mr Brocklehurst is not a god, nor is he even a great and admired man. He is not much liked here. If he had treated you with special favour, you would have found enemies. As it is, most of the girls would offer you sympathy if they dared. Teachers and pupils may look coldly at you for a day or two, but there are friendly feelings in their hearts. Besides, Jane&#160;...&#160;' She paused.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">8</span> 'Well, Helen?'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">9</span> 'If all the world hated you, and believed you to be wicked, while your own conscience approved of you, you could still hold up your head.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">10</span> I was silent. Helen had calmed me. Resting my head on her shoulder, I put my arm around her waist. We had not sat long like this, when Miss Temple came in.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">11</span> 'I came on purpose to find you, Jane Eyre,' she said. 'I want you in my room, and as Helen Burns is with you, she may come too.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">12</span> We followed her into her sitting room, where she called me to her side.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">13</span> 'Is it all over?' she asked, looking down at my face. 'Have you cried your sorrow away?'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">14</span> 'I shall never do that.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">15</span> 'Why?'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">16</span> 'Because I have been wrongly accused, and you, ma'am, and everybody else, will think me to be wicked.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">17</span> 'We shall think you what you prove yourself to be, my child. Continue to behave like a good girl, and you will satisfy us.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">18</span> 'Shall I, Miss Temple?'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">19</span> 'You will. Now, Jane, you know that when a criminal is accused, he is always allowed to speak in his own defence. You have been charged with telling lies. Defend yourself to me as well as you can. Say whatever your memory suggests to be true, but add nothing.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">20</span> Thus encouraged, I thought for a few minutes, and having arranged my story in order, I told her the history of my childhood. As I went on, I felt that she fully believed me.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">21</span> In the course of the story, I mentioned that Mr Lloyd had come to see me during my illness. When I had finished, Miss Temple looked at me for a few minutes in silence. She then said:</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">22</span> 'I know Mr Lloyd. I shall write to him. If his reply is satisfactory, you shall be publicly cleared of the charges against you. To me, you are cleared now.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">23</span> She kissed me, and still keeping me by her side, where I was very content to stand, went on to address Helen Burns.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">24</span> 'How are you tonight, Helen? Have you coughed much today?'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">25</span> 'Not quite so much, ma'am, I think.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">26</span> 'And the pain in your chest?'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">27</span> 'It is a little better.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">28</span> Miss Temple looked thoughtful for a few minutes, then rang the bell and ordered tea. Having invited Helen and me to approach the table and drink, she unlocked a cupboard and brought out a good-sized cake. She looked on with a satisfied smile as we enjoyed the food, such a rare feast to us.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">29</span> After tea, she again invited us to the fire. We sat on either side of her, and I listened with respect and admiration to the conversation between her and Helen. The meal, the bright fire, the presence of her dearly loved teacher, seemed to have stirred Helen and broken down her silence. Her fine features looked full of life, and her intelligent eyes flashed as she and Miss Temple spoke of things that I had never heard of, of nations and times in the past, of countries far away, of books and writers. What stores of knowledge they possessed! How many books they had read!</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">30</span> All too soon the bell rang for bedtime. No delay could be allowed. Miss Temple kissed us both, saying as she did so:</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">31</span> 'God bless you, my children!'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">32</span> About a week after these events, Miss Temple called the school together, announced that an inquiry had been made into the charges against Jane Eyre, and stated that she was most happy to be able to declare her completely cleared. The teachers then shook hands with me, and a murmur of pleasure ran through the rows of my companions.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">33</span> I was thus relieved of a very heavy load, and from that hour I set to work once more. I studied hard, and was rewarded with success. My memory improved, and in a few weeks I was moved to a higher class. In less than two months I was allowed to begin French and drawing. My ambition was now stirred, and in spite of the hardness of my life, I would not have exchanged Lowood for all the comforts of Gateshead.</p>
