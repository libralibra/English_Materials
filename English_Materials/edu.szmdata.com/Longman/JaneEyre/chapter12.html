<p class="storyTitle">Chapter 12 At Thornfield</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">1</span> I was quite alone in the world&#151;a strange feeling for an inexperienced girl.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">2</span> I had left Lowton at four o'clock in the morning, and now, at eight o'clock in the same evening, I was at the George Inn at Millcote, a large manufacturing town, waiting to be met and taken to Thornfield. The first feeling of adventure had changed to one of fear, and all sorts of doubts were troubling me.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">3</span> After half an hour, I rang the bell.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">4</span> 'Is there a place in this neighbourhood called Thornfield?' I asked the waiter who answered my call.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">5</span> 'Thornfield? I don't know, ma'am. I'll inquire.' He went away, but reappeared almost immediately.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">6</span> 'Is your name Eyre, miss?'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">7</span> 'Yes.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">8</span> 'There is a person waiting for you.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">9</span> A man was standing at the entrance to the inn, and in the lamp-fit street I saw faintly a one-horse carriage.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">10</span> 'I suppose,' I thought, 'judging from the plainness of the servant and the carriage, Mrs Fairfax is not a very fashionable person. All the better for me. I have only once lived amongst fine people, and I was very miserable with them. I wonder if she lives all alone except for this little girl. I pray God that she may not be like Mrs Reed, but if she is, I am not forced to stay with her. If I am not satisfied, I can advertise again.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">11</span> The roads were heavy, the night full of mist. My driver let his horse walk all the way. It was two hours before he got down and opened a pair of gates. We passed through, went slowly up an avenue and came to the long front of a house. The door was opened by a maid.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">12</span> 'Will you come this way, ma'am?' said the girl. I followed her across a square hall, and she showed me into a room with a pleasant view.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">13</span> It was a comfortable, small room. There was a round table by a cheerful fire, and a high-backed, old-fashioned armchair, in which sat the neatest little old lady, in a widow's cap and a black silk dress with a snowy white cloth tied round her waist. She was occupied in sewing, and a large black cat sat at her feet. A more encouraging introduction for a new governess could hardly be imagined. As I entered, the old lady got up and came forward to meet me.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">14</span> 'How do you do, my dear? I am afraid you have had a long drive. John drives so slowly. You must be cold: come to the fire.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">15</span> 'Mrs Fairfax, I suppose?'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">16</span> 'Yes, you are right. Do sit down.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">17</span> She led me to her own chair, and began to remove my coat. I begged that she would not give herself so much trouble. She then ordered me a hot drink and something to eat, and went off to see that my luggage was carried to my room.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">18</span> 'She treats me like a visitor,' I thought. 'This is not like what I have heard of the treatment of governesses.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">19</span> I felt rather confused at being the object of more attention than I had ever before received, and that, too, shown by my employer.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">20</span> 'Shall I have the pleasure of seeing Miss Fairfax tonight?'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">21</span> 'Miss Fairfax? Oh, you mean Miss Ad√®le Varens! Varens is the name of your future pupil.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">22</span> 'Indeed! Then she is not your daughter?'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">23</span> 'No&#151;I have no family. I am so glad you have come,' she continued. 'It will be quite pleasant living here now with a companion. In the winter one feels so gloomy alone with only the servants. But I'll not keep you sitting up late tonight. It is nearly twelve now, and you have been travelling all day.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">24</span> She took her candle, and after seeing that the front door was fastened, led the way upstairs. A very cold air filled the dark staircase and the long passage, and I was glad to find that my own room was small, and furnished in an ordinary modern way.</p>
