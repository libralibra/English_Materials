<p class="storyTitle">Chapter 43 Whom I love best</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">1</span> Very early next morning I heard him go downstairs. As soon as the servants came down, I heard the question, 'Is Miss Eyre here?' Then, 'Which room did you put her in? Is she up? Go and ask her if she wants anything, and when she will come down.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">2</span> Entering the breakfast room very softly, I had a view of him before he discovered my presence. He sat in his chair, lines of sadness marking his strong features.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">3</span> 'It is a bright sunny morning, sir,' I said. 'The rain is over and gone. You must go for a walk.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">4</span> I had stirred him into life. He smiled.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">5</span> Most of the morning was spent out of doors. After a time he urged me to tell of my experiences during the last year. I began my story, but I softened the description of my three days of wandering a good deal.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">6</span> He told me that I should not have left him thus, without means of supporting myself. He was certain that I had suffered more than I had admitted to him.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">7</span> 'Well, whatever my sufferings were, they were short,' I answered. I then told of my welcome by the Rivers family, and of all that followed.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">8</span> 'This St John, then, is your cousin?'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">9</span> 'Yes.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">10</span> 'You have spoken of him often. Do you like him?'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">11</span> 'He is a very good man, sir. I could not help liking him.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">12</span> 'A good man. Does that mean a respectable man of fifty?'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">13</span> 'St John is only twenty-nine, sir.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">14</span> 'Is he a dull person, short and ugly?'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">15</span> 'He is a good-looking man: tall, fair, with blue eyes.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">16</span> 'But his brain? It is probably rather soft?'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">17</span> 'He talks little, sir, but what he says is always worth listening to. He is a truly intelligent man.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">18</span> 'Did you like him, Jane?'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">19</span> 'Yes, Mr Rochester, I liked him. But you asked me that before.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">20</span> Jealousy had got hold of him, but the sting was bringing him back to life.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">21</span> 'Did he visit you often at your school?'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">22</span> 'Daily.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">23</span> 'You had a cottage near the school, you say. Did he ever come there to see you?'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">24</span> 'Sometimes.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">25</span> A pause.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">26</span> 'Did Rivers spend much time with the ladies of the family while you were living with them?'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">27</span> 'Yes, we worked in the same room.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">28</span> 'What did you study?'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">29</span> 'I learnt German, at first.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">30</span> 'Did he teach you?'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">31</span> 'He does not understand German. He taught me a little Hindustani.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">32</span> 'Rivers taught you Hindustani?'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">33</span> 'Yes, sir.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">34</span> 'And his sisters also?'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">35</span> 'No, only me.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">36</span> 'Did you ask to learn?'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">37</span> 'No, he wished to teach me.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">38</span> 'Why did he wish it? Of what use could Hindustani be to you?'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">39</span> 'He intended me to go to India with him.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">40</span> 'He wanted to marry you?'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">41</span> 'He asked me to marry him.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">42</span> 'That is an invention, to annoy me.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">43</span> 'I beg your pardon, sir. He did ask me, and was as earnest in urging me as ever you could be.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">44</span> 'Miss Eyre, you can leave me. Go and marry this Rivers.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">45</span> 'He will never be my husband. He does not love me, nor I him. He wanted me only because he thought I should make a suitable missionary's wife. He is good and great, but too cold for me. Must I leave you, sir, to go to him?'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">46</span> 'What, Jane! Is that really how things are?'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">47</span> 'Absolutely, sir.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">48</span> 'You wish to be friends, Jane?'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">49</span> 'Yes, sir.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">50</span> 'Ah, Jane, but I want a wife.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">51</span> 'Do you, sir?'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">52</span> 'Yes. Is it news to you?'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">53</span> 'Choose then, sir&#151;her who loves you best.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">54</span> 'I will at least choose&#151;her whom I love best. Jane, will you marry me?'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">55</span> 'Yes, sir.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">56</span> 'A poor blind man, whom you will have to lead about by the hand?'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">57</span> 'Most truly, sir.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">58</span> A little later, he said:</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">59</span> 'Jane, a curious thing happened to me a few days ago. I think it was last Monday night. I had long had the belief that, since I could not find you, you must be dead. Late that night I began to pray for death also. My punishment, I felt, had lasted long enough: I asked God to end it. My heart's wishes broke from my lips in the words&#151;"Jane! Jane! Jane!"</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">60</span> 'You will think that I imagined things, but what I tell you now is true. As I called, a voice, I cannot tell from where, replied: "I am coming. Wait for me," and a moment later the words&#151;"Where are you?" were whispered on the wind. In spirit, I believe, we must have met.'</p>
