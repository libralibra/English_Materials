<p class="storyTitle">Chapter 17 Grace Poole</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">1</span> I both wished and feared to see Mr Rochester on the day which followed this sleepless night. The morning, however, passed just as usual. Nothing happened to interrupt the course of Ad√®le's quiet studies. Soon after breakfast I heard servants busy near Mr Rochester's bedroom. When I passed it later on I saw that all was once more in complete order. A woman was sitting on a chair by the bedside, sewing rings on new curtains. It was Grace Poole.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">2</span> There she sat, busy at her work, with her hard face and her ordinary-looking features, not in the least like a woman who had attempted murder and been discovered. She looked up as I stared at her, and said, 'Good morning, miss,' in her usual manner. No movement, no change of colour in her face, gave any sign of feeling, of consciousness of guilt, or of fear that she might be found out.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">3</span> 'I will test her in some way,' I thought.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">4</span> 'Good morning, Grace,' I said aloud. 'Has anything happened here? I thought I heard the servants all talking together a short time ago.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">5</span> 'Only master was reading in bed last night, and fell asleep with his candle lit, and the curtains caught fire. Fortunately he awoke in time and put it out.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">6</span> 'A strange affair!' I said, in a low voice. Then, looking at her fixedly, 'Did Mr Rochester wake nobody?'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">7</span> She raised her eyes to me, and seemed to examine me carefully. Then she answered:</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">8</span> 'The servants sleep so far off, you know, miss, that they would not be likely to hear. Mrs Fairfax's room and yours are nearest to master's. Mrs Fairfax says she heard nothing. When people are getting old they often sleep heavily.' She paused, and then added, with an appearance of carelessness:</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">9</span> 'But you are young, miss, and perhaps a light sleeper. Did you hear a noise?'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">10</span> 'I did,' I said in a low voice. 'At first I thought it was Pilot, but Pilot cannot laugh, and I am certain that I heard a laugh, and a strange one.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">11</span> She threaded her needle with a steady hand, and then observed calmly:</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">12</span> 'It is hardly likely that master would laugh, miss, when he was in danger. You must have been dreaming.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">13</span> 'I was not dreaming,' I replied. Again she looked at me.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">14</span> 'Have you told master that you heard a laugh?' she inquired.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">15</span> 'I have not had the opportunity of speaking to him this morning.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">16</span> 'You did not think of opening your door, and looking out?'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">17</span> 'Quite the opposite,' I said. 'I locked my door.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">18</span> 'Then you are not in the habit of locking your door every night?'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">19</span> The idea suggested itself to me, that if she discovered that I knew of, or suspected, her guilt, she might be playing some of her evil tricks on me. Perhaps she was trying to find out my habits. I replied sharply:</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">20</span> 'In future I shall take good care to lock everything before I lie down.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">21</span> 'It would be wise to do so,' was her answer.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">22</span> I hardly heard Mrs Fairfax's account of the fire during dinner. I was occupied in puzzling my brains over the mysterious character of Grace Poole, and still more over her position at Thornfield, and the reason why she had not been arrested, or at least dismissed from service. Mr Rochester had admitted her guilt, but had made me swear to keep the secret. It was strange that a bold, proud gentleman should be in the power of one of his own servants.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">23</span> I waited impatiently for the hour when I should see Mr Rochester that evening. I had many things to say to him. I wanted to introduce the subject of Grace Poole, and hear what he would answer.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">24</span> At last a servant made her appearance, but it was only to say that tea was ready in Mrs Fairfax's room.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">25</span> 'You must want your tea,' said the good lady, as I joined her. 'You ate so little at dinner. I am afraid you are not well today. You look feverish.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">26</span> 'Oh, I am quite well!'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">27</span> 'Mr Rochester has had a favourable day for his journey,' she went on.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">28</span> 'Journey! Has Mr Rochester gone anywhere?'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">29</span> 'Oh, he set out the moment he had breakfasted. He has gone to the Leas, Mr Eshton's house, ten miles on the other side of Millcote. I believe there is quite a party gathered there.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">30</span> 'Do you expect him back tonight?'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">31</span> 'No. I should think he is very likely to stay a week or more. Mr Rochester is so entertaining and so full of high spirits in society that I believe he is popular everywhere. The ladies are very fond of him.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">32</span> 'Are there ladies at the Leas?'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">33</span> There are Mrs Eshton and her daughters&#151;very fashionable young ladies indeed, and there are the Misses Blanche and Mary Ingram, most beautiful women. When Blanche was here at a Christmas entertainment, she was considered the beauty of the evening.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">34</span> 'What was she like?'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">35</span> 'Tall, with a long, graceful neck, noble features, large black eyes, as bright as her jewels, and a fine head of black curly hair.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">36</span> 'She was greatly admired, of course?'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">37</span> 'Yes, and not only for her beauty, but for her accomplishments. She sings. She and Mr Rochester sang together.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">38</span> 'I did not know that Mr Rochester could sing.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">39</span> 'Oh, he has a fine voice, and an excellent taste in music. He thinks very highly of Miss Ingram's singing.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">40</span> 'And this beautiful and accomplished lady is not yet married?'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">41</span> 'I believe that neither she nor her sister have very large fortunes.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">42</span> When I was once more alone, I reviewed the information that I had received. I looked into my heart, examined its thoughts and feelings, and tried to bring them back to common sense. I addressed myself with severity:</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">43</span> 'A greater fool than you, Jane Eyre, never breathed the breath of life. <em>You</em> favoured by Mr Rochester? <em>You</em> of importance to him in any way? Go! Your foolishness disgusts me. The attentions paid to a woman by her employer mean nothing to him. It is madness to let a secret love take fire within you.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">44</span> 'Listen, then, Jane Eyre, to your punishment. Tomorrow, place the mirror before you, and draw yourself faithfully, without softening one fault. Write under it: "Picture of a governess, poor and plain."</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">45</span> 'Afterwards, draw the most beautiful face that you can imagine, paint it in your softest colours, according to the description given by Mrs Fairfax. Call it "Blanche, an accomplished lady of rank".</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">46</span> 'Whenever, in future, you should chance to suppose that Mr Rochester thinks well of you, take out the two pictures and compare them.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">47</span> I did so, and before long I had cause to congratulate myself on the discipline which I had forced upon my feelings.</p>
