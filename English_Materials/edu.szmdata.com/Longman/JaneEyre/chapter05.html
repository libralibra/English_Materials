<p class="storyTitle">Chapter 5 Journey by coach</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">1</span> Five o'clock had hardly struck on the morning of January 19th, when Bessie brought a candle into my little corner and found me already up and dressed. I was to leave Gateshead that day by a coach that passed the house at six o'clock. Bessie had lit a fire in the nursery, where she now began to get my breakfast. Few children can eat when excited at the thought of a journey. I could not. When Bessie had urged me in vain to take a few spoonfuls of the boiled milk and bread that she had prepared for me, she wrapped up some cake in paper and put it in my bag. Then she helped me to put on my coat and hat, and we left the nursery.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">2</span> As we passed Mrs Reed's bedroom, Bessie said:</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">3</span> 'Will you go in and say goodbye to Missis?'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">4</span> 'No, Bessie. She came to my bed last night when you had gone down to supper, and said I need not disturb her in the morning, or my cousins either; and she told me to remember that she had always been my best friend.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">5</span> 'What did you say, Miss?'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">6</span> 'Nothing. I covered my face with the sheet, and turned from her to the wall.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">7</span> 'That was wrong, Miss Jane.'</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">8</span> 'Goodbye to Gateshead!' I cried, as we passed through the hall and went out of the front door.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">9</span> It was very dark, and Bessie carried a lamp. The winter morning was damp and cold as I hastened to the gate. My box, which had been carried there the night before, stood ready. It was only a few minutes to six, and shortly after, the distant roll of wheels announced that the coach was coming. There it was, with its four horses, and its top loaded with passengers. The coachman and the guard loudly urged haste, my box was lifted up, and I was taken from Bessie's neck, on which I hung with kisses.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">10</span> 'Be sure and take good care of her,' she cried to the guard, as he lifted me inside.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">11</span> The door was closed. In this way I was separated from Bessie and Gateshead, in this way carried away to unknown and, as it seemed to me, far-off and mysterious places.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">12</span> I remember very little of the journey. I only know that the day seemed endless, and that we appeared to travel over hundreds of miles of road. We passed through several towns, and in one large one the coach stopped, the horses were taken out, and the passengers got down to dine. I was carried into an inn, where the guard wanted me to have some food, but I could not eat. He left me in an immense room, where I walked up and down, greatly afraid of someone coming and taking me away, because I had heard about children being stolen in many of Bessie's stories.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">13</span> We continued on our way. The wet, misty afternoon changed to twilight. We passed no more towns. The scenery was different, and great grey hills appeared in the distance. We drove down a valley, dark with woods.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">14</span> At last I fell asleep, but soon the stopping of the coach awoke me. The door was open, and a person was standing by it. I saw her face and dress by the light of the lamps.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">15</span> 'Is there a little girl called Jane Eyre here?' she asked.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">16</span> I answered, 'Yes,' and was lifted out. My box was handed down, and the coach instantly drove away.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">17</span> I was stiff from sitting so long, and confused with the noise and movement of the coach. Gathering up my senses, I looked around me. Rain, wind and darkness filled the air. However, I saw faintly before me a wall, and a door open in it. Through this door I passed with my new guide. A house with many windows, in some of which lights were burning, could now be seen. We went up a broad path and were admitted at a door, then I was led through a passage into a room with a fire, and left alone.</p>
