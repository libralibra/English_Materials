<p class="storyTitle">I GO TO BRISTOL</p>

<p>It was longer than Mr. Trelawney imagined before we were ready for the sea, and none of our first plans&#151;not even Dr. Livesey's, of keeping me beside him&#151;could be carried out as we intended. The doctor had to go to London for someone to carry on his work. Mr. Trelawney was hard at work at Bristol; and I lived on at the Hall under the charge of old Redruth, the gardener, almost a prisoner, but full of sea-dreams about strange islands and all sorts of excitements. I sat by the hour over the map, every line of which I well remembered.</p>

<p>So the weeks passed on, till one fine day there came a letter addressed to Dr. Livesey, with this added, "To be opened, in the case of his absence, by Tom Redruth, or young Hawkins." Obeying this order, we found, or rather I found&#151;for Tom was a poor hand at reading anything but print&#151;the following important news:</p>

<blockquote class="brush">

<p class="r">Old Ship Inn,</p>

<p class="r">Bristol,</p>

<p class="r">March 1, 1759.</p>

<p>Dear Livesey,&#151;As I do not know whether you are at the Hall or still in London, I send this in double to both places.</p>

<p>The ship is bought and fitted. She lies in the harbour, ready for sea. You never imagined a sweeter vessel&#151;a child might sail her; name, <span class="underlined">Hispaniola</span>.</p>

<p>I got her through my old friend, Blandly, who has proved himself a surprisingly good and useful fellow. He has worked like a slave for me, and so, I may say, did everyone in Bristol, as soon as they heard the port we sailed for&#151;treasure, I mean.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>"Redruth," said I, "Dr. Livesey will not like that. Mr. Trelawney has been talking, after all."</p>

<p>"Well, who has a better right?" answered Tom. "It's a strange thing indeed if the master may not talk just because Dr. Livesey says so!"</p>

<p>At that I said no more, but read straight on:</p>

<blockquote class="brush">

<p>Blandly himself found the <span class="underlined">Hispaniola</span>, and got her for a very small amount of money. There is a class of men in Bristol who are very much against Blandly. They were declaring that this honest fellow would do anything for money, that the <span class="underlined">Hispaniola</span> belonged to him, and that he sold it to me at a very high price. Such lies disprove themselves! But none of them dare to say that the ship is not a good one.</p>

<p>So far there has been no sort of difficulty. The work-people, to be sure, were very slow; but they were better later on. It was the crew that troubled me.</p>

<p>I wanted twenty men&#151;in case we meet natives, pirates, or the French&#151;and I had the greatest difficulty in finding so much as half a dozen, till the most wonderful piece of good fortune brought me the very man that I required.</p>

<p>I was standing at the harbour-side, when, by the merest accident, I fell into talk with him. I found he was an old sailor, kept an inn, knew all the seamen in Bristol, had lost his health on shore, and wanted work as a cook to get to sea again. He had crept down there that morning, he said, to get a smell of the salt.</p>

<p>I was very much moved by his story&#151;so would you have been. Out of pure pity, I employed him to be ship's cook. Long John Silver, he is called, and has lost a leg; but that I regarded as a point in his favour, since he lost it in his country's service. The Government did nothing for him, Livesey. What bad times we live in!</p>

<p>Well, sir, I thought I had only found a cook, but it was a crew I had discovered. Between Silver and myself we got together in a few days a company of the finest old 'salts' you can imagine, not pretty to look at, but fellows, by their faces, of splendid spirit. I declare we could fight a battle-ship.</p>

<p>Long John even sent away two out of the six or seven I had already taken. He showed me in a moment that they were just the sort of fresh-water creatures we had to fear in an important and dangerous voyage.</p>

<p>I am in splendid health and spirits, eating like a lion, sleeping like a tree, yet I shall not enjoy a moment till my ship sets sail. Seaward ho! Hang the treasure! It's the glory of the sea that has turned my head. So now, Livesey, come quickly; do not lose an hour, if you respect me.</p>

<p>Let young Hawkins go at once to see his mother, with Redruth for a guard; and then both come full speed to Bristol.</p>

<p class="r">John Trelawney.</p>

<p>&#160;</p>

<p>Note.&#151;I did not tell you that Blandly, who, by the way, is to send a ship after us if we don't return by the end of August, had found an excellent fellow for sailing-master. Long John Silver discovered a very useful man for first officer, a man named Arrow.</p>

<p>I forget to tell you that Silver is a man of some wealth. He leaves his wife to keep the inn; I guess that it is the wife, quite as much as the health, that sends him back to wandering.</p>

<p class="signature">J. T.</p>

<p>&#160;</p>

<p>Note.&#151;Hawkins may stay one night with his mother.</p>

<p class="signature">J. T.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>You can fancy the excitement in which that letter put me. I was half mad with delight; and if ever I thought shame of a man, it was of old Tom Redruth, who could do nothing but weep and complain. Any of the other men in the place would gladly have changed places with him; but such was not the master's wish, and the master's wish was like law among them all. Nobody but old Redruth would have dared so much as even to complain.</p>

<p>The next morning he and I set out on foot for the "Benbow," and there I found my mother in good health and spirits. I said good-bye to mother and the bay where I had lived since I was born, and the dear old "Benbow."</p>

<p>In the carriage I was between Redruth and a fat old gentleman, and, in spite of the swift movement and the cold night air, I must have slept a great deal from the very first, and then slept like a log, up and down the hills, hour after hour. When I opened my eyes, I found that we were standing still before a large building in a city street, and that it was full daylight.</p>

<p>"Where are we?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Bristol," said Tom. "Get down."</p>

<p>In front of a large inn stood Mr. Trelawney, all dressed out like a sea-officer, in thick blue cloth.</p>

<p>"Here you are," he cried, "and the doctor came last night from London. Excellent! The ship's company complete!</p>

<p>"Oh, sir," cried I, "when do we sail?"</p>

<p>"Sail!" said he. "We sail to-morrow!"</p>
