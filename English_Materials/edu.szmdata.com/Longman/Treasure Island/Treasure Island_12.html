<p class="storyTitle">A PLAN OF WAR</p>

<p>There was a great rush of feet. Slipping in an instant outside my barrel, I got behind the sail, and came out in the open in time to join Hunter and Dr. Livesey in the rush to the side of the ship.</p>

<p>There all were already collected. The mist had lifted almost at the same time as the moon appeared. Away to the south-west of us we saw two low hills, about a couple of miles apart, and rising behind one of them a third and higher hill, whose top was still hidden in the mist.</p>

<p>So much I saw, almost in a dream, for I had not yet recovered from my terrible fear of a minute or two before. And then I heard the voice of Captain Smollett issuing orders, and the <i>Hispaniola</i> swung on to a course that would just clear the island, on the east.</p>

<p>"And now, men," said the captain, "has any one of you ever seen that land before?"</p>

<p>"I have, sir," said Silver. "I went on shore to get water there with a trading ship I was cook in."</p>

<p>"There is a safe bay on the south, behind a little island, I fancy?" asked the captain.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. That bay was a great place for pirates once. That big hill with a cloud on it was called by the pirates the Spy-glass, because of the look-out man they used to keep there when they were cleaning their ships in the bay."</p>

<p>"I have a map here," said Captain Smollett. "See if that's the place."</p>

<p>Long John's eyes burned in his head as he took the map; but by the fresh look of the paper, I knew that it was not what he had hoped to see. This was not the map we found in Billy Bones's chest, but a careful copy, complete in all things except the red marks and the writing. Silver had the strength of mind to hide his feelings.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said he, "this is the spot to be sure; and very prettily drawn. Who might have done this map, I wonder? The pirates could not have done that. Yes, here it is: 'Captain Kidd's Bay'&#151;just the name my friend called it. There's a strong sea runs along the south, and then away northward up the west coast. You were right, sir, to change your course as you did."</p>

<p>"Thank you, my man," says Captain Smollett. "I'll ask you, later on, to give us a help. You may go."</p>

<p>I was surprised at the coolness with which John allowed us to see his knowledge of the island; and I own I was half-frightened when I saw him drawing nearer to myself. He did not know, to be sure, that I had heard his talk from the apple barrel, and yet I had, by this time, got such a fear and hatred of the man that I shook all over when he laid his hand on my arm.</p>

<p>"Ah," says he, "this here is a sweet spot, this island&#151;a sweet spot for a lad to go on shore. You'll bathe, and you'll climb trees, and you'll hunt goats, you will; and you'll run up those hills like a goat yourself. Why, it makes me young again."</p>

<p>And touching me in the friendliest way upon the shoulder, he went below.</p>

<p>Captain Smollett, Mr. Trelawney and Dr. Livesey were talking together, and, anxious as I was to tell them my story, I dared not go to them openly. While I was still trying to find some good reason for approaching them, Dr. Livesey called me to his side. He had left his pipe below, and, being a slave to it, had meant that I should fetch it; but as soon as I was near enough to speak and not to be heard by any others, I broke out immediately: "Doctor, let me speak. Get the captain and Mr. Trelawney away and then find some reason for sending for me. I have terrible news."</p>

<p>The doctor's face changed a little, but next moment he was master of himself.</p>

<p>"Thank you, Jim," said he quite loudly, "that was all I wanted to know," as if he had asked me a question.</p>

<p>And with that he turned on his heel and joined the other two. They spoke together for a little, and though none of them raised his voice, or so much as whistled, it was plain enough that Dr. Livesey had told them what I had said; for the next thing that I heard was the captain giving an order to Job Anderson, and all men were called together.</p>

<p>"My lads," said Captain Smollett, "I've a word to say to you. This land is the place we have been sailing to. Every man on board has done his duty, as I never ask to see it done better: so Mr. Trelawney and I and the doctor are going below to drink your health and good fortune, and you'll have rum served out for you to drink our health and fortune."</p>

<p>The three gentlemen went below, and, not long after, word was sent forward that Jim Hawkins was wanted.</p>

<p>I found them all three seated round the table, a bottle of Spanish wine and some fruit before them, and the doctor smoking away in a manner which showed that he was excited. "Now, Hawkins," said Mr. Trelawney, "you have something to say. Speak up."</p>

<p>I did as I was bidden and told in as few words as possible all that Silver and the others had said. Nobody said anything to me till I had finished, nor did any one of the three of them make so much as a movement, but they kept their eyes upon my face from first to last.</p>

<p>"Jim," said Dr. Livesey, "take a seat."</p>

<p>And they made me sit down at table beside them, poured me out a glass of wine, and all three, one after the other, and each with a bow, drank my good health, and their thanks to me for my good fortune and courage.</p>

<p>"Now, Captain," said Mr. Trelawney, "you were right, and I was wrong. I was an ass, and I am waiting your orders."</p>

<p>"No more an ass than I, sir," answered the captain. "I never knew a case like this before. When a crew is going to give trouble, or means to break out and murder its officers, it always shows signs of it, so that any man can see, and prepare for it. But this crew," he added, "beats me. I don't understand it."</p>

<p>"Captain," said the doctor, "allow me to say that this is because of Silver. He is a very unusual kind of man."</p>

<p>"He'd look unusually well hanging up with a rope round his neck, sir," replied the captain. But this is talk; this doesn't lead to anything. I see three or four things, and, if Mr. Trelawney permits, I'll name them."</p>

<p>"You, sir, are the captain. It is for you to speak," said Mr. Trelawney grandly.</p>

<p>"First point," began Mr. Smollett. "We must go on, because we can't turn back. If I gave the word to turn back, they would rise at once. Second point, we have time before us, at least until this treasure's found. Third point, there are faithful men. Now, sir, it's got to come to blows sooner or later; and what I say is, to act quickly and come to blows some fine day when they least expect it. We can be sure, I take it, of your own home servants, Mr. Trelawney?"</p>

<p>"As of myself," he declared.</p>

<p>"Three," said the captain; "and ourselves make seven, counting Hawkins, here. Now, about the honest men?"</p>

<p>"Most likely Trelawney's own men," said the doctor: "those he had picked up for himself, before he met Silver."</p>

<p>"No," he replied, "Hands was one of mine."</p>

<p>"I did think I could have trusted Hands," added the captain.</p>

<p>"And to think that they're all Englishmen!" broke out Mr. Trelawney. "Sir, I could find it in my heart to burn the ship and them in it."</p>

<p>"Well, gentlemen," said the captain, "the best that I can say is not much. We must wait, and keep a bright look out. It's difficult, I know. It would be pleasanter to come to blows. But there's no help for it till we know our men."</p>

<p>"Jim here," said the doctor, "can help us more than anyone. The men are not afraid of him, and Jim is a noticing lad."</p>

<p>"Hawkins, I put huge faith in you," added Mr. Trelawney.</p>

<p>This made me feel rather frightened, for I felt altogether helpless; and yet, by an odd set of events, it was indeed through me that safety came. But, for the present, talk as we pleased, there were only seven out of the twenty-six whom we knew we could trust; and, out of these seven, one was a boy, so that the grown men on our side were six to their nineteen.</p>
