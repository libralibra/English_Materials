<p class="chapter">Thirty</p>

<p class="storyTitle">A PRISONER</p>

<p>I was awakened by a clear voice calling to us from the edge of the wood:</p>

<p>"Log-house, ahoy!" it cried. "Here's the doctor."</p>

<p>And the doctor it was. Although I was glad to hear the sound, yet I felt ashamed to look him in the face.</p>

<p>When I ran to a hole and looked out, I saw him standing, like Silver once before, up to the middle in creeping mist.</p>

<p>"You, doctor! Top o' the morning to you, sir!" cried Silver, broad awake and shining with good nature in a moment. "Bright and early, to be sure: George, shake yourself, son, and help Dr. Livesey over the side. All doing well, your sick men, all well and merry&#160;...&#160;"</p>

<p>So he talked on, standing on the hill-top, with his stick under his arm, and one hand upon the side of the log-house&#151;quite the old John, in voice, manner, and expression.</p>

<p>"We've quite a surprise for you, too, sir," he continued. "We've a little stranger here&#151;ha! ha! A new lodger, sir, and looking in excellent health, slept like a log, he did."</p>

<p>Dr. Livesey was by this time across the stockade and near the cook; and I could hear the change in his voice as he said:</p>

<p>"Not Jim?"</p>

<p>"The very same Jim as ever was," said Silver.</p>

<p>The doctor stopped; he did not speak; it was some moments before he seemed able to move on.</p>

<p>"Well, well," he said at last, "duty first and pleasure afterwards, as you might have said yourself, Silver. Let us see these sick men of yours."</p>

<p>A moment afterwards he had entered the log-house, and, with one nod to me, proceeded with his work among the sick. He did not seem at all afraid, though he must have known that his life among these base fellows depended on a hair; and he talked to them as if he were paying a visit in a quiet English family. And the men behaved to him as if nothing had happened, as if he was still ship's doctor, and they common seamen under his charge.</p>

<p>"You are doing well, my friend," he said to the fellow with the broken head, "and if ever any person had a narrow escape, it was you; your head must be as hard as iron. Well, George, how goes it? You're a pretty colour, certainly; why, your stomach, man, is upside down. Did you take that oil? Did he take that oil, men?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, he took it, sure enough," replied Morgan.</p>

<p>"Because, you see, since I am pirates' doctor, or 'prison doctor', as I prefer to call it," said Dr. Livesey, in his pleasantest way, "I make it a point of honour not to lose a man for King George (God bless him!) and the hangman."</p>

<p>The men looked at each other, but said nothing to this.</p>

<p>"Dick doesn't feel well, sir," said one.</p>

<p>"Ah there," said Morgan, "that comes of cutting Bibles."</p>

<p>"It comes of being asses," replied the doctor, "and camping on that low land among the mists. Silver, I'm surprised at you; you don't seem to have any idea of the rules of health.</p>

<p>"Well," said the doctor, after he dealt with them all, more like school-children than blood-thirsty pirates&#151;"well, that's done for to-day. And now I should wish to have a talk with that boy, please."</p>

<p>And he nodded his head in my direction carelessly.</p>

<p>George Merry was at the door taking his oil; but he swung round at the doctor's words and cried "No!" with a curse.</p>

<p>Silver struck the barrel with his open hand.</p>

<p>"Si-lence!" he roared, and looked about him like a lion. "Doctor," he went on, in his usual voice, "I was thinking of that, knowing that you had a fancy for the boy. We all thank you for your kindness, and, as you see, put faith in you, and swallow your oils and your powders like that much rum. And I think I've found a way that will suit all. Hawkins, will you give me your word of honour not to try to escape?"</p>

<p>I gave the promise required.</p>

<p>"Then, doctor," said Silver, "you just step outside of that stockade, and once you're there, I'll bring the boy down on the inside, and you can talk between the cracks. Good-day to you, sir, and all our respects to Mr. Trelawney and Cap'n Smollett."</p>

<p>There was a burst of angry murmuring as soon as the doctor left the house: Silver was told that he was trying to make a separate peace for himself; in fact, of doing the exact thing that he <em>was</em> doing. It seemed so clear to me that I could not imagine how he was to turn their anger. But he was twice the man the rest were. He called them all fools, said that it was necessary that I should talk to the doctor, waved the map in their faces, asked them if they could break the bargain on the very same day that they were going treasure hunting.</p>

<p>"No, by thunder!" he cried, "it's us must break it when the time comes; and till then I'll deceive that doctor, and keep his eyes shut."</p>

<p>And then he ordered them to get the fire lit, and marched out upon his stick, with his hand on my shoulder, leaving them silenced, but not satisfied.</p>

<p>"Slow, lad, slow," he said. "They might turn upon us in a moment, if we were seen to hurry."</p>

<p>We advanced across the sand to where the doctor was waiting for us on the other side of the stockade, and as soon as we were within easy speaking distance, Silver stopped.</p>

<p>"You'll remember this here also, doctor," said he, "and the boy'll tell you how I saved his life, and was thrown off for it. Doctor, when a man's playing as dangerous a game as I am, you wouldn't think it too much to say a good word for him, and give him a bit of hope of mercy."</p>

<p>Silver was a changed man, once he was out there and had his back to his friends and the log-house; his cheeks seemed to have fallen in; his voice shook.</p>

<p>"Why, John, you're not afraid?" asked Dr. Livesey.</p>

<p>"I've got courage, doctor&#151;but I don't like the idea of hanging. And now I step to one side and leave you and Jim alone."</p>

<p>So saying, he stepped back a little way, till he was out of hearing, and there sat down upon a log and began to whistle, turning round now and again upon his seat to get a sight, sometimes of me and the doctor, sometimes of his dissatisfied crew as they moved about making breakfast.</p>

<p>"So, Jim," said the doctor sadly, "here you are. You have brought it upon yourself. Heaven knows, I cannot find it in my heart to blame you; but this much I will say, be it kind or unkind: when Captain Smollett was well, you would not have dared to go; and when he was ill, and couldn't prevent it, by George, it was really base of you."</p>

<p>I will own that I here began to weep. "Doctor," I said, "you might spare me. I have blamed myself enough; I shall lose my life, and indeed I should have been dead by now, if Silver hadn't stood for me; and doctor, believe this, I can die&#151;I dare say I deserve it&#151;but what I fear is that they may kill me <em>slowly</em>. If they do that&#151;"</p>

<p>"Jim," the doctor broke in, and his voice was quite changed, "Jim, I can't have this. Jump over and we'll run for it."</p>

<p>"Doctor," said I, "I passed my word."</p>

<p>"I know, I know," he cried. "But I can't let you stay here. Jump! One jump and we'll run like rabbits."</p>

<p>"No," I replied, "you wouldn't do it yourself. Silver trusted me; I passed my word, and back I go. But, doctor, you did not let me finish. When I'm in pain, I might let out a word of where the ship is; for I got the ship, part by good fortune and part by risking, and she lies in North Bay."</p>

<p>"The ship!" exclaimed the doctor.</p>

<p>Rapidly I described to him all that had happened, and he heard me out in silence.</p>

<p>"There is a kind of fate in this," he exclaimed, when I had done. "Every step, it's you that saves our lives, and do you suppose by any chance that we are going to let you lose yours? That would be a poor return, my boy. You found out their plans; you found Ben Gunn&#151;the best deed that ever you did, or will do, though you live to ninety. Oh, by heaven, and talking of Ben Gunn! Silver!" he cried, "Silver!&#151;I'll give you a piece of advice," he continued, as the cook drew near again; "don't you be in any great hurry after that treasure."</p>

<p>"Why, sir," said Silver, "I can only save my life and the boy's by seeking for that treasure."</p>

<p>"Well,' replied the doctor, "if that is so, I'll go one step further: look out for trouble when you find it."</p>

<p>"Sir," said Silver, "you've said too much or too little. What you're after, why you left the log-house, why you have given me that there map, I don't know. And yet I have carried out your orders with my eyes shut, and never a word of hope! But no, this thing is too much. If you won't tell me what you mean plain out, just say so, and I'll do nothing more for you."</p>

<p>"No," said the doctor, "I've no right to say more; it's not my secret, you see, Silver, or I'd tell it you. But I'll go as far with you as I dare go. And, first, I'll give you a bit of hope: Silver, if we both get alive out of this trap, I'll do my best to save you."</p>

<p>Silver's face shone. "You couldn't say more, I'm sure, sir, not even if you were my mother," he cried.</p>

<p>"And I'll give you a piece of advice," added the doctor. "Keep the boy close beside you; and, when you need help, give a shout. I'm off to seek it for you. Good-bye, Jim." </p>

<p>And Dr. Livesey shook hands with me through the stockade, nodded to Silver, and set off rapidly into the wood.</p>
