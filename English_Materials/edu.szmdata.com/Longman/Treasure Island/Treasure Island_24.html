<p class="storyTitle">WHAT HAPPENED TO THE BOAT</p>

<p>It was broad day when I awoke, and found myself at the south-west end of Treasure Island. The sun was up, but was still hidden from me behind the great mass of Spy-glass hill, which on this side descended almost to the sea in steep cliffs.</p>

<p>Haulbowline Head and Mizzenmast Hill were close; the hill bare and dark, the head outstanding with cliffs forty or fifty feet high, and edged with great masses of fallen rock. I was scarcely a quarter of a mile out to sea, and it was my first thought to row in to the land.</p>

<p>That idea was soon given up. The waves roared among the fallen rocks, and I saw that, if I dared to go nearer, I should be dashed to death upon the rough shore, or waste my strength trying to climb those cliffs.</p>

<p>Nor was that all; for, creeping over the flat tables of rock, or letting themselves drop into the sea with a loud "plop," were foul sea creatures, fifty or sixty of them. I have understood since that they were "sea-lions", and entirely harmless; but the sight of them, added to the difficulty of the shore and the great waves, was more than enough to make me dislike that landing-place.</p>

<p>The ship would, I knew, be carried to the north, and I preferred to leave Haulbowline Head behind me, and keep my strength for an attempt to land upon the Cape of the Woods.</p>

<p>The wind was blowing from behind me, and the waves rose and fell unbroken. I tried sitting up in the boat to row, but this made it too unsteady: the boat ran down a steep slope of water and struck her nose in the next wave, and I was almost lost.</p>

<p>"Well, now," thought I, "it is clear that I must lie down so as to keep the boat steady, but I can give her a push or two in the smooth places." No sooner thought upon than done. I lay down flat, and every now and again gave a weak stroke to turn the boat's head to the shore.</p>

<p>It was very tiring, and slow work, yet I did gain some distance. As we drew near the Cape of the Woods, I saw that I must miss that point. But I was, indeed, close in. I could see the cool, green tree-tops moving in the wind, and I felt sure I should reach the next cape without fail.</p>

<p>It was indeed time, for I suffered terrible thirst. The glow of the sun from above, the glimmer of it from the waves, the sea-water that fell and dried upon me, whitening my lips with salt&#151;all these made my throat and my head burn. The sight of the trees so near made me sick with desire. But I was carried past the cape; and as the next bay opened out, I beheld a sight which changed the nature of my thoughts.</p>

<p>Right in front of me, not half a mile away, I beheld the <i>Hispaniola</i> under sail. I made sure, of course, that I should be taken; but I was so thirsty that I scarcely knew whether to be glad or sorry at the thought; and, long before I had decided, surprise had taken entire possession of my mind, and I could do nothing but gaze and wonder.</p>

<p>When I first caught sight of the <i>Hispaniola</i>, her sails were full and she was running on a course to the north-west, and I thought that the men were sailing the ship back to where she had come from. But soon she began to turn more and more towards the west; so I thought they had seen me and were going to give chase. Then, at last, she turned face to face with the wind and lay there helpless.</p>

<p>"Fools," said I; "they must still be drunk." And I thought how Captain Smollett would have dealt with them.</p>

<p>Then the vessel turned again and sailed off in another direction. This way and that, up and down, north, south, east, west, the <i>Hispaniola</i> sailed, and each time ended as she had begun, head on to the wind, with empty sails. It became plain to me that no one was guiding her. And, if so, where were the men? Either they were drunk, or they had deserted her, I thought; and perhaps if I could get on board I might return the vessel to her captain.</p>

<p>Up I got, and set myself, with all my strength and care, to row after the <i>Hispaniola</i>. Once I took in such a quantity of water that I had to stop and throw it out; but in time I got more used to the work and guided my boat among the waves, with only now and then a blow upon her side and a dash of water in my face.</p>

<p>I was now gaining rapidly on the ship; and still no one appeared on her. I could only suppose that she was deserted. If not, the men were lying drunk below, where I might shut them in perhaps, and do what I chose with the ship.</p>

<p>For some time she continued to run away from me. But at last I had my chance. The wind fell, for a few moments, very low; and the <i>Hispaniola</i> turned slowly round. The rear of the ship came towards me, with the window still open, and the lamp still burning on in the daylight.</p>

<p>I drew nearer, and was not a hundred yards from her when the wind came again. The sails filled and off she went. Then round she came yet again, sideways on to me; then round again till she had covered half to three-quarters of the distance that separated us. I could see the waves boiling white beneath her. Hugely tall she looked to me from my low station in the boat.</p>

<p>And then, of a sudden, I began to understand. I had scarce time to think&#151;scarce time to act and save myself. I was on the top of one wave when the ship came leaping over the next. It towered over my head. I sprang up, pushing the boat under water with my feet. I seized one of the ship's ropes and found a place for my feet. And, as I still hung there breathless, the sound of a blow told me that the ship had charged down upon and struck the boat, and I was left upon the <i>Hispaniola</i>&#151;without a hope of escape.</p>
