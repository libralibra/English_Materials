<p class="chapter">CHAPTER I</p>

<p class="storyTitle">Oliver Twist is Born</p>

<p>Oliver Twist was born in a workhouse, and for a long time after his birth there was considerable doubt whether the child would live. He lay breathless for some time, rather unequally balanced between this world and the next. After a few struggles, however, he breathed, sneezed and uttered a loud cry.</p>

<p>The pale face of a young woman lying on the bed was raised weakly from the pillow and in a faint voice she said, "Let me see the child and die."</p>

<p>"Oh, you must not talk about dying yet," said the doctor, as he rose from where he was sitting near the fire and advanced towards the bed.</p>

<p>"God bless her, no!" added the poor old pauper who was acting as nurse.</p>

<p>The doctor placed the child in its mother's arms; she pressed her cold white lips on its forehead; passed her hands over her face; gazed wildly around, fell backâ€”and died.</p>

<p>"It's all over," said the doctor at last.</p>

<p>"Ah, poor dear, so it is!" said the old nurse.</p>

<p>"She was a good-looking girl, too," added the doctor; "where did she come from?"</p>

<p>"She was brought here last night," replied the old woman. "She was found lying in the street. She had walked some distance, for her shoes were torn to pieces; but where she came from, or where she was going, nobody knows."</p>

<p>"The old story," said the doctor, shaking his head, as he leaned over the body, and raised the left hand; "no wedding-ring, I see. Ah! Good night!"</p>
