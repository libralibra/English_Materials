<p class="chapter">CHAPTER XX</p>

<p class="storyTitle">Bill Sikes is Ill</p>

<p>On the next evening Bill Sikes, awakening from a short sleep, angrily enquired what time of night it was.</p>

<p>"Not long gone seven," said Nancy. "How do you feel tonight, Bill?"</p>

<p>"As weak as water," replied Mr. Sikes. "Here, lend me a hand and help me to get off this bed."</p>

<p>Illness had not improved Mr. Sikes's temper, for, as the girl raised him up and led him to a chair, he cursed her awkwardness and struck her.</p>

<p>The room in which they were was not the one they had lived in before the attempted robbery at Chertsey, although it was in the same part of the town. It was a small, poorly furnished room, overlooking a narrow, dirty lane. It was evident that Mr. Sikes and Nancy now lived in a state of extreme poverty.</p>

<p>"Don't be too hard upon me tonight, Bill," said the girl putting her hand upon his shoulder.</p>

<p>"Why not?" cried Sikes.</p>

<p>"Such a number of nights," said the girl, with a touch of womanly tenderness, "I have been nursing and caring for you, as if you had been a child. And this is the first night that I've seen you better and like yourself. You wouldn't have treated me as you did just now if you'd thought of that, would you? Come, come; say you wouldn't."</p>

<p>"Well, then," replied Mr. Sikes, "I wouldn't. But don't stand crying there. You won't affect me with your woman's nonsense."</p>

<p>At that moment Fagin appeared at the door, followed by the Artful Dodger and Charlie Bates.</p>

<p>"Why, what evil wind has blown you here?" said Mr. Sikes to Fagin.</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Fagin, rubbing his hands with great satisfaction. "You're better, Bill, I can see."</p>

<p>"Better!" exclaimed Mr. Sikes. "I might have been dead twenty times over before you'd have done anything to help me. What do you mean by leaving a man in this state three weeks and more, you false-hearted villain? If it hadn't been for the girl I might have died."</p>

<p>"There now, Bill," said Fagin, eagerly catching at the word. "If it hadn't been for the girl! Who but poor old Fagin was the means of your having such a useful girl about you?"</p>

<p>"He says true enough there!" said Nancy.</p>

<p>"Oh, well," said Mr. Sikes to the Jew, "but I must have some money from you tonight."</p>

<p>"I haven't a piece of coin about me," replied the Jew.</p>

<p>"But you've got lots at home," said Sikes, "and I must have some from there."</p>

<p>"Lots!" cried Fagin, holding up his hands. "I haven't so much as would&#151;"</p>

<p>"I don't know how much you've got," said Sikes; "but I must have some tonight."</p>

<p>"Well, well," said Fagin, with a sigh. "I'll send the Artful presently."</p>

<p>"You won't do anything of the kind," replied Mr. Sikes. "Nancy shall go and get it, to make all sure; and I'll lie down and have a short sleep while she's gone."</p>

<p>The Jew then took leave of Sikes and returned home, accompanied by Nancy and the boys.</p>

<p>In due course they arrived at Fagin's house. The Jew sent the boys away from the room and then said to Nancy: "I'll go and get you that money, Nancy. This is only the key of a little cupboard where I keep a few odd things the boys get, my dear. I never lock up my money, for I've got none to lock up, my dear. It's a poor trade, Nancy; and no thanks; but I'm fond of seeing the young people about me; and I bear it all, I bear it all. Hush!" he said hastily, concealing the key in his breast, "who's that? Listen!"</p>

<p>The visitor, coming hastily into the room, was close upon the girl before he observed her.</p>

<p>It was Monks.</p>

<p>"Only one of my young people," said Fagin, observing that Monks drew back, on seeing a stranger. Then pointing upward, he took Monks out of the room.</p>

<p>Before the sound of their footsteps had ceased to echo through the house the girl had slipped off her shoes; then she softly ascended the stairs and was lost in the gloom above.</p>

<p>The room remained deserted for a quarter of an hour or more; the girl glided back softly, and immediately afterwards the two men were heard descending. Monks went at once into the street; and Fagin crawled upstairs again for the money. When he returned, the girl was preparing to go.</p>

<p>"Why, Nance," exclaimed the Jew, starting back as he put down the candle, "how pale you are!"</p>

<p>With a sigh for every piece of money, Fagin counted the amount into her hand, and they parted without more conversation. When the girl got into the open street, she sat down upon a doorstep; and seemed, for a few moments, wholly amazed and unable to pursue her way. Suddenly she arose and hurrying on she soon reached the dwelling where she had left the housebreaker.</p>

<p>Sikes did not observe the agitated condition in which she was. He merely inquired if she had brought the money, and receiving a reply in the affirmative he uttered a growl of satisfaction and resumed the sleep which her arrival had interrupted.</p>
