<p class="chapter">CHAPTER XII</p>

<p class="storyTitle">Oliver is to Take Part in a Robbery</p>

<p>About noon next day, when the Dodger and Bates had gone out, Mr. Fagin gave Oliver a long lecture on the ungratefulness he showed in trying to run away from his friends. He told him how he had taken him in and given him shelter and protection without which he might have died of hunger. He also told him the story of another young lad whom Fagin had caused to be hanged because he had tried to inform the police.</p>

<p>Little Oliver's blood ran cold, as he listened to the Jew's words and imperfectly understood the dark threats they carried.</p>

<p>The Jew, smiling in an ugly manner, patted Oliver on the head and said that if he kept quiet and did what he was told to do they would be very good friends yet. Then, taking his hat and covering himself with an old overcoat, he went out and locked the room-door behind him.</p>

<p>And so Oliver remained that day, and for the greater part of many days after it, seeing nobody between early morning and midnight, and left during the long hours to his own sad thoughts.</p>

<p>One cold, damp, windy night the old Jew wrapped himself tightly in his overcoat and, pulling the collar up over his ears so as to hide completely the lower part of his face, left his den. He walked along the dark muddy streets until he came to where Bill Sikes lived.</p>

<p>The dog growled as the Jew touched the handle of the room-door; and Bill demanded who was there.</p>

<p>"Only me, Bill; only me, my dear," said the Jew, looking in.</p>

<p>"Come in, then," said Sikes. "Lie down, you stupid brute. Don't you know the devil when he's got a great-coat on? Well!"</p>

<p>"Well, my dear," replied the Jew. "Ah! Nancy." The young lady, who was sitting by the fire, told him to draw up a chair.</p>

<p>"It <em>is</em> cold, Nancy dear," said the Jew, as he warmed his skinny hands over the fire. "It seems to go right through one," added the old man, touching his side.</p>

<p>"Give him something to drink, Nancy. Now then, I'm ready; say what you've got to say."</p>

<p>"About the house at Chertsey. When is it to be done, Bill? When is it to be done? Such silver, my dear, such silver!" said the Jew, rubbing his hands.</p>

<p>"Toby Crackit has been hanging about the place for a fortnight, and he can't get one of the servants to help us. The old lady has had them these twenty years, and if you were to give them five hundred pounds, they wouldn't be in it."</p>

<p>"It's a sad thing," said the Jew, "to lose so much when we had set our hearts upon it."</p>

<p>"So it is," said Sikes. "Worse luck!"</p>

<p>After a long silence Sikes suddenly said: "Fagin, will you give me fifty pounds extra, if it's safely done from the outside?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said the Jew.</p>

<p>"Then," said Sikes, "let it come off as soon as you like. Toby and me were over the garden-wall last night, to examine the door and the shutters. The house is barred up at night like a prison; but there's one part we can break through safely."</p>

<p>"Which is that, Bill?" asked the Jew eagerly.</p>

<p>"Never mind which part it is," said Sikes. "You can't do it without me, I know; but it's best to be on the safe side when one deals with you."</p>

<p>"As you like, my dear, as you like," replied the Jew. "Is there no help wanted, but yours and Toby's?"</p>

<p>"None," said Sikes, "except a boy; you must find us a little boy."</p>

<p>"Oliver's the boy for you, my dear," replied the Jew in a whisper. "He's been in good training these last few weeks, and it's time he began to work for his bread. Besides, the others are all too big."</p>

<p>"Well, he is just the size I want," said Mr. Sikes.</p>

<p>"And will do everything you want, Bill, my dear," interrupted the Jew, "if you frighten him enough."</p>

<p>"Frighten him!" repeated Sikes. "If he doesn't obey, you won't see him alive again, Fagin. Think of that, before you send him. Mark my words."</p>

<p>"I've thought of it all," said the Jew. "I've had my eye upon him, my dears. Once let him feel that he is one of us; once fill his mind with the idea that he has been a thief, and he's ours! Ours for his life."</p>

<p>"When is it to be done?" asked Nancy.</p>

<p>"I planned with Toby, the night after tomorrow," replied Sikes, "if he heard nothing from me to the contrary."</p>

<p>"Good," said the Jew; "there's no moon."</p>

<p>"No," replied Sikes. "You'd better bring the boy here tomorrow night. I shall leave here an hour after daybreak. All you'll have to do is to hold your tongue and keep the melting pot ready."</p>

<p>After some discussion it was decided that Nancy should go to the Jew's house next evening and bring Oliver away with her, Fagin observing that the boy would be more willing to accompany the girl who had so recently interfered on his behalf, than anybody else.</p>

<p>He looked closely at Nancy before he took his leave. Then he returned to his gloomy house where the Dodger was sitting up, awaiting his return.</p>
