<p class="chapter">CHAPTER XIX</p>

<p class="storyTitle">A Meeting at Night</p>

<p>It was a dull, rainy summer evening when Mr. and Mrs. Bumble, turning out of the main street of the town, directed their course towards a group of ruined houses, about a mile and a half away from it, built on a low unhealthy swamp bordering upon the river.</p>

<p>In the heart of this group of buildings, and bordering the river, stood a larger building, formerly used as a factory of some kind, but it had long since gone to ruin. It was before this decayed building that Mr. and Mrs. Bumble stopped.</p>

<p>"The place should be somewhere here," said Bumble, consulting a scrap of paper he held in his hand.</p>

<p>"Hallo there!" cried a voice from above. "Stand still a minute. I'll be with you directly."</p>

<p>Presently a small door opened and Monks signalled them inwards.</p>

<p>"Come in!" he cried impatiently, stamping his foot upon the ground. "Don't keep me here!"</p>

<p>The woman, who had hesitated at first, walked boldly in, followed, rather unwillingly, by Mr. Bumble. Monks led the way up a ladder to another floor above and hastily closed the door of the room in which they were. Then he lowered a lantern which hung at the end of a rope and which cast a dim light upon an old table and three chairs that were placed beneath it.</p>

<p>"Now," said Monks, when they had all three seated themselves, "the sooner we come to our business the better for all. The woman knows what it is, does she?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Bumble said that she was perfectly acquainted with it.</p>

<p>"He is right in saying that you were with this old nurse the night she died, and that she told you something&#151;"</p>

<p>"About the mother of the boy you named," replied Mrs. Bumble, interrupting him. "Yes."</p>

<p>"The first question is, of what nature was her information?" said Monks.</p>

<p>"That's the second," observed the woman with much determination. "The first is, what may the information be worth?"</p>

<p>"Who the devil can tell that, without knowing of what kind it is?" asked Monks.</p>

<p>"Nobody better than you, I am sure," answered Mrs. Bumble.</p>

<p>"How much do you want?" asked Monks sternly.</p>

<p>"What's it worth to you?" asked the woman coolly.</p>

<p>"It may be nothing; it may be twenty pounds," replied Monks. "Speak out, and let me know which."</p>

<p>"Add five pounds to the sum you have named, give me five-and-twenty pounds in gold," said the woman, "and I'll tell you all I know. Not before."</p>

<p>"What if I pay it for nothing?" asked Monks, hesitating.</p>

<p>"You can easily take it away again," replied the woman. "I am but a woman; alone here; and unprotected."</p>

<p>"Not alone, my dear, nor unprotected either," said Mr. Bumble, in a voice trembling with fear. "I am here, my dear."</p>

<p>"You are a fool," said Mrs. Bumble in reply, "and had better hold your tongue."</p>

<p>Mr. Monks thrust his hand into a side-pocket and, producing a canvas bag, counted out twenty-five gold pounds on the table and pushed them over to the woman.</p>

<p>"Now," he said, "gather them up and let's hear your story."</p>

<p>"When this woman, the woman we called Old Sally, died," Mrs. Bumble began, "she and I were alone, I stood beside the body when death came over it. She spoke of a young woman who had brought a child into the world some years before. The child was the one you named to him last night," said the woman, nodding carelessly towards her husband; "the mother was robbed by the nurse."</p>

<p>"In life?" asked Monks.</p>

<p>"In death," replied Mrs. Bumble. "She stole from the dead body something which the dead mother had prayed her, with her last breath, to keep for the child's sake." </p>

<p>"She sold it?" cried Monks desperately; "did she sell it? Where? When? To whom? How long ago?"</p>

<p>"As she told me, with great difficulty, that she had done this," said the woman, "she fell back and died."</p>

<p>"Without saying more?" cried Monks, furiously. "It's a lie! I'll not be played with. She said more. I'll tear the life out of you both, but I'll know what it was."</p>

<p>"She didn't utter another word," said the woman, to all appearance unmoved by the strange man's violence; "but she clutched my gown violently with one hand, which was partly closed; and when I saw that she was dead and removed the hand by force, I found it held a bit of jewellery."</p>

<p>"Where is it now?"asked Monks quickly.</p>

<p>"There," replied the woman, and she threw upon the table a small leather bag which Monks tore open with trembling hands. It contained a little gold locket, in which were two locks of hair, and a plain gold wedding ring.</p>

<p>"And is this all?" said Monks, after carefully examining the contents of the little packet.</p>

<p>"All," replied the woman. "Is that what you expected to get from me?"</p>

<p>"It is," replied Monks.</p>

<p>"What do you propose to do with it? Can it be used against me?"</p>

<p>"Never," replied Monks; "nor against me either. See here! But don't move a step forward, or your life is not worth a straw."</p>

<p>With these words he suddenly pushed the table aside, and, pulling an iron ring in the boards of the floor, threw back a large trap-door which opened at Mr. Bumble's feet, and caused that gentleman to retire several steps backward with great haste.</p>

<p>"Look down," said Monks, lowering the lantern through the opening. "Don't fear me. I could have let you down, quietly enough, when you were seated over it, if that had been my intention."</p>

<p>Thus encouraged, Mr. and Mrs. Bumble drew near to the edge of the opening; the muddy water, swollen by the heavy rain, was rushing rapidly on below.</p>

<p>Monks drew the little packet from his breast, where he had hurriedly thrust it, and, tying it to a piece of lead, dropped it into the stream. It fell straight into the water and was gone.</p>

<p>The three looking into each other's faces seemed to breathe more freely.</p>

<p>"There!" said Monks, closing the trap-door. "Light your lantern, and get away from here as fast as you can.</p>

<p>Mr. Bumble lighted his lantern and descended the ladder in silence, followed by his wife, and Monks brought up the rear.</p>

<p>They crossed the lower room slowly, and with caution, for Monks started at every shadow; and Mr. Bumble, holding his lantern a foot above the ground, looked nervously about him for hidden trap-doors. The gate at which they had entered was softly unfastened and opened by Monks, and the married couple emerged into the wet and darkness outside.</p>
