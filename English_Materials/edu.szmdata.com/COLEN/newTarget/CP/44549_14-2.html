<p class="storyTitle">Passage 14</p>



<p>Throughout the history of mankind, people have been asking, "Can it really happen?" The question was asked when people first thought of going out on the oceans. It was asked when Columbus set out on his journey, and as Marco Polo set sail. People thought the ships would drop off the edge of the world.</p>

<p>In the 1960's when astronauts made plans to reach the moon, many people believed it could never happen. But men did walk on the Moon, and they rode across the surface in Moon cars.</p>

<p>And what about space colonies? Can they really happen? The answer is a strong yes. Space colonies can be built. Right now engineers have the knowledge needed to get started.</p>

<p>Space colonization is in our future. It offers endless opportunities for people to expand. There are resources in space&#151;endless energy, materials in the Moon and the asteroids, the advantages of weightlessness and a high vacuum.</p>

<p>The opening of the space colony will be exciting. It will challenge the entire world. Each nation will be working on something outside its boundaries and people from all corners of the world will be deeply involved in the most exciting adventure that mankind has ever attempted.</p>

<p>Nations with the most advanced knowledge of electronics and the most industries will take the lead, but probably many countries will contribute scientists and engineers. Early space colonists will come from all over the world. Space colonies will bring people together for a great international effort. They may be a strong force for peace among all nations.</p>

<p>Life in a space colony should be very satisfying. People will have a high standard of living&#151;a pleasant home, plenty of food, unlimited energy, and challenging opportunities.</p>

<p>Many people from the Earth may prefer to live in space colonies, where the weather can be controlled, days can be made longer or shorter, and seasons can be adjusted to please the population. A person can be weightless, if desired, or live in a region where there is gravity, in surroundings more like these of Earth itself.</p>

<p>Each colony will have its own managers and engineers&#151;people responsible for the operation of the colony. And each person will have a sense of responsibility, an essential part to play in the success of the colony.</p>

<p>One thing is certain that in the future fundamentally new things will be happening. The only way to explore it is to use your imagination.</p>
