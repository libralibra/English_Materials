<p class="skillTitle">Skimming for gist</p>
<p>Skimming refers to the process of reading only for the gist (or main ideas) within a passage to get an overall impression of the content of a reading selection. It is usually done at a speed three to four times faster than normal reading. When skimming you ignore the details and only look for the gist. Readers may skim for the gist by:</p>
<ul>
	<li>looking at the title, subtitles, subheadings, and illustrations (if any) to predict the topic of the passage</li>
	<li>glancing quickly through the first (or first few) and the last (or last few) paragraphs to identify the general topic of the passage</li>
	<li>spotting key words carrying clues of the passage</li>
	<li>identifying signal words concerning the development of the ideas</li>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">1</span> I remember when I first found out that I had been accepted via Early Action to Stanford University. I was in the car when the email popped up in my inbox letting me know I had gotten into my dream school, and I burst into tears of pure joy. I spent the next few months imagining myself as a Cardinal, and preparing myself to accept their invitation.</p>

	</p>
	<p>
		<i>Early Action</i> is a type of early admissions process for admission to colleges
		and universities in the United States. Unlike the regular admissions process, Early
		Action usually requires students to submit an application by November 1 of their
		senior year of high school instead of January 1. Students are notified of the school's
		decision by mid-December instead of April 1.

</div>


<p class="z"><span class="lN">2</span> However, when the remaining admissions decisions came out, words can't begin to describe the excitement I felt when I learned that I was also accepted to Harvard University. Thus, I faced one of the toughest decisions in choosing between Stanford and Harvard.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">3</span> I decided to visit both campuses before making my final decision, and to my surprise, fell in love with Harvard. I had been so set on becoming a Cardinal that I hadn't given serious thought to the possibility of going somewhere else. As soon as I set foot in Harvard, everything felt right. The campus, the classes, the people, all made me realize there was no place else I wanted to spend the next four years.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">4</span> After I enrolled at Harvard, I was eager to start the next phase of my life, but anxious at the thought of being across the country so far from home. Saying my goodbyes to my family and friends made me fully aware of my newfound independence. I had no idea what to expect, and I feared that I would be lost at such a prestigious institution.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">5</span> One semester later, I have to say that I have made the best decision of my life. I have found my home, and I have become part of the Harvard community in so many different ways.</p>



<p class="z"><span class="lN">6</span> In a few short months, if I've learned anything, it's that college is far from easy. Academics are harder than ever, but I have the freedom to study whatever concentration interests me. I applied as a pre-med student, but this semester has shown me that there are virtually limitless options to explore before declaring my major next year.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">7</span> Classes often consist of lectures by professors together with smaller sections taught by graduate students, and supplemental student study groups. Collaboration in study groups is a huge part of surviving Harvard's tough academic load. If I ever felt overloaded, I only had to walk down the stairs to see my proctor, or set up a meeting with my academic adviser.</p>

		<i>Proctor</i> has two completely different meanings in education: it can refer either to a high official in certain universities, or to any teacher or other staff member at a university, secondary school or even elementary school when they are supervising the administration of a test or examination. In British, Canadian, Australian and South African English, persons acting in this latter capacity are referred to as <i>invigilators</i>.

	<p class="entryContents">
		academic adviser
	</p>
	<p>
		<i>Academic advisors</i> help students recognize and achieve their educational goals, primarily at the postsecondary level. They help students examine school programs, recognize their academic strengths and select a major. They also work closely with professors and other university administrators and stay up-to-date on program changes. See <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_advising"><i>academic advising</i></a> for more detail.

<p class="z"><span class="lN">8</span> This past December brought long, comprehensive exams that make up finals period, but Harvard's reading period, a dead week with no classes, was certainly a nice change from high school. There was even a <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primal_Scream_(Harvard)">Primal Scream</a> to kick off finals week, with hundreds of stark-naked Harvard students <a target="_blank" href="extras/HARVARD%20PRIMAL%20SCREAM.html">running</a> around the Yard at midnight in a time-old tradition.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">9</span> Outside class, I'm part of Harvard's Crimson Dance Team (CDT). CDT has the perfect blend of dance and spirit. Having danced competitively in the past, I was looking to renew my passion and was thrilled to discover that CDT would compete at nationals in Disney World this January.</p>

<div class="aboutContentsBorder">

<p class="z"><span class="lN">10</span> As Senior Class President at Dublin High School, I loved being a part of the leadership team and wanted to find an avenue to continue leadership in college. The First Year Social Committee (FYSC) was exactly what I was looking for. Our first event, Fright Fest, was a Halloween costume catwalk and dance. It was a huge success, with over 1,000 members of our class attending!</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">11</span> One of the best things Harvard has to offer is its diversity. I've already met so many incredible people from all over the world, and many of my closest friends are international students from places like Macedonia, Switzerland, Germany, and Greece. Listening to them makes me keen to study abroad in the future. Every single person here has the drive to learn and succeed, and I need only look across my classroom to find inspiration.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">12</span> This year, I live in a suite with four other girls from all over the country and abroad. We live in the Wigglesworth Hall dorm, which is at the edge of Harvard Yard, where all the freshmen live. Luckily, we're closest to the Lamont and Widener libraries, where you'll find students at all hours studying for the next exam or passed out on a desk! Our window overlooks Massachusetts Avenue, in the heart of Harvard Square. There you can find the Starbucks frequented by yours truly, the Chinese and pizza places open for late-night munchies, and the Coop, where we buy all of our books and school supplies. What's great about Harvard and its surrounding area is that everything is so accessible. Annenberg, our beautiful Hogwarts-like dining hall, is only a few minutes away from the Yard and the majority of my classes are held within the Yard and the Science Center right outside, so I can walk everywhere.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">13</span> Every morning I wake up at Harvard, I think to myself how blessed I am to be here. Being at Harvard can be overwhelming, but there is no other place I'd rather be.</p>
