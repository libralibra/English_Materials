<p class="z"><span class="lN">1</span> It can be a difficult time. Suddenly, perhaps for the first time in your life, you're moving away from everything familiar to you&#151;family, friends, home, community&#151;and beginning to make your way as a young adult entirely surrounded by strangers, in a new setting. You may feel that everything is on the line: your ability to succeed at college-level work, to build adult relationships, and to adapt to a lot of change all at once.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">2</span> According to a recent <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ucla.edu/">UCLA</a> study, more than 30 percent of college freshmen reported feeling overwhelmed a great deal of the time during the beginning of college, and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.jhu.edu/">Johns Hopkins University</a> reported that more than 40 percent of a recent freshman class sought help from the student counseling center. So understand that if you're feeling pressure and stress, you're not alone.</p>

<p class="subTitle">Helping Yourself</p>
<p class="z"><span class="lN">3</span> Many college students have minor problems adjusting to their new environment. Here are a few ideas that can help you manage your feelings of pressure and stress:</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">4</span> <i>Better plan your use of time.</i> Make time every day to prioritize your work. Prioritizing can give you a sense of control over what you must do, and a sense that you can do it.</p>
<div class="aboutContentsBorder">
	<p class="firstEntryContents">
		prioritize
	</p>
	<p>
		to put several things, problems etc in order of importance, so that you can deal with the most important ones first
	</p>
	<p class="entryContents">
		sense
	</p>
	<p>
		a feeling about something
	</p>
</div>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">5</span> <i>Plan your work and sleep schedules.</i> Too many students defer doing important classwork until late at night, work through much of the night, and start each new day exhausted. Constant fatigue can be a critical trigger for depression. Seven or eight hours of sleep a night is important to your well-being.</p>
<div class="aboutContentsBorder">
	<p class="firstEntryContents">
		defer
	</p>
	<p>
		to arrange for something to happen at a later time than you had planned
	</p>
	<p class="entryContents">
		trigger
	</p>
	<p>
		something that produces an immediate result
	</p>
	<p class="entryContents">
		well-being
	</p>
	<p>
		the satisfactory state that someone or something should be in, that involves such things as being happy, healthy, and safe, and having enough money
	</p>
</div>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">6</span> <i>Join an extracurricular activity.</i> Sports, theatre, Greek life, the student newspaper&#151;whatever interests you&#151;can bring opportunities to meet people interested in the same things you are, and it provides a welcome change from classwork.</p>
<p class="z"><span class="lN">7</span> <i>Make a friend.</i> Sometimes this may be a roommate or someone you meet in class or in the cafeteria. Friendships can help make a strange place feel more friendly and comfortable.</p>
<p class="z"><span class="lN">8</span> <i>Try relaxation methods.</i> These include meditation, deep breathing, warm baths, long walks, exercise&#151;whatever you enjoy that lessens your feelings of stress or discomfort.</p>
<div class="aboutContentsBorder">
	<p class="firstEntryContents">
		meditation
	</p>
	<p>
		quiet thought that helps you to relax or that is intended as a spiritual or religious exercise
	</p>
</div>


<p class="z"><span class="lN">9</span> <i>Take time for yourself each day.</i> Make this special time&#151;even if it's only 15 minutes by yourself&#151;a period where you think about your feelings and dreams. Focusing on yourself can be energizing and gives a feeling of purposefulness and control over life.</p>
<div class="aboutContentsBorder">
	<p class="firstEntryContents">
		energize
	</p>
	<p>
		to make someone feel full of energy or enthusiasm; to make someone feel more determined and energetic
	</p>
</div>

<p class="subTitle"><a name="Developmental Tasks of College Students"></a>Developmental Tasks of College Students</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">10</span> <i>Achieving competence.</i> This involves the development of intellectual, emotional, cognitive, behavioral, and social abilities as well as physical and manual skills.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">11</span> <i>Managing emotions.</i> The young adult's initial task is to become aware of personal feelings and to recognize that they provide information relevant to contemplated behavior or to decisions about future plans. As a larger range of feelings is fully acknowledged and expressed in appropriate ways, new and more useful patterns of expression and control can be achieved.</p>
<div class="aboutContentsBorder">
	<p class="firstEntryContents">
		contemplate
	</p>
	<p>
		to look at or view with continued attention; observe or study thoughtfully; to consider thoroughly; think fully or deeply about
	</p>
	<p>
		<i>Contemplate</i> is used with these nouns as the object: death, fate, future, meaning, move, mystery, retirement, suicide
	</p>
</div>




<p class="z"><span class="lN">12</span> <i>Becoming autonomous.</i> Mature autonomy requires both emotional independence (freedom from continual and pressing needs for reassurance and approval) and instrumental independence (the ability to structure one's life and master the environment in ways that allow for mobilization to satisfy one's daily needs, carry on activities, and cope with problems without extensive direction or support from others). Simultaneously, the individual must accept interdependence, recognizing the reciprocal nature of the relationship between the individual and his/her community, that one cannot receive benefits from a social structure without contributing to it and that personal rights have a corollary social responsibility.</p>
<div class="aboutContentsBorder">
	<p class="firstEntryContents">
		autonomy
	</p>
	<p>
		the ability or opportunity to make your own decisions without being controlled by anyone else <span class="syn">syn</span>  independence

	<p>

	</p>
</div>


<p class="z"><span class="lN">13</span> <i>Establishing identity.</i> Identity is confidence in one's ability to maintain inner sameness and continuity; to reach this stage, one must understand one's physical needs, characteristics, and personal appearance and be sure of sexual identification and appropriate roles and behavior.</p>


<p class="z"><span class="lN">14</span> <i>Freeing interpersonal relationships.</i> As one matures, one should be able to express greater trust, interdependence, and individuality in relationships so that one may feel less need to conform to the standards of friends or to conceal shortcomings or disagreements. Developing tolerance for a wide range of persons is a significant aspect of this task which involves respect and acceptance of those of different backgrounds, beliefs, cultures, races, lifestyles, and appearances.</p>
<div class="aboutContentsBorder">
	<p class="firstEntryContents">
		conform
	</p>
	<p>
		to behave in the way that most other people in your group or society behave <b>conform to/with</b>
	</p>
</div>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">15</span> <i>Establishing and clarifying purposes.</i> To develop purposes, an individual must formulate plans and priorities for a healthy lifestyle conducive to well-being that integrate establishing a personal direction and orientation in one's life that takes into account personal and ethical values, future relationship/family plans, cultural participation, career objectives and educational involvement, as well as leisure time interests.</p>

<p class="z"><span class="lN">16</span> <i>Developing integrity.</i> This task involves making one's values both more personal and more humane. One examines and selects a personally valid set of beliefs that have some internal consistency and provide a guide for behavior. At the same time one drops a literal belief in the absoluteness of rules and adopts a more relative view, and acts in accordance with these personal values.</p>
