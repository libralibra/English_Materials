Soon they will be together again, all the people who travel between their own lives and each other 's.
The package tour of the season will lure them this week to the family table.
By Thursday, feast day, family day, Thanksgiving day, Americans who value individualism like no other people will collect around a million tables in a ritual of belonging.
</p>
<p>
They will assemble their families the way they assemble dinner:
each one bearing a personality as different as cranberry sauce and pumpkin pie.
For one dinner they will cook for each other, fuss for each other, feed each other and argue with each other.
They will nod at their common heritage, the craziness and caring of other generations.
They will measure their common legacy&#151;the children.
</p>
<p>
All these complex cells, these men and women, old and young, with different dreams and disappointments will give homage again to the group they are a part of and apart from:
their family.
Families and individuals.
The "we" and the "I".
As good Americans we all travel between these two ideals.
We take value trips from the great American notion of individualism to the great American vision of family.
We wear out our tires driving back and forth, using speed to shorten the distance between these two principles.
</p>
<p>
There has always been some pavement between a person and a family.
From the first moment we recognize that we are separate we begin to wrestle with aloneness and togetherness.
Here and now these conflicts are especially acute.
We are, after all, raised in families&#160;... to be individuals.
This double message follows us through life.
We are taught about the freedom of the "I" and the safety of the "we."
The loneliness of the "I" and the intrusiveness of the "we".
The selfishness of the "I" and the burdens of the "we".
</p>
<p>
We are taught what Andre Malraux said:
 "Without a family, man, alone in the world, trembles with the cold."
And taught what he said another day:
 "The denial of the supreme importance of the mind's development accounts for many revolts against the family."
In theory, the world rewards "the supreme importance" of the individual, the ego.
We think alone, inside our heads.
We write music and literature with an enlarged sense of self.
We are graded and paid, hired and fired, on our own merit.
The rank individualism is both exciting and cruel.
Here is where the fittest survive.
</p>
<p>
The family, on the other hand, at its best, works very differently.
We don't have to achieve to be accepted by our families.
We just have to be.
Our membership is not based on credentials but on birth.
As Malraux put it, "A friend loves you for your intelligence, a mistress for your charm, but your family's love is unreasoning:
You were born into it and of its flesh and blood."
</p>
<p>
The family is formed not for the survival of the fittest but for the weakest.
It is not an economic unit but an emotional one.
This is not the place where people ruthlessly compete with each other but where they work for each other.
Its business is taking care, and when it works, it is not callous but kind.
</p>
<p>
There are fewer heroes, fewer stars in family life.
While the world may glorify the self, the family asks us;
at one time or another, to submerge it.
While the world may abandon us, the family promises, at one time or another, to protect us.
So we commute daily, weekly, yearly between one world and another.
Between a life as a family member that can be nurturing or smothering.
Between a life as an individual that can free us or flatten us.
We vacillate between two separate sets of demands and possibilities.
</p>
<p>
The people who will gather around this table Thursday live in both of these worlds, a part of and apart from each other.
With any luck the territory they travel from one to another can be a fertile one, rich with care and space.
It can be a place where the "I" and the "we" interact.
On this day at least, they will bring to each other something both special and something to be shared:
these separate selves.
