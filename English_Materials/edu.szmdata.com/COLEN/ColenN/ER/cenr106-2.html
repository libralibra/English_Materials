<p class="storyAuthor">
Patsy Neal
</p>
<p>
Almost all of us have seen pictures of old, homeless ladies, moving about the streets of big cities with everything they own stuffed into a bag or a paper sack.
</p>
<p>
My grandmother is 89 years old, and a few weeks ago I realized with a jolt that she, too, had become one of them.
Before I go any further, I had best explain that I did not see my grandmother's picture on TV. I discovered her plight during a face-to-face visit at my mother's house&#151;in a beautiful, comfortable, safe, middle-class environment with good china on the table and turkey and chicken on the stove.
</p>
<p>
My grandmother's condition saddened me beyond words, for an 89-year-old should not have to carry around everything she owns in a bag.
It's enough to be 89, without the added burden of packing the last fragments of your existence into a space big enough to accommodate only the minutest of treasures.
</p>
<p>
Becoming a bag lady was not something that happened to her overnight.
My grandmother has been in a nursing home these last several years;
at first going back to her own home for short visits, then less frequently as she became older and less mobile.
</p>
<p>
No matter how short these visits were, her greatest pleasure came from walking slowly around her home, touching every item lovingly and spending hours browsing through drawers and closets.
Then, I did not understand her need to search out all her belongings.
</p>
<p>
As she spent longer days and months at the nursing home, I could not help noticing other things.
She began to hide her possessions under the mattress, in her closet, under the cushion of her chair, in every conceivable, reachable space.
And she began to think that people were "stealing" from her.
</p>
<p>
Unsteady:
When a walker became necessary, my mother took the time to make a bag that could be attached to it, so that my grandmother could carry things around while keeping her hands on the walker.
I had not paid much attention to this bag until we went to the nursing home to take her home with us for our traditional Christmas Eve sharing of gifts.
</p>
<p>
As we left, my grandmother took her long, unsteady walk down the hallway, balancing herself with her walker, laboriously moving it ahead, one step at a time, until finally we were at the car outside.
Once she was safely seated, I picked up her walker to put it in the back.
I could barely lift it.
Then 1 noticed that the bag attached to it was bulging.
Something clicked, but it still wasn't complete enough to grasp.
</p>
<p>
At home in my mother's house, I was asked to get some photographs from my grandmother's purse.
Lifting her pocketbook, I was surprised again at the weight and bulk.
I watched as my mother pulled out an alarm clock, a flashlight, a small radio, thread, needles, pieces of sewing, a book and other items that seemed to have no reason for being in a pocketbook.
</p>
<p>
I looked at my grandmother, sitting bent over in her chair, rummaging through the bag on the walker, slowly pulling out one item and then another, and lovingly putting it back.
I looked down at her purse with all its disconnected contents and remembered her visits to her home, rummaging through drawers and through closets,
</p>
<p>
 "Oh, Lord," I thought with sudden insight.
 "That walker and that purse are her home now."
</p>
<p>
I began to understand that over the years my grandmother's space for living had diminished like melting butter&#151;from endless fields and miles of freedom as a child and young mother to, with age, the constrictions of a house, then a small room in a nursing home and finally to the tightly clutched handbag and the bag on her walker.
</p>
<p>
When the family sent her to a nursing home, it was the toughest decision it had ever had to make.
We all thought she would be secure there;
we would no longer have to worry about whether she had taken her medicine, or left her stove on, or was alone at night.
</p>
<p>
But we hadn't fully understood her needs.
Security for my grandmother was not in the warm room at the nursing home, with 24-hour attendants to keep her safe and well fed, nor in the family who visited and took her to visit in their homes.
In her mind her security was tied to those things she could call her own&#151;and over the years those possessions had dwindled away like sand dropping through an hourglass:
first her car, sold when her eyes became bad and she couldn't drive;
then some furnishings she didn't really need.
Later it was the dogs she had trouble taking care of.
And finally it would be her home when it became evident that she could never leave the nursing home again.
But as her space and mobility dwindled, so did her control over her life.
</p>
<p>
Dignity:
I looked at my grandmother again, sitting so alone before me, hair totally gray, limbs and joints swollen by arthritis, at the hearing aid that could no longer help her hear, and the glasses too thick but so inadequate in helping her to see&#160;... and yet there was such dignity about her.
A dignity I could not understand.
</p>
<p>
The next day, after my grandmother had been taken back to the nursing home and my mother was picking up in her room, she found a small scrap of paper my grandmother had scribbled these words on:
</p>
<p>
 "It is 1:30
tonight and I had to get up and go to the bathroom.
I cannot go back to sleep.
But I looked in on Margaret and she is sleeping so good, and Patsy is sleeping too."
</p>
<p>
With that note, I finally understood, and my 89-year-old bag-lady grandmother changed from an almost helpless invalid to a courageous, caring individual still very much in control of her environment.
</p>
<p>
What intense loneliness she must have felt as she scribbled that small note on that small piece of paper with the small bag on her walker and her small purse next to her.
Yet she chose to experience it alone rather than wake either of us from much-needed sleep.
Out of her own great need, she chose to meet our needs.
</p>
<p>
As I held that tiny note, and cried inside, I wondered if she dreamed of younger years and more treasured possessions and a bigger world when she went back to sleep that night.
I certainly hoped so.
