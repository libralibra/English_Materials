<p class="storyAuthor">
John Cheever
</p>
<p>
Born and brought up in Nascosta, a girl of seventeen, Clementina was asked to come to Rome by the baron, at whose place she was maid servant.
How could she say no when she had dreamed all the nights of her life of seeing the Pope with her own eyes and walking on streets that were lighted after dark with electricity?
</p>
<p>
In Rome she slept on straw and washed in a bucket, but the streets were a spectacle, although she had to work such hours that she was not often able to walk in the city.
The baron promised to pay her twelve thousand lire a month, but he paid her nothing at the end of the first month and nothing at the end of the second, and the cook said that he often brought girls in from the country and paid them nothing.
Opening the door for him one evening, she asked with great courtesy for her wages, and he said he had given her a room, a change of air, and a visit to Rome and that she was badly educated to ask for more.
She had no coat to wear in the street, and there were holes in her shoes, and all she was given to eat was the leftovers from the baron's table.
She saw that she would have to find another post, because she didn't have the money to go back to Nascosta.
That next week, the cousin of the cook said that some Americans needed a maid.
She put all the dirty dishes in the oven to give a false appearance of cleanliness, said her prayers in San Marcello 's, and flew across Rome to where the Americans lived, feeling that every girl on the street that night was looking for the same post.
The Americans were a family with two boys&#151;well-educated people, although she could see that they were sad and foolish.
They offered her twenty thousand lire in wages and showed her a very commodious room where she would live and said they hoped she would not be uncomfortable.
</p>
<p>
She had heard much about Americans, about how they were generous and ignorant, and some of this was true, for they were very generous and treated her like a guest in the house, always asking her if she had time to this and that and urging her to take a passage in the streets on Thursdays and Sundays.
</p>
<p>
She went with this American family to the mountains in July, and in August to Venice, and, coming back to Rome in the fall, she understood them to say that they were leaving Italy, and they had the trunks brought up from the cellar, and she helped the madam with the packing.
Now she had five pairs of shoes and eight dresses and money in the bank, but the thought of looking for another post with a Roman madam who might spit in her eye whenever she felt like it was discouraging, and one day when she was repairing a dress for the madam she became so discouraged that she cried.
Then she explained to the madam how hard the life of a maid was working for Romans, and the madam said they would take her to the new world if she liked.
They would take her for six months on an impermanent visa;
it would be diverting for her and a help for them.
Then all the arrangements were made, and she went to Nascosta, and the mamma cried and asked her not to go, and everyone in the village said she should not go, but this was jealousy, because they had never had a chance to go anywhere&#151;not even Conciliano.
And for once the world where she had lived and being so happy seemed to her truly to be an old world where the customs and the walls were older than the people, and she felt that she would be happier in a world where the walls were all new, even if the people were savage.
</p>
<p>
But on the morning when they sailed she felt a great sadness, for who can live out a good life but in his own country?
Then she told herself that it was only a voyage&#151;she would come home in six months&#151;and what had the good God made the world so strange and various for if it was not to be seen?
She had her passport stamped and went aboard the ship feeling very emotional.
It was an American ship, as cold as winter, and at lunch there was ice water on the table, and what was not cold was flavorless and badly cooked, and she came back to her deep feeling that, while these people were kind and generous, they were ignorant and, with all their money, they did not know any better than to eat platefuls of raw steak washed down with coffee that tasted like medicine.
They were not beautiful or elegant and they had pale eyes, but what disgusted her most on the ship were the old women, who in her country would be wearing black in memory of their numerous dead and, as suited their time of life, would move slowly and inspire dignity.
But here the old ladies spoke in shrill voices and wore bright clothes and as much jewelry, all of it false, as you find on the Madonna of Nascosta, and painted their faces and tinted their hair.
This must be a savage country where the old had no wisdom or taste and did not deserve or receive the respect of their children and their grandchildren and had forgotten their dead.
</p>
<p>
It was raining when they came up the Narrows.
They took a taxi and a train to Washington, the capital of the new world, and then another taxi, and she could see out of the window that all the buildings were copies of the buildings of Imperial Rome, and they looked ghostly to her in the night lights, as if the Forum had risen again from the dust.
They drove into the country, where the houses were all of wood and all new and where the washbasins and bathtubs were very commodious, and in the morning her madam showed her the machines and how to work them.
</p>
<p>
At first she was suspicious of the washing machine, for it used a fortune in soap and hot water and did not clean the clothes, and it reminded her of how happy she had been at the fountain in Nascosta, talking with her friends and making everything as clean as new.
But little by little the machine seemed to her more convenient for it was after all only a machine, and it filled itself and emptied itself and turned around and around, and it seemed marvelous to her that a machine could remember so much and was always there, ready and waiting to do its work.
And then there was the machine for washing the dishes, and you could wash the dishes in a costume for the evening without getting a drop of water on your gloves.
When the madam was away and the boys were at school, first she would put some dirty clothes in the washing machine and start that, and then she would put some dirty dishes in the other machine and start that, and then she would put a nice saltimbocca alia romana in the electric frying pan and start that, and then she would sit in the saloon in front of the TV and listen to all the machines around her doing the work, and it delighted her and made her feel powerful.
Then there was the fridge in the kitchen, making ice and keeping the butter as hard as stone, and there was the deep freeze full of iamb and beef as fresh as the day when they had been killed, and there was an electric egg beater, and a machine for squeezing the oranges, and a machine for breathing in the dust, and she would have them all going at once, and a machine for making the toast&#151;all bright silver&#151;where you put in the plain bread and turned your back and soon there were two pieces of toast just the color you had asked for, and all done by the machine.
</p>
<p>
Time went along quickly.
Her impermanent visa expired in April and she would have to go home.
She would go back, she thought.
She would take the boat, she would debark at Naples&#160;...&#160;
Her eyes filled with tears when she thought of kissing Mamma.
Then she would sit in the marketplace with such a ring of people around her as would form for an accident, speaking in her own tongue and drinking the wine they had made and talking about the new world.
She saw the scene distinctly, the fountain spray blowing on the wind, but then she saw gathering in the imagined faces of her townsmen a look of disbelief.
Who would believe her tales?
Who would listen?
They would have admired her if she had seen the devil, like Cousin Maria, but she had seen a sort of paradise and no one cared.
In leaving one world and coming to another she had lost both.
