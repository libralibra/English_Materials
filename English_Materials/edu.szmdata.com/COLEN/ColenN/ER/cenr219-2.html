<p>
My problem with country living began innocently enough when our well ran dry and a neighbor said some pump priming would be necessary.
</p>
<p>
 "I didn't come up here to discuss economics," I said.
Actually, I don't understand economics.
There's no use revealing that, though, to every Tom, Dick and Harry who interrupts his dinner to try to get your water running, so I said, "I come up here to get away from that sort of thing."
My neighbor gave me a puzzled look.
</p>
<p>
 "He's talking about the water pump," Alice told me.
 "It needs priming."
</p>
<p>
I thought that experience might have been just a fluke&#151;until, on a fishing trip with the same neighbor, I proudly pulled in a fish with what I thought was a major display of deep-sea angling skill, only to hear a voice behind me say, "It's just a fluke."
</p>
<p>
 "This is dangerous," I said to Alice, while helping her weed the vegetable garden the next day.
I had thought our problem was limited to the pump-priming ichthyologist down the road, but that morning at the post office I had overheard a farmer say that since we seemed to be in for a few days of good weather he intended to make his hay while the sun was shining.
 "These people are robbing me of aphorisms," I said, taking advantage of the discussion to rest for a while on my hoe.
 "How can I encourage the children to take advantage of opportunities by telling them to make hay while the sun shines if they think that means making hay while the sun shines?"
</p>
<p>
 "Could you please keep weeding those peas" while you talk," she said.
 "You've got a long row to hoe."
</p>
<p>
I began to look at Alice with new eyes.
By that, of course, I don't mean that I actually went to a discount eye outlet, acquired two new eyes (20/20 this time), replaced my old eyes with the new ones and looked at Alice.
Having to make that explanation is just the sort of thing I found troubling.
What I mean is that I was worried about the possibility of Alice's falling into the habit of rural literalism herself.
My concern was deepened a few days later by a conversation that took place while I was in one of our apple trees, looking for an apple that was not used as a dacha by the local worms.
 "I just talked to the Murrays, and they say that the secret is picking up windfalls," Alice said.
</p>
<p>
 "Windfalls?"
I said.
 "Could it be that Jim Murray has taken over Exxon since last time I saw him?
Or do the Murrays have a natural-gas operation in the back forty I didn't know about?"
 "Not those kinds of windfalls," Alice said.
 "The apples that fall from the tree because of the wind.
They're a breeding place for worms."
</p>
<p>
 "There's nothing wrong with our apples," I said reaching for a particularly plump one.
</p>
<p>
 "Be careful," she said.
 "You may be getting yourself too far out on a limb."
</p>
<p>
 "You may be getting yourself out on a limb yourself," I said to Alice at breakfast the next morning.
</p>
<p>
She looked around the room.
 "I'm sitting at the kitchen table," she said.
</p>
<p>
 "I meant it symbolically," I said.
 "The way it was meant to be meant.
This has got to stop.
I won't have you coming in from the garden with small potatoes in your basket and saying that what you found was just small potatoes.
 'Small potatoes' doesn't mean small potatoes."
</p>
<p>
 "Small potatoes doesn't mean small potatoes?"
</p>
<p>
 "I refuse to discuss it," I said.
 "The tide's in, so I'm going fishing, and I don't want to hear any encouraging talk about that fluke not being the only fish in the ocean."
</p>
<p>
 "I was just going to ask why you have to leave before you finish your breakfast," she said.
</p>
<p>
 "Because time and tide wait for no man,"" I said.
 "And I mean it."
</p>
<p>
Had she trapped me into saying that?
Or was it possible that I was falling into the habit myself?
Was I, as I waited for a bite, thinking that there were plenty of other fish in the sea?
Then I had a bite&#151;then another.
I forgot about the problem until after I had returned to the dock and done my most skillful job of filleting.
</p>
<p>
 "Look!"
I said, holding up the carcass of one fish proudly, as Alice approached the dock.
 "It's nothing but skin and bones."
</p>
<p>
The shock of realizing what I had said caused me to stumble against my fish-cleaning table and knock the fillets off the dock.
 "Now we won't have anything for dinner," I said.
</p>
<p>
 "Don't worry about it," Alice said.
 "I have other fish to fry."
</p>
<p>
 "That's not right!"
I shouted.
 "That's not what that means.
It means you have something better to do."
</p>
<p>
 "It can also mean that I have other fish to fry," she said.
 "And I do.
I'll just get that other fish you caught out of the freezer.
 'Even though it was just a fluke."
</p>
<p>
I tried to calm myself.
I apologized to Alice for shouting and offered to help her pick vegetables from the garden for dinner.
</p>
<p>
 "I'll try to watch my language," she said, as we stood among the peas.
</p>
<p>
 "It's all right, really," I said.
</p>
<p>
 "I was just going to say that tonight it seems rather slim pickings," she said.
 "Just about everything has gone to seed."
</p>
<p>
 "Perfectly all right," I said, wandering over toward the garden shed, where some mud seemed to be caked in the eaves.
I pushed at the mud with a rake, and a swarm of wasps burst out at me.
I ran for the house, swatting at wasps with my hat.
Inside, I suddenly had the feeling that some of them had managed to crawl up the legs of my jeans, and I tore the jeans off.
Alice found me there in the kitchen, standing quietly in what the English call their smalls.
</p>
<p>
 "That does it," I said.
 "We're going back to the city."
</p>
<p>
 "Just because of a few stings?"
</p>
<p>
 "Can't you see what happened?"
I said.
 "They scared the pants off me."
