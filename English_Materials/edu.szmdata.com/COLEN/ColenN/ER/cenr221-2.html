<p>
Last week I had for about the hundredth time an experience that always disturbs me.
Riding on a train, I found myself talking with my seat-mate, who asked me what I did for a living.
 "I teach English."
Do you have any trouble predicting his response?
His face fell, and he groaned, "Oh, dear, I'll have to watch my language."
In my experience there are only two other possible reactions.
The first is even less inspiriting:
 "I hated English in school;
it was my worst subject."
The second, so rare as to make an honest English teacher almost burst into tears of gratitude when it occurs, is an animated conversation about literature, or ideas, or the American language&#151;the kind of conversation that shows a continuing respect for "English" as something more than being sure about who and whom, lie and lay.
</p>
<p>
Unless the people you meet are a good deal more tactful or better liars than the ones I meet, you've had the two less favorable experiences many times.
And it takes no master analyst to figure out why so many of our fellow citizens think of us as unfriendly policemen:
it is because too many of us have seen ourselves as unfriendly policemen.
I know of a high school English class in Indiana in which the students are explicitly told that their paper grades will not be affected by anything they say;
required to write a paper a week, they are graded simply on the number of spelling and grammatical errors.
What is more, they are given a standard form for their papers:
each paper is to have three paragraphs, a beginning, a middle, and an end&#151;or is it an introduction, a body, and a conclusion?
The theory seems to be that if the student is not troubled about having to say anything, or about discovering a good way of saying it, he can then concentrate on the truly important matter of avoiding mistakes.
</p>
<p>
What's wrong with such assignments?
What's wrong with getting the problem of correctness focused sharply enough so that we can really work on it?
After all, we do have the job of teaching correct English, don't we?
We can't possibly teach our hordes of students to be colorful writers, but by golly, we can beat the bad grammar out of them.
Leaving aside the obvious fact that we can't beat the bad grammar out of them, not by direct assault, let's think a bit about what that kind of assignment does to the poor teacher who gives it.
Those papers must be read, by someone, and unless the teacher has more trained assistance than you and I have, she's the victim.
She can't help being bored silly by her own paper-reading, and we all know what an evening of being bored by a class's papers does to our attitude toward that class the next day.
The old formula of John Dewey was that any teaching that bores the student is likely to fail.
The formula was subject to abuse, quite obviously, since interest in itself is only one of many tests of adequate teaching.
A safer formula, though perhaps also subject to abuse, might be:
Any teaching that bores the teacher is sure to fail.
And I am haunted by the picture of that poor woman in Indiana, week after week reading batches of papers written by students who have been told that nothing they say can possibly affect her opinion of those papers&#160;...&#160;
</p>
<p>
As I try to sort out the various possible cures for those batches of boredom&#151;in ink, double-spaced, on one side of the sheet, only, please&#151;I find them falling into three groups:
efforts to give the students a sharper sense of writing to an audience, efforts to give them some substance to express, and efforts to improve their habits of observation and of approach to their task&#151;what might be called improving their mental personalities.
</p>
<p>
This classification, both obvious and unoriginal, is a useful one not only because it covers"&#151;at least I hope it does&#151;all of our efforts to improve what our students can do but also because it reminds us that no one of the three is likely to work unless it is related to each of the others.
In fact each of the three types of cure&#151;"develop an awareness of audience," "give them something to say," and "enliven their writing personalities"&#151;threatens us with characteristic dangers and distortions;
all three together are indispensable to any lasting cure&#160;...&#160;
</p>
<p>
Our students bore us, even when they take a seemingly lively controversial tone, because they have nothing to say, to us or to any body else.
If and when they discover something to say, they will no longer bore us, and our comments will no longer bore them.
Having something to say, they will be interested in learning how to say it better.
Having something to say, they can be taught how to give a properly controversial edge to what will by its nature be controversial&#151;nothing, after all, is worth saying that everybody agrees on already.
</p>
<p>
When we think of providing substance, we are perhaps tempted first to find some way of filling students' minds with a goodly store of general ideas, available on demand.
This temptation is not necessarily a bad one.
After all, if we think of the adult writers who interest us, most of them have such a store;
they have read and thought about man's major problems, and they have opinions and arguments ready to hand about how men ought to live, how society ought to be run, how literature ought to be written.
Edmund Wilson, for example, one of the most consistently interesting men alive, seems to have an inexhaustible flow of reasoned opinions on any subject that comes before him.
Obviously our students are not going to interest us until they too have some ideas.
</p>
<p>
But it is not easy to impart ideas.
It is not even easy to impart opinions, though a popular teacher can usually manage to get students to parrot his views.
But ideas&#151;that is, opinions backed with genuine reasoning&#151;are extremely difficult to develop.
If they were not, we wouldn't have a problem in the first place;
we could simply send our students off with an assignment to prove their conviction that God does or does not exist or that the American high school system is the best on God's earth, and the interesting arguments would flow.
</p>
<p>
There is, in fact, no short cut to the development of reasoned ideas.
Years and years of daily contact with the world of ideas are required before the child can be expected to begin formulating his own ideas and his own reasons.
And for the most part the capacity to handle abstract ideas comes fairly late.
I recently saw a paper of a bright high school sophomore, from a good private school, relating the economic growth of China and India to their political development and relative supply of natural resources.
It was a terrible paper;
the student's hatred of the subject, his sense of frustration in trying to invent generalizations about processes that were still too big for him, showed in every line.
The child's parent told me that when the paper was returned by the geography teacher, he had penciled on the top of one page, "Why do you mix so many bad ideas with your good ones?"
The son was almost in tears, his father told me, with anger and helplessness.
 "He talks as if I'd put bad ideas in on purpose./ don't know a bad idea from a good one on this subject."
</p>
<p>
Yet with all this said, I am still convinced that general ideas are not only a resource but also a duty that cannot be dodged just because it is a dangerous one.
There is nothing we touch, as English teachers, that is immune to being tainted by our touch;
all the difference lies in how we go about it.
</p>
<p>
Ideas are a resource because adolescents are surprisingly responsive to any real encouragement to think for themselves, if methods of forced feeding are avoided.
The seventeen-year-old who has been given nothing but commonplaces and clich&#233;s all his life and who finally discovers a teacher with ideas of his own may have his life changed, and, as I shall say in my final point, when his life is changed his writing is changed.
Perhaps some of you can remember, as I can, a first experience with a teacher who could think for himself.
I can remember going home from a conversation with my high school chemistry teacher and audibly vowing to myself:
 "Someday I'm going to be able to think for myself like that."
There was nothing especially unconventional about Luther Gidding's ideas&#151;at least I can remember few of them now.
But what I cannot forget is the way he had with an idea, the genuine curiosity with which he approached it, the pause while he gave his little thoughtful cough, and then the bulldog tenacity with which he would argue it through.
And I am convinced that though he never required me to write a line, he did more to improve my writing during the high school years than all of my English teachers put together.
The diary I kept to record my sessions with him, never read by anyone, was the best possible writing practice.
