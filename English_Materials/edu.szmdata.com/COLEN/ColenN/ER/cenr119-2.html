</p>
<p>
The day the lady took her clothes off on Michigan Avenue, people were leaving downtown as usual.
The workday had come to an end;
men and women were heading for bus and train stations, in a hurry to get home.
</p>
<p>
She walked south on Michigan;
she was wearing a white robe, as if she had been to the beach.
She was blond and in her thirties.
</p>
<p>
As she passed the Radisson Hotel, Roosevelt Williams, a doorman, was opening the door of a cab for one of the hotel's guests.
The woman did not really pause while she walked;
she merely shrugged the robe off, and it fell to the sidewalk.
</p>
<p>
She was wearing what appeared to be the bottom of a blue bikini bathing suit, although one woman who was directly next to her said it was just underwear.
She wore nothing else.
</p>
<p>
Williams at first did not believe what he was seeing.
If you hang around long enough, you will see everything:
robberies, muggings, street fights, murders.
But a naked woman on North Michigan Avenue?
Williams had not seen that before and neither, apparently, had the other people on the street.
</p>
<p>
It was strange;
her white robe lay on the sidewalk, and by all accounts she was smiling.
But no one spoke to her.
A report in the newspaper the next day quoted someone:
 "The cars were stopping, the people on the buses were staring, people were shouting, and people were taking pictures."
But that is not what other people who were there that afternoon said.
</p>
<p>
The atmosphere was not carnival-like, they said.
Rather, they said, it was as if something very sad was taking place.
It took only a moment for people to realize that this was not some stunt designed to promote a product or a movie.
Without anyone telling them, they understood that the woman was troubled, and that what she was doing had nothing to do with sexual titillation;
it was more of a cry for help.
</p>
<p>
The cry for help came in a way that such cries often come.
The woman was violating one of the basic premises of the social fabric.
She was doing something that is not done.
She was not shooting anyone, or breaking a window, or shouting in anger.
Rather, in a way that everyone understood, she was signaling that things were not right.
</p>
<p>
The line is so thin between matters being manageable and being out of hand.
One day a person may be barely all right;
the next the same person may have crossed over.
</p>
<p>
The woman continued to walk past Tribune Tower.
People who saw her said that the look on her face was almost peaceful.
She did not seem to think she was doing anything unusual;
she was described as appearing "blissful."
Whatever the reaction on the street was, she seemed calm, as if she believed herself to be in control.
</p>
<p>
She walked over the Michigan Avenue bridge.
Again, people who were there report that no one harassed her;
no one jeered at her or attempted to touch her.
At some point on the bridge, she removed her bikini bottom.
Now she was completely undressed, and still she walked.
</p>
<p>
 "It was as if people knew not to bother her," said one woman who was there.
 "To tell it, it sounds like something very lewd and sensational was going on.
But it wasn't like that at all.
It was as if people knew that something very&#160;... fragile&#160;... was taking place.
I was impressed with the maturity with which people were handling it.
No one spoke to her, but you could tell that they wished someone would help her."
</p>
<p>
Back in front of the Radisson, a police officer had picked up the woman's robe.
He was on his portable radio, advising his colleagues that the woman was walking over the bridge.
</p>
<p>
When the police caught up with the woman, she was just standing there, naked in downtown Chicago, still smiling.
The first thing the police did was hand her some covering and ask her to put it on;
the show was over.
</p>
<p>
People who were there said that there was no reaction from the people who were watching.
They said that the juvenile behavior you might expect in such a situation just didn't happen.
After all, when a man walks out on a ledge in a suicide attempt, there are always people down below who call for him to jump.
But this day, by all accounts, nothing like that took place.
No one called for her to stay undressed;
no one cursed the police officers for stopping her.
</p>
<p>
 "It was as if everyone was relieved," said a woman who saw it.
They were embarrassed by it;
it made them feel bad.
They were glad that someone had stopped her.
And she was still smiling.
She seemed to be off somewhere."
</p>
<p>
 "The police charged her with no crime;
they took her to Read Mental Health Center, where she was reported to have signed herself in voluntarily.
Within minutes things were back to as they always are on Michigan Avenue;
there was no reminder of the naked lady who had reminded people how fragile is the everyday world in which we live.
