<p class="storyTitle">Uncle Jim's Wink at Life</p>
<p class="storyAuthor">
John L. Phillips
</p>
<p>
I was ten years old, and I'd been caught in a lie.
I stubbornly denied breaking a window in Harold Colby's barn, but my parents knew perfectly well that I had done it.
</p>
<p>
In those days in the little town of Pultneyville, N.Y., a broken window was a big deal, and I was rather miserable.
</p>
<p>
I suspected, too, that my parents had told Uncle Jim, whom I worshiped.
But coming back from a trip to the store, riding beside him on the front seat of his dark-green DeSoto Firedome, I glanced over a time or two, fast.
I could see a smile at the corner of his mouth.
</p>
<p>
 "Telling the truth is always easier," he said, straight out of the blue.
He took his eyes off the road for a second and grinned at me.
 "So it's perfect for a lazybones like you and me."
</p>
<p>
I swallowed, watching the mailboxes go by, waiting.
But that was it&#151;no scolding, no moralizing.
My uncle began to hum, and I was in relief.
Like you and me.
My pal was still my pal.
</p>
<p>
It wasn't long before I got the chance to test Uncle Jim's thesis.
One day I spotted a pair of brown leather gloves on the windowsill in the post office.
Old Mrs. Jameson had come in wearing them and had left barehanded, struggling with a bulky package.
I tried the gloves on.
They were perfect.
</p>
<p>
That night I had a losing bout with my conscience.
The truth is easier for a lazybones like you and me.
The following day, I returned the gloves and told Mrs. Jameson the truth.
</p>
<p>
A month later, a small package arrived for me.
Inside were the gloves and a note:
 "I needed another pair, and thought you might like these.
Mrs. J."
</p>
<p>
When my uncle asked where I got the gloves, I told him the story.
 "See?" he said, delighted.
Yes, I did see.
I still do.
</p>
<p>
James Bellows Little would have winced at the idea that he ever taught anybody anything.
He had a lifetime dislike to cookie-cutter wisdom.
But he always applied a light touch to common sense as it angled through his prism.
</p>
<p>
He did it almost every time I saw him.
His eyebrows would arch invitingly as he waited for me to get it, whatever it was&#151;how to use a thesaurus or operate a Coleman stove, how to measure an opponent across a tennis net or a shift of wind across a mainsail.
I listened and watched, and once in a while, I even learned.
</p>
<p>
Uncle Jim even taught me to see through tears.
My father died when I was 12, and as my mother's brother, Uncle Jim must have felt an urge to step in, but he didn't.
He stayed in, providing a steady hand and a calm presence.
</p>
<p>
Only late in the game did I realize how quickly he'd tailored what he did and said to the needs of a kid who hadn't really known he had any.
My uncle seemed to think, for instance, that I could stand a little help on gullibility, so he literally used his head.
</p>
<p>
One day when I was seven, I asked him why his head was bald but his chest was hairy.
 "Oh," he said breezily, "during World War II I had the hair on my head transplanted.
The Army Air Corps did it for free, and that way I'd never have to bother with barbershops.
Not a bad deal, huh?" he asked with a wink.
</p>
<p>
It was a good three years before I began to have serious doubts.
</p>
<p>
Uncle Jim ran an industrial-rubber-goods company in downtown Rochester, and in those days before major highways, the rush-hour commute to his house on Lake Ontario could be brutal.
I was with him one afternoon when, never exceeding the speed limits, he made it without catching a single red light.
</p>
<p>
 "How'd you do that?"
I wanted to know.
</p>
<p>
 "Rhythm drive," he said cheerfully.
 "I don't know why I have it, but I do.
So does your mother.
Your Uncle Bill doesn't."
</p>
<p>
He glanced at me with an almost straight face.
 "Maybe you've got it, but we won't know for a few years."
</p>
<p>
Rhythm drive!
I bought it on the spot, and clung to it until I was old enough to get my driver's license.
Eventually I'd see for myself that daily commuters need a notion like rhythm drive.
</p>
<p>
Rush-hour traffic?
Baldness?
If you can't beat 'em, celebrate 'em!
That was Uncle Jim's way.
</p>
<p>
Over and over he reminded me that friendship is a currency that never devalues.
And he had his own way of showing it.
Just back from a trip, for example, he'd stop the first friend he saw and insist on buying him lunch.
If the guy didn't have time, he'd offer to buy him a hat.
This was how he told his pals he missed them and how good it was to see them again.
</p>
<p>
To strengthen my self-assurance, every now and then Uncle Jim would offer to bet all the change in his pocket against all the change in mine.
No fair checking to see how much I had in my pocket, either.
It was a dare, and it made a kid feel like a gun-slinger.
He always decided what the bet was about, but I didn't find out until I'd said yes.
</p>
<p>
 "Want to bet?" he'd say, all of a sudden.
 "Okay."
And the game was on.
</p>
<p>
 "What's the capital of&#160;...&#160;
Ohio?"
 "Ummmmmmm.
Columbus!"
</p>
<p>
 "Hmm," he'd say, pretending surprise, then reach into his pocket.
 "Hey, what do you know&#151;27 cents!"
</p>
<p>
It wasn't the money;
it was the reminder that sometimes you just have to jump in&#151;even when you don't know how cold the water is.
I can't remember ever losing one of those bets.
Somehow Uncle Jim made it work out that way.
It was a confidence game in the best sense.
Most kids need things like that somewhere along the line.
I sure did.
</p>
<p>
In time my uncle would teach me many manly things&#151;how to knot a bow tie, how to handle a tractor, how to fold a gabardine suit so it doesn't wrinkle, how to look life in the eye&#151;and tell if it's winking back.
</p>
<p>
He loved beauty, too, and wasn't afraid to show it.
Thrusting a pair of gardening gloves and my aunt's rubber boots at me, he'd lead me on a search for wildflowers.
Back at the house, he'd put a huge jar on the table, then seek my counsel on how best to arrange our flowers.
Be honest, be brave, be kind, look around&#151;the words were never uttered, but the message always got through.
</p>
<p>
By example, too, Uncle Jim reminded me that men read books and value them for their beauty and inspiration.
I was proud to be among those who knew behind which living-room volumes&#151;some well-thumbed works of Dickens&#151;he kept his macadamia nuts.
</p>
<p>
His encouragement reminded me that my father had been a voracious reader and a good gardener.
Would I otherwise have scorned such "sissy" pursuits?
Possibly.
Uncle Jim wasn't taking chances.
He helped me arrive at my dad's conclusion:
these were things worth making time for.
</p>
<p>
Uncle Jim and I hadn't talked much about my father in the years since his death.
But that changed one afternoon when we were cutting brush at his place at the lake.
</p>
<p>
 "When Monty died, you lost a father, and your mom lost a husband," he said.
 "I lost a friend.
But your dad lost the chance to see how his hopes would turn out.
All of a sudden, it was the end of a life, and it was too soon&#151;he never got to know.
That's the tough part."
</p>
<p>
He looked at me.
There was a touch of anger in his face.
He, too, resented my father's having drawn so short a straw.
I was startled to realize that, independently, I had the same feelings.
Maybe I was growing up.
</p>
<p>
On one August day, on a fishing trip near Henderson Harbor not far from the St. Lawrence River, the two of us were in a battered 12-footer powered by a small outboard.
I was a bit hangdog at our slow putt-putting along.
Uncle Jim said speed was fine if you wanted to go fast, but slowing down made any journey less of a blur.
 "It helps you focus," he said.
</p>
<p>
I thought of that decades later when he was dying, becalmed by a failing heart in his 82nd year.
Was he seeing more, even as he slowed?
</p>
<p>
Jim Little was an observer who touched those he loved by sharing what he saw.
I understood some of what he showed me pretty fast, but other things took decades to become clear.
</p>
<p>
From time to time in his later years, he would send me something I'd sent him 30 or 35 years earlier.
A drawing of his house on the bluff.
A crayon rendering of a sailboat.
</p>
<p>
At first, these mementos triggered feelings of affectionate amusement.
But as they accumulated, I came to recognize them as the clearest signposts Uncle Jim had set out for me.
Time has passed, they gently reminded.
You're not a short-pants nephew anymore.
Matter of fact, you've got nephews of your own, so hop to it.
</p>
<p>
Those aging scraps lie flat in a wooden box near my desk.
But my mind's eye sees them as my heart knows them to be&#151;tightly rolled into a baton that has finally passed to my hand.
