<p class="storyTitle">How It Feels to Be Out of Work</p>
<p class="storyAuthor">
Jan Halvorsen
</p>
<p>
Layoffs, unemployment and recession have always affected Walter Cronkite's tone of voice and the editorial page.
And maybe they affected a neighborhood business or a friend's uncle.
But these terms have always been just words, affecting someone else's world, like a passing ambulance.
At least they were until a few weeks ago, when the ambulance came for me.
</p>
<p>
Even as I sat staring blankly at my supervisor, hearing, "I've got bad news:
we're going to have to let you go," it all still seemed no more applicable to my daily life than a "60 Minutes" expose.
I kept waiting for the alternative&#151;"but you can come back after a couple of months," or "you could take a salary cut, a different position," or even, "April fool."
But none of these came.
This was final.
There was no mistake and no alternative.
</p>
<p>
You find yourself going back over it in your idle moments.
There wasn't so much as a "Thank you" for the long nights working alone, the "Sure, no problem, I'll have it tomorrow," the "Let me know if I can help," the "I just went ahead and did it this weekend" and, especially, for the "You forgot to tell me it changed!
Oh, that's all right, I'll just do it over.
No big deal."
</p>
<p>
No big deal.
How it all echoes through your evenings and awakens you in the morning.
The mornings are probably the worst&#151;waking up with a habitual jar, for the first two weeks, thinking, "I'm late!"
Late for what?
The dull ache in your lower stomach reminds you:
late for nothing.
</p>
<p>
Again, you face the terms.
 "Loss of self-esteem and security, fear of the future, stress, depression."
You wonder dully if eating a dozen chocolate-chip cookies, wearing a bathrobe until 4, combing your hair at 5, cleaning behind the stove (twice) and crying in an employment-agency parking lot qualify as symptoms of stress or maybe loss of self-esteem.
Fighting with you spouse/ boyfriend?
Aha&#151;tension in personal relationships.
</p>
<p>
The loss of a job is rejection, resulting in the same hurt feelings as if a friend had told you to "bug off."
Only this "friend" filled up 40 to 60 (or more) hours of your week.
Constant references to the staff as "family" only accentuate the feeling of desertion and deception.
You picture yourself going home to your parents or spouse and being informed, "Your services as our daughter/ my wife are no longer required.
Pick up your baby pictures as you leave."
</p>
<p>
Each new affirmation of unemployment renews the pain:
the first trip to the employment agency, the first friend you tell, the first interview and, most dreaded of all, the first trip to the unemployment office.
</p>
<p>
Standing in line at the unemployment office makes you feel very much the same as you did the first time you ever flunked a class or a test&#151;as if you had a big red "F' for "Failure" printed across your forehead.
I fantasize myself standing at the end of the line in a crisp and efficient blue suit, chin up, neat and straight as a corporate executive.
As I move down the line I start to come unglued and a half hour later, when I finally reach the desk clerk, I am slouching and sallow in torn jeans, tennis shoes and a jacket from the Salvation Army, carrying my worldly belongings in a shopping bag and unable to speak.
</p>
<p>
You do eventually become accustomed to being unemployed, in the way you might accept a bad limp.
And you gradually quit beating yourself for not having been somehow indispensable&#151;or for not having become an accountant.
You tire of straining your memory for possible infractions.
You recover some of the confidence that always told you how good you were at your job and accept what the supervisor said:
 "This doesn't reflect on your job performance;
sales are down 30 per cent this month."
</p>
<p>
But each time you recover that hallowed self-esteem, you renew a fight to maintain it.
Each time you go to a job interview and give them your best and they hire someone else, you go another round with yourself and your self-esteem.
Your unemployment seems to drag on beyond all justification.
You start to glimpse a stranger in your rearview mirror.
The stranger suddenly looks like a bum.
You look at her with clinical curiosity.
Hmmm. Obviously into the chronic stages.
Definitely not employable.
</p>
<p>
We unemployed share a social stigma similar to that of the rape victim.
Whether consciously or subconsciously, much of the work-ethic-driven public feels that you've somehow "asked for it," secretly wanted to lose your job and "flirted" with unemployment through your attitude&#151;probably dressed in a way to invite it (left the vest unbuttoned on your three-piece suit).
</p>
<p>
Satisfaction
</p>
<p>
But the worst of it isn't society's work-ethic morality;
it's your own, which you never knew you had.
You find out how much self-satisfaction was gained from even the most simple work-related task:
a well-worded letter, a well-handled phone call&#151;even a clean file.
Being useful to yourself isn't enough.
</p>
<p>
But then almost everyone has heard about the need to be a useful member of society.
What you didn't know about was the loneliness.
You've spent your life almost constantly surrounded by people, in classes, in dorms and at work.
To suddenly find yourself with only your cat to talk to all day distorts your sense of reality.
You begin to worry that flights of fancy might become one way.
</p>
<p>
But you always were, and still are, stronger than that.
You maintain balance and perspective, mainly through resorting frequently to sarcasm and irreverence.
Although something going wrong in any aspect of your life now seems to push you into temporary despair much more easily than before, you have some very important things to hang on to&#151;people who care, your sense of humor, your talents, your cat and your hopes.
</p>
<p>
And beyond that, you've gained something&#151;a little more knowledge and a lot more compassion.
You've learned the value of the routine you scorned and the importance of the job you took for granted.
But most of all, you've learned what a "7.6 per cent unemployment rate" really means.
