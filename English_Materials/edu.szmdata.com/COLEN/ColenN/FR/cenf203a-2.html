<p class="storyTitle">A Long Walk Home</p><p>
I grew up in the south of Spain in a little community called Estepona.
I was 16 when one morning, my father told me I could drive him into a remote village called Mijas, about 18 miles away, on the condition that I take the car in to be serviced at a nearby garage.
Having just learned to drive and hardly ever having the opportunity to use the car, I readily accepted.
I drove Dad into Mijas and promised to pick him up at 4 p.m., then drove to a nearby garage and dropped off the car.
Because I had a few hours to spare, I decided to catch a couple of movies at a theater near the garage.
However, I became so interested in the films that I didn't pay any attention to the time.
When the last movie had finished, I looked down at my watch.
It was six o'clock.
I was two hours late!
</p>
<p>
I knew Dad would be angry if he found out I'd been watching movies.
He'd never let me drive again.
I decided to tell him that the car needed some repairs and that they had taken longer than had been expected.
I drove up to the place where we had planned to meet and saw Dad waiting patiently on the corner.
I apologized for being late and told him that I'd come as quickly as I could, but the car had needed some major repairs.
I'll never forget the look he gave me.
</p>
<p>
 "I'm disappointed that you feel you have to lie to me, Jason."
</p>
<p>
 "What do you mean?
I'm telling the truth."
</p>
<p>
Dad looked at me again.
 "When you did not show up, I called the garage to ask if there were any problems, and they told me that you had not yet picked up the car.
So you see, I know there were no problems with the car."
A feeling of guilt ran through me as I weakly confessed to my trip to the movie theater and the real reason for my being late.
Dad listened intently as a sadness passed through him.
</p>
<p>
 "I'm angry, not with you but with myself.
You see, I realize that I have failed as a father if after all these years you feel that you have to lie to me.
I have failed because I have brought up a son who cannot even tell the truth to his own father.
I'm going to walk home now and think seriously about where I have gone wrong all these years."
</p>
<p>
 "But Dad, it's 18 miles to home.
It's dark.
You can't walk home."
</p>
<p>
My protests and my apologies were useless.
I had let my father down and I was about to learn one of the most painful lessons of my life.
Dad began walking along the dusty road.
I quickly jumped in the car and followed behind, hoping he would weaken.
I begged all the way, telling him how sorry I was, but he simply ignored me, continuing on silently, thoughtfully and painfully.
For 18 miles I drove behind him, at a speed of about five miles per hour.
</p>
<p>
Seeing my father in so much physical and emotional pain was the most distressing and painful experience that I have ever faced.
However, it was also the most successful lesson.
I have never lied to him since.
</p>
