<p class="storyTitle">15. "Journalist&#160;... Rewarding, But Very Political"</p>
<p>The journalism bug bit me at a young age and I chased my dream in high school and college. Guess it was the Mary Tyler Moore and Lou Grant shows that inspired me.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, that was TV; this was reality. I worked in TV and at newspapers. Movies and television often make these out to be glamorous jobs, but let me assure you nothing could be further from the truth. For the rookie, it's often very long hours (50-70 per week not uncommon) and the pay is just a crime. Many in management don't believe in paying overtime, even when it's due. I had to file complaints against one employer (the owner of a small newspaper chain) and my last employer at the Labor Department. They were burning people out like there was no tomorrow. We should've installed revolving doors.</p>
<p>Working in the press (TV or newsprint) can often be VERY stressful. There is ALWAYS a push on to get the information out (in its complete form) first and to get it out completely accurately. TV stations succeed greatly at the former, but quite often blow it on the latter. And you rarely hear a TV reporter or anchor apologize or admit a mistake. Newspapers do it every day, and some feel that blows their credibility, but it should do the opposite.</p>
<p>With about 20 years in the field and four years at my last job as editor in chief, I was released for political reasons. My publishers were high-ranking members of a political party. They were drinking buddies with the governor and many US senators. Despite their efforts to "draft" me, I refused to sign the dotted line on application forms (for the party) and was fired. The day after election day I was told I was being released because I did not live in the community. Only two people of the 25-30 working there lived in the community.</p>
<p>My greatest sense of accomplishment in this business has come from enlightening the public, making them aware of politicians and government officials breaking laws or just outright lying. You would not believe all the mess I have seen. Some of my stories and editorials have earned me awards and a number of them have sparked investigations by the state police and FBI. All in a day's work.</p>
<p>Yes, it's an ego thing at first, but that quickly wears off. It's a VERY cut-throat business. I began to see that in college and grad school. Working in a news room you have to get over the personalities, the egos and try to work around management's pet peeves. We've had to spike (kill, censor) stories in TV and at papers because some stupid advertiser would be upset. Usually a friend of a friend, or a friend of an advertiser. It's SUCH a joke.</p>
<p>I now wish I had not changed my major from computer science to journalism. Ouch! I would be making more money and living an easier life.</p>
<p>My dream is to own a newspaper&#151;probably a niche publication or a trade journal, somewhere in North Carolina or Colorado. Wish me luck.</p>
