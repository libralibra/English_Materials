<p class="storyTitle">Women in the Workforce</p><p>
Throughout the world, in nations rich and poor, more and more women are taking up work outside the home.
In the developed nations of Europe and North America, the percentage of women that make up the total workforce has more than doubled over the past four decades.
This trend towards more and more women joining the workforce is seen clearly in the recent experience of Britain, where women now make up almost half the country's workforce.
According to a recent report from the British research service, Jobs Research UK, there are two reasons for the great rise among women entering the workforce in Britain over the past decade:
The first, and major, reason for this is that unemployment rose more quickly among men during the last time the economy was at a low;
the second reason is that the number of women working in service jobs has increased greatly.
</p>
<p>
According to Incomes Data Services (IDS), Britain appears to be fast approaching a point when there will be as many women employees as men, although half the women are in part-time employment.
The IDS predicted that in the coming months job losses were more likely to continue to affect more full-time male workers than the mostly female part-time workers.
</p>
<p>
 "If these trends continue, then economic recovery is likely to quicken the move toward a much larger part-time female workforce, employed chiefly in the service sector," the report said.
</p>
<p>
These trends are not limited to the UK alone.
Throughout Europe and North America, and increasingly even in Japan, the percentage of female workers in the workforce is steadily increasing, while the percentage of male workers continues to fall.
Because the jobs taken up by women are chiefly service sector jobs and because many are part-time positions, the results of this trend are clear.
Family incomes will stay frozen and even fall throughout most of the developed world.
As high-paying manufacturing jobs become more difficult to find and with companies moving production to cheaper markets in developing nations in Asia, Latin America and Africa, unemployment among men in developed nations will rise further, in many countries to ten per cent or more.
How these changes in the workforce of Britain and other developed nations affect national policies, social development and family relations are important questions that researchers will be seeking to answer over the coming decade.
