<p class="storyTitle">The Automobile in American Life</p><p>
The private automobile has long played an important role in the United States.
In fact, it has become a necessary and important part of the American way of life.
In 1986, sixty-nine percent of American families owned at least one car, and thirty-eight percent had more than one.
By giving workers rapid, convenient transportation, the automobile has freed them from having to live near their place of work.
This has encouraged the growth of the suburbs, but it has also led to traffic problems in the city.
In addition, the automobile has contributed to the weakening of neighborhood ties by making it easy to keep up friendships at a distance and to enjoy leisure activities far from home.
</p>
<p>
For farm families the automobile is very helpful.
It has made it possible for them to travel to town frequently for business and for pleasure, and also to transport their children to distant schools.
</p>
<p>
Family life has been affected in various ways.
The car helps to keep families together when it is used for picnics, outings, camping trips, and other shared experiences.
However, when teenage children have the use of the car (or own one), their parents can't keep an eye on them.
If they are immature, they sometimes become involved in situations that lead to serious trouble.
There is even greater danger if the driver (young or old) has been drinking alcohol or taking drugs&#151;or is "showing off" by speeding or breaking other traffic laws.
Mothers of victims of such accidents have formed an organization called MADD (Mothers Against Drunk Driving).
These women want to prevent further tragedies.
They have worked to encourage the government to establish and enforce a national minimum drinking age.
They send speakers to schools and to meetings of citizens to impress people with the importance of careful, responsible driving.
Students have formed a similar organization, SADD (Students Against Drunk Driving) and are spreading the same message among their friends.
</p>
<p>
For many Americans the automobile is a necessity as well as a convenience.
But for some, it is also a mark of social status, an important middle-class symbol;
and for young people, a sign of becoming an adult.
Altogether, cars mean very much to Americans.
