<p class="storyTitle">Americans and Food</p><p>
An unusual but timely cartoon recently appeared in the local newspaper.
The single panel showed a gravel-pit operation with piles of raw earth and large cranes.
Next to one of the cranes stood the owner of the gravel pit&#151;a grizzled, tough-looking character, hammer in hand, pointing proudly to the new sign he had just tacked up.
The sign read, "Fred's Fill Dirt and Croissants."
The cartoon illustrates an interesting phenomenon:
the changing food habits of Americans.
Our meals used to consist of something like home-cooked pot roast, mashed potatoes laced with butter and salt, a thick slice of apple pie topped with a healthy scoop of vanilla ice cream&#151;plain, heavy meals, cooked from scratch, and eaten leisurely at home.
But America has changed, and as it has, so have what we Americans eat and how we eat it.
</p>
<p>
We used to have simple, unsophisticated tastes and looked with suspicion at anything more exotic than a hamburger.
Admittedly, we did adopt some foods from the various immigrant groups who flocked to our shores.
We learned to eat croissants, those small, sweet French bread rolls, and also Chinese food and pizza, but in the last few years, the international character of our diet has grown tremendously.
We can walk into any mall in Middle America and buy Mexican food like pita bread and tacos.
Such foods are often changed on their journey from exotic imports to ordinary "American" meals, but the imports are still a long way from hamburger on a bun.
</p>
<p>
Why have we become more worldly in our tastes?
For one thing, television blankets the country with information about new food products and trends.
Viewers in rural Montana know that the latest craving in Washington, D.C. is Cajun cooking and that something called tofu is now available in the local supermarket.
Another reason for the growing international flavor of our food is that many young Americans have traveled abroad and gotten hooked on new tastes and flavors.
Backpacking students and young professionals vacationing in Europe come home with a taste for authentic French bread or German beer.
Finally, continuing waves of immigrants settle in the cities where many of us live, causing significant changes in what we eat.
Vietnamese, Haitians, and Thais, for instance, bringing their native foods and cooking styles with them and eventually open small markets or restaurants.
In time, the new food will become Americanized enough to take its place in our national diet.
</p>
<p>
Our growing concern with health has also affected the way we eat.
For the last few years, the media have warned us about the dangers of our traditional diet, high in salt and fat, low in fiber.
The media also began to educate us about the dangers of processed foods pumped full of chemical additives.
As a result, consumers began to demand healthier foods, and manufacturers started to change some of their products.
Many foods, such as lunch meat, canned vegetables, and soups, were made available in low-fat, low-sodium versions.
Whole-grain cereals and high-fiber breads also began to appear on the grocery shelves.
Moreover, the food industry started to produce all-natural products&#151;everything from potato chips to ice cream&#151;without additives and preservatives.
Not surprisingly, the restaurant industry responded to this switch to healthier foods, luring customers with salad bars, broiled fish, and steamed vegetables.
</p>
<p>
Our food habits are being affected, too, by the rapid increase in the number of women working outside the home.
Sociologists and other experts believe that two important factors triggered this phenomenon:
the women's movement and a changing economic climate.
Women were assured that it was acceptable, even rewarding, to work outside the home;
many women also discovered that they had to work just to keep up with the cost of living.
As the traditional role of homemaker changed, so did the way families ate.
With Mom working, there wasn't time for her to prepare the traditional three square meals a day.
Instead, families began looking for alternatives to provide quick meals.
What was the result?
For one thing, there was a boom in fast-food restaurants.
The suburban or downtown strip that once contained a lone McDonald's now features Wendy 's, KFCs, Burger King, and Pizza Hut.
Families also began to depend on frozen foods as another time-saving alternative.
Once again, though, demand changed the kind of frozen food available.
Frozen food no longer consist of foil trays divided into greasy fried chicken, watery corn niblets, and lumpy mashed potatoes.
Supermarkets now stock a range of supposedly tasty frozen dinners.
</p>
<p>
It may not be possible to pick up a ton of fill dirt and a half-dozen croissants at the same place, but America's food habits are definitely changing.
If it is true that "you are what you eat," then America's identity is evolving along with its diet.
