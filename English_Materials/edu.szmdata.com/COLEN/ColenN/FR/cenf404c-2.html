<p class="storyTitle">The Jeaning of America and the World</p><p>
This is the story of a sturdy American symbol which has now spread throughout most of the world.
The symbol is not the dollar.
It is not even Coca-Cola.
It is a simple pair of pants called blue jeans, and what the pants symbolize is what Alexis de Tocqueville called "a manly and legitimate passion for equality&#160;...&#160;"
Blue jeans are favored equally by bureaucrats and cowboys;
bankers and deadbeats;
fashion designers and beer drinkers.
They draw no distinctions and recognize no classes;
they are merely American.
Yet they are sought after almost everywhere in the world.
They have been around for a long time, and it seems likely that they will outlive even the necktie.
</p>
<p>
This ubiquitous American symbol was the invention of a Bavarian-born Jew.
His name was Levi Strauss.
</p>
<p>
He was born in Bad Ocheim, Germany, in 1829, and during the European political disorder of 1848 decided to take his chances in New York, to which his two brothers already had emigrated.
For two years he was a lowly peddler, hauling sundries door-to-door to eke out a hand-to-mouth living.
When a married sister in San Francisco offered to pay his way West in 1850, he jumped at the opportunity, taking with him bolts of canvas he hoped to sell for making tents.
</p>
<p>
It was the wrong kind of canvas for that purpose, but while talking with a miner, he learned that pants&#151;sturdy pants that would stand up to the rigors of the diggings&#151;were almost impossible to find.
Opportunity beckoned.
On the spot, Strauss measured the man's waist and inseam with a piece of string and, for six dollars in gold dust, had the canvas tailored into a pair of stiff but rugged pants.
The miner was delighted with the result, word got around about "those pants of Levi 's," and Strauss was in business.
The company has been in business ever since.
</p>
<p>
When Strauss ran out of canvas, he wrote his two brothers to send more.
He received instead a rough, brown cotton cloth made in Nimes, France&#151;called serge de Nimes and swiftly shortened to "denim" (the word "jeans" derives from <span class="NP">G &#234; nes</span>, the French word for Genoa, where a similar cloth was produced).
Almost from the first, Strauss had his cloth dyed the distinctive indigo that gave blue jeans their name, but it was not until the 1870s that he added the copper rivets which have long since become a company trademark.
</p>
<p>
Over the following years the company prospered locally and by the time of his death in 1902, Strauss had become a man of prominence in California.
For three decades thereafter the business remained profitable though small.
From a company with fifteen salespeople, two plants, and almost no business east of the Mississippi in 1946, the organization grew in thirty years to include a sales force of more than twenty-two thousand, with fifty plants and offices in thirty-five countries.
Each year, more than 250,000,000 items of Levi's clothing are sold&#151;including more than 83,000,000 pairs of riveted blue jeans.
They have become, through marketing, word of mouth, and demonstrable reliability, the common pants of America.
They can be purchased pre-washed, pre-faded, and pre-shrunk for the suitably proletarian look.
</p>
<p>
The pants have become a tradition, and along the way have acquired a history of their own.
There was, for example, the Wyoming man who used his jeans as a tow-rope to haul his car out of a ditch.
And then there is the particularly terrifying story of the careless construction worker who dangled fifty-two stories above the street until rescued, his sole support the Levi's belt loop through which his rope was hooked.
