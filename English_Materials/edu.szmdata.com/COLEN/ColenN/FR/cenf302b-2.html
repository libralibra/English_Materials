<p class="storyTitle">Best of Friends, Worlds Apart</p><p>
Havana, sometime before 1994:
As dusk descends on the quaint seaside village of Guanabo, two young men kick a soccer ball back and forth and back and forth across the sand.
The tall one, Joel Ruiz, is black.
The short, muscular one, Achmed Valdes, is white.
</p>
<p>
They are the best of friends.
</p>
<p>
Miami, January 2000:
Mr. Valdes is playing soccer, as he does every Saturday, with a group of light-skinned Latinos in a park near his apartment.
Mr. Ruiz surprises him with a visit, and Mr. Valdes, flushed and sweating, runs to greet him.
They shake hands warmly.
</p>
<p>
But when Mr. Valdes darts back to the game, Mr. Ruiz stands off to the side, arms crossed, looking on as his childhood friend plays the game that was once their shared joy.
Mr. Ruiz no longer plays soccer.
He prefers basketball with black Latinos and African-Americans from his neighborhood.
</p>
<p>
The two men live only four miles apart, not even 15 minutes by car.
Yet they are separated by a far greater distance, one they say they never imagined back in Cuba.
</p>
<p>
In ways that are obvious to the black man but far less so to the white one, they have grown apart in the United States because of race.
For the first time, they inhabit a place where the color of their skin defines the outlines of their lives&#151;where they live, the friends they make, how they speak, what they wear, even what they eat.
</p>
<p>
 "It's like I am here and he is over there," Mr. Ruiz said, "And we can't cross over to the other's world."
</p>
<p>
It is not that, growing up in Cuba's mix of black and white, they were unaware of their difference in color.
Fidel Castro may have officially put an end to racism in Cuba, but that does not mean racism has simply gone away.
Still, color was not what defined them.
Nationality, they had been taught, meant far more than race.
They felt, above all, Cuban.
</p>
<p>
Here in America, Mr. Ruiz still feels Cuban.
But above all he feels black.
His world is a black world, and to live there is to be constantly conscious of race.
He works in a black-owned bar, dates black women, goes to an African-American barber.
White barbers, he says, "don't understand black hair."
He generally avoids white neighborhoods, and when his world and the white world meet, he feels always watched, and he is always watchful.
</p>
<p>
For Joel Ruiz, there is little time for relaxation.
On this night, he works as a cashier at his uncle's bar in a black Miami neighborhood.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Valdes, who is 29, a year younger than his childhood friend, is simply, comfortably Cuban, an upwardly mobile citizen of the Miami mainstream.
He lives in an all-white neighborhood, hangs out with white Cuban friends and goes to black neighborhoods only when his job, as a deliveryman for Restonic mattresses, forces him to.
When he thinks about race, which is not very often, it is in terms learned from other white Cubans:
American blacks, he now believes, are to be avoided because they are dangerous and resentful of whites.
The only blacks he trusts, he says, are those he knows from Cuba.
</p>
<p>
Since leaving Havana in separate boats in 1994, the two friends have seen each other just a handful of times in Miami&#151;at a funeral, a baby shower, a birthday party and that soccer game, a meeting arranged for a newspaper photographer.
They have visited each other's homes only once.
</p>
<p>
They say they remain as good friends as ever, yet they both know there is little that binds them anymore but their memories.
Had they not become best friends in another country, in another time, they would not be friends at all today.
</p>
