<p class="storyTitle">03. A World Without Books or Music</p>
<p>If books had never been discovered, man would have found some other way of recording his communication. But then, for our consideration, we should include as books everything that is a written record. This would include tablets, papyrus and anything else&#151;including computer diskettes. In the case of music, it would be impossible to think that man can live without it. Looking at primitive cultures, it appears that music is actually a part of the human psyche. When two things are knocked together, music is produced. So for the sake of our discussion, it is intended to restrict the meaning of music to the popularly accepted concept. Music is the pleasing combination of sounds that we like to listen to.</p>
<p>Though it is difficult to, we can pretend that these things never existed. In this case we would not miss them today. To compare with recent inventions, let us look at radio and television. Though we cannot think of life without them today, this is so only from comparatively recent times. There are many of us living today who had seen a time when there was no television. They will tell us that life was not that much different. The same is probably true of radio. But books are a different thing because they, or something akin to them, began thousands of years ago. In the case of music, it goes back even further&#151;perhaps to millions of years. We may be able to imagine a world which never saw books, because books are a human invention. However, in the case of music this does not seem possible. Pleasing sounds are all around us; like the singing of the birds and the whistling of the wind. Music just seems to be inborn in us and in the world around us.</p>
<p>If books did not exist, the world will be a poorer place indeed. Great philosophies like Plato's would become unknown and all the pleasures and lessons we could get from them will be lost forever. Then there is literature like the works of the great masters like Shakespeare, Dickens and Jane Austen. What a sombre, miserable world it will be without the pleasures of reading. Since there are so many other things which depend on reading&#151;like plays, songs and movies&#151;we can expect them to disappear also. It would be a dark and unsatisfying world where knowledge is not propagated; where there are no books to derive pleasure from.</p>
<p>In the case of music: Without it the world will be bleak and cold indeed. It would be a terrible world with no cheery tunes, no songs to sing and no great music to lose ourselves in. A world which does not listen to the music of the great masters like Chopin and Beethoven would be a very sorry world. There will not be so many smiles on faces anymore. When we lose music, an expression of a deep part of ourselves&#151;from the soul&#151;is lost. With music, connected activities like dancing will be lost too. A world without music and dancing will bring us back to the Stone Age.</p>
<p>Unlike radio, television, telephones and computers, reading and music are not mere conveniences that we can live without. Reading is crucial for self-expression and for passing on records and knowledge to future generations. Music is part of our very soul. A world without these will not be the world as we know it. In fact, many of us would not want to live in such a world.</p>
