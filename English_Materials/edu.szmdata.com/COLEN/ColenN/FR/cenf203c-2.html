<p class="storyTitle">Rites of Passage</p><p>
Suddenly there come times when everything is different&#151;you're somehow another person
</p>
<p>
Several years ago my parents, my wife, my son,, and I ate at one of those restaurants where the menu is written on a blackboard.
After a wonderful dinner, the waiter set the bill in the middle of the table.
That's when it happened:
my father did not reach for the bill.
</p>
<p>
Conversation continued.
Finally it dawned on me.
I was supposed to pick up the bill!
After hundreds of restaurant meals with my parents, after a lifetime of thinking of my father as the one who had the money, it had all changed.
I reached for the check, and my view of myself was suddenly altered.
I was an adult.
</p>
<p>
Some people mark off their lives in years?
I measure mine in small events&#151;in rites of passage.
I did not become a young man at a particular age, like 13, but rather when a kid walked into the store where I worked and called me "mister".
He repeated it several times, looking straight at me.
The realization hit like a punch:
Me!
I was suddenly a mister.
</p>
<p>
There have been other milestones.
The cops of my youth always seemed big, even huge, and of course they were older than I was.
Then one day they were suddenly neither.
In fact, some were kids&#151;short kids at that.
The day came when I suddenly realized that all the football players in the game I was watching were younger than I was.
They were just big kids.
With that milestone went the dream that someday, maybe, I too could be a football player.
Without ever having reached the hill, I was over it.
</p>
<p>
I never thought that I would fall asleep in front of the television set as my father did.
Now it's what I do best.
I never thought that I would go to the beach and not swim.
Yet I spent all of August at the seaside and never once went into the ocean, I never thought that I would like opera, but now the sadness and combination of voice and orchestra appeal to me.
I never thought that I would prefer to stay home evenings, but now I find myself passing up parties.
I used to think that people who watched birds were strange, but this summer I found myself watching them, and maybe I'll get a book on the subject.
I long for a religious conviction that I never thought I'd want, and in arguments with my son, I repeat what my father used to say to me.
I still lose.
</p>
<p>
One day I bought a house.
One day&#151;what a day!&#151;
I became a father, and not too long after that I picked up the bill for my own father.
I thought then it was a rite of passage for me.
But one day, when I was a little older, I realized it was one for him too.
Another milestone.
</p>
