<p class="storyTitle">Conversational Ball Games</p><p>
After I was married and had lived in Japan for a while, my Japanese gradually improved and I could take part in simple conversations with my husband and his friends and family.
I began to notice that often, when I joined in, the others would look surprised, and the conversational topic would come to a halt.
After this happened several times, it became clear to me that I was doing something wrong.
But for a long time, I didn't know what it was.
</p>
<p>
Finally, after listening carefully to many Japanese conversations, I discovered what my problem was.
Even though I was speaking Japanese, I was handling the conversation in a Western way.
</p>
<p>
Japanese-style conversations develop quite differently from Western-style conversations.
And the difference isn't only in the languages.
I realized that just as I kept trying to hold Western-style conversations even when I was speaking Japanese, so my English students kept trying to hold Japanese-style conversations even when they were speaking English.
We were unconsciously playing entirely different conversational ball games.
</p>
<p>
A Western-style conversation between two people is like a game of tennis.
If I introduce a topic, a conversational ball, I expect you to hit it back.
If you agree with me, I don't expect you simply to agree and do nothing more.
I expect you to add something&#151;a reason for agreeing, another example, or an elaboration to carry the idea further.
But I don't expect you always to agree.
I am just as happy if you question me, or challenge me, or completely disagree with me.
Whether you agree or disagree, your response will return the ball to me.
And then it is my turn again.
I don't serve a new ball from my original starting line.
I hit your ball back again from where it has bounced.
I carry your idea further, or answer your questions or objections, or challenge or question you.
And so the ball goes back and forth.
</p>
<p>
If there are more than two people in the conversation, then it is like doubles in tennis, or like volleyball.
There's no waiting in line.
Whoever is nearest and quickest hits the ball, and if you step back, someone else will hit it.
No one stops the game to give you a turn.
You're responsible for taking your own turn.
</p>
<p>
But whether it's two players or a group, everyone does his or her best to keep the ball going, and no one person has the ball for very long.
</p>
<p>
A Japanese-style conversation, however, is not at all like tennis or volleyball.
It's like bowling.
You wait for your turn.
And you always know your place in line.
It depends on such things as whether you are older or younger, a close friend or a relative stranger to the previous speaker, in a senior or junior position, and so on.
</p>
<p>
When your turn comes, you step up to the starting line with your bowling ball and carefully bowl it.
Everyone else stands back and watches politely, murmuring encouragement.
Everyone waits until the ball has reached the end of the alley and watches to see if it knocks down all the pins, or only some of them, or none of them.
There is a pause, while everyone records your score.
</p>
<p>
Then, after everyone is sure that you have completely finished your turn, the next person in line steps up to the same starting line, with a different ball.
He doesn't return your ball, and he does not begin from where your ball stopped.
And there is always a suitable pause between turns.
There is no rush, no scramble for the ball.
</p>
<p>
No wonder everyone looked surprised when I took part in Japanese conversations.
I paid no attention to whose turn it was and kept snatching the ball halfway down the alley and throwing it back at the bowler.
Of course the conversation died.
I was playing the wrong game.
</p>
<p>
But if you have been trained all your life to play one game, it is no simple matter to change to another, even if you know the rules.
Knowing the rules is not at all the same thing as playing the game.
</p>
<p>
Even now, during a conversation in Japanese, I will notice a surprised reaction and realize, though a bit too late, that once again I have rudely interrupted.
It is no easier for me to "just listen" during a conversation than it is for my Japanese students to "just relax" when speaking with foreigners.
Now I can truly sympathize with how hard they must find it to try to carry on a Western-style conversation.
