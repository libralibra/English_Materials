<p class="storyTitle">Feminine Force</p><p>
The mere idea of becoming a successful career woman was once unheard of in Asia.
Parents made great effort to send their sons to university, but considered the thought of educating their daughters extremely foolish and a waste of time and money.
Like their mothers, girls were taught to cook and keep house.
</p>
<p>
Times change.
This situation has gone the way of bound feet, child brides and arranged marriages.
</p>
<p>
Rising levels of education have given rise to a new breed of Asian working women&#151;confident, competent and competitive executives.
Regional statistics show that women now contribute significantly to the workforce and, while men still have most of the top jobs, many women sit in such positions as presidents or managing directors.
</p>
<p>
Attitudes towards women have changed as well.
Gone is the fixed image of the Asian woman as quiet, obedient and willing to do household tasks.
At work, she can hold her own in the corporate rat race.
At home, she no longer takes a back seat in decision-making.
</p>
<p>
Advertising agencies and marketers realize this and aim commercials about fast-moving consumer products at the influential feminine purchaser.
</p>
<p>
The social status of women not only reflects their advancement and development, but also shows the level of social development of a country, and the progress achieved in human rights.
</p>
<p>
If the social status of women, who make up nearly half of China's 1.1 billion people, is advanced, there must also be a parallel improvement in human rights.
</p>
<p>
Until the establishment of the new China fifty years ago, human rights as well as the social rights of most women in China had been oppressed in political and social arenas, and at home by their husbands.
The establishment of the new China removed the roots of the oppression of women and put an end to inequality between men and women.
The way was paved for the liberalization of women.
</p>
<p>
Today, in most Chinese cities, the employment rate of women is very high&#151;only a few percent less than the employment rate of men.
</p>
<p>
Women in China are specially protected and insured at their work places, minimizing their working difficulties.
</p>
<p>
The economic independence of women in China has helped their political advancement and involvement in social activities.
</p>
<p>
Most of the women wish to gain the same qualifications, training and achievements as men.
Many women have confirmed their importance by contributing to their countries' political and economic development.
</p>
<p>
The fundamental historical changes in the social status of women in China have not only improved human rights worldwide, but have also encouraged women of all less developed countries to work hard to achieve their rights and benefits.
