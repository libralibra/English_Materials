<p class="storyTitle">E.T.&#151;A fairy Tale of the Space Age</p><p>
For many children the search for extra-terrestrial life or life from other planets may seem to be already over.
An extra-terrestrial has been with us for some time.
Children ask for shirts that read "E.T.&#151;I love you" and for E.T. toys under the Christmas tree.
Steven Spielberg's film, "E.T.&#151;the Extra-terrestrial", has become one of the biggest film money-makers of all time;
even ahead of "Star Wars".
</p>
<p>
What is it about this big-eyed creature from outer space that has made America's children and many adults so excited?
Psychologists say that the film of E.T., like ancient fairy tales, contains powerful stories that help children through the difficult process of growing up.
The message that fairy tales bring to the child is that a struggle against severe difficulties in life cannot be avoided, but that if one does not run away but meets unexpected and often unjust hardships, one masters all obstacles and at the end comes out victorious.
</p>
<p>
Today's children, who often grow up alone in homes that are separated from other children, need fairy tales even more than children did at the time when those tales were first told.
In E.T. they find a fairy tale with a special interest because it is set in the space age, which is closer to their situation than a story set in an old castle.
E.T. may not be good-looking physically, but he is totally harmless, kind and charming.
No child need fear an outer space filled with creatures like E.T.
</p>
<p>
The film has at least two heroes who children can understand and with whom they can share their feelings&#151;E.T. himself and Elliott, the 10-year-old boy who finds, looks after and saves the friendly and likable creature after he is left behind by his spaceship.
Both Elliott and E.T. have been left to look after themselves.
Elliott feels alone because his parents have separated, but he finds a magical friend whom he can protect and who provides him with friendship.
Children often have a strong need for imaginary playmates.
</p>
<p>
For all children, the film raises the question of the need to grow up and the desire to stay a child.
Elliott decides not to go with E.T. aboard the spaceship, where he could continue living in an imaginary world.
As one child said, "Elliott stayed on Earth because he has to grow up and you can't grow up on the faraway planet of Jupiter.
You stay small and a kid like E.T."
</p>
<p>
The film offers many ideas from the traditional fairy tale:
first, good children get the better of bad adults.
Secondly, the hero is put in a difficult position in the early stages of the story but there is a happy ending when he is finally rescued.
Thirdly, the film offers the idea of rebirth, which is found in many fairy tales.
Finally, the story also reminds one of "The Three Feathers" by the well-known writers of fairy tales&#151;the Grimm brothers.
In this story, the youngest son wins his father's kingdom by defeating his brothers with the help of an ugly old toad.
Put to a final test, to bring back the most beautiful woman, he wins again by choosing the toad who turns into a beauty.
Thus, it is love which turns even ugly things into something beautiful.
It's easy to see how that is true of E.T.
