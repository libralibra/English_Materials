<p class="storyTitle">Adult Education in the U.S.</p><p>
Ideas about education are changing in the United States.
Education today is not just a high school diploma or a college degree.
Many adults are not interested in going to college.
They are interested in other kinds of learning.
For them, learning does not end with a diploma.
</p>
<p>
Continuing education gives these adults the opportunity to increase their knowledge about their own field or to learn about a new field.
It also gives them a chance to improve their old skills or to learn new ones.
</p>
<p>
Secretaries, mechanics, and barbers can take classes to improve their work skills.
Nurses can take classes to increase their knowledge of nursing.
If they know more or learn more, then they can get a better job or earn more money.
</p>
<p>
Continuing education classes give some adults the chance to learn new skills.
There is usually a large variety of classes to choose from, typing, foreign cooking, photography, auto repair, furniture repair, or swimming.
These are only some of the classes available.
</p>
<p>
Some adults take classes for fun or because the class will be useful for them.
For example, they can choose a class in almost any language, Chinese, Spanish or English as a second language.
There are classes in first aid or classes in sewing.
There are also many other types of classes to choose from.
</p>
<p>
Other adults take continuing education classes to improve their own lives because they want to feel better about themselves.
Overweight people can find exercise classes or classes in nutrition.
Others can learn how to be good parents, or how to get along with other people.
</p>
<p>
There are many opportunities for adults to continue their learning.
Almost any community college or public school system has a continuing education program.
There are classes in schools, community buildings, or churches.
Most classes are in the evening, so working people can attend.
The classes are usually small, and they are inexpensive.
</p>
<p>
Thousands of people register for continuing education classes each year.
They receive no diploma or certificate, and no grade for most of the classes they attend.
For them, learning is something they do because they want to.
