<p class="storyTitle">People on the Move</p><p>
The history of the American people is, in part, the history of the movement of the American people.
They moved from the colonies of the East Coast to the open spaces of the West.
They moved from the country and the farm to the city.
More recently, Americans have been moving from the cities to the suburbs.
</p>
<p>
Open Space;
The Move West
</p>
<p>
Pioneer Americans began moving from the East Coast to the West 250 years ago.
They moved west for many reasons.
One reason was the availability of unlimited open space and land for farming.
Americans liked large open spaces, and they also liked the freedom and independence to develop the land in their own way.
Some of the land became farms.
Important minerals were discovered in some areas, so some of the land became mines.
Other large areas became cattle ranches.
There seemed to be enough land for everybody.
But it was a difficult life&#151;a life of endless work and hardship.
</p>
<p>
The Cities
</p>
<p>
After 1860, the Industrial Revolution changed the United States.
Americans learned how to manufacture steel.
They began to produce petroleum.
The automobile was invented.
Factories of all kinds began to appear, and cities began to grow up around the factories.
Farmers and other country people moved to the growing cities in order to find jobs and an easier life.
In the early 1900s, the cities were busy, exciting places.
However, there was also a lot of poverty and hardship.
</p>
<p>
The cities grew up&#151;the buildings got taller&#151;and the cities grew out&#151;they spread out from the center.
Private houses with yards and porches disappeared.
Apartment buildings, each one taller than the next, took their place.
More and more people moved to the cities, and the cities got bigger and bigger.
</p>
<p>
Some cities could not spread out because there was no room to do so.
These cities, of which New York is the best example, became more and more crowded.
More people meant more cars, trucks, and buses, more noise, more pollution, and more crime.
Many cities became ugly and dirty.
Some people and some businesses began to leave the cities and move to the suburbs outside the cities.
</p>
<p>
The Suburbs
</p>
<p>
The move to the suburbs is still happening.
Americans are looking for a small piece of land that they can call their own.
They want a house with a yard.
However, they do not want to give up the good jobs they have in the city.
In many cases, companies in the suburbs give them jobs.
In other cases, Americans tend to commute to and from the cities where their jobs are.
In recent years, more and more businesses are moving to the suburbs.
They are attracting many people and the suburbs are becoming crowded.
</p>
<p>
What Next?
</p>
<p>
Americans have watched their big cities fall slowly into disrepair and die.
Many middle-class people have left the cities, and only the very rich and the very poor are staying behind.
</p>
<p>
Concerned Americans are trying to solve the problems of noise, dirt, crime, and pollution in the big cities.
They are trying to rebuild bad sections of the cities in order to attract and keep business people.
They are trying to make their cities beautiful.
Now many Americans are thinking of moving back to the cities.
</p>
<p>
Other Americans are finding that even the suburbs have become too crowded.
They are looking for unpolluted open spaces and for an independent way of life.
They are ready to move from the suburbs to the country.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps Americans will always be on the move.
