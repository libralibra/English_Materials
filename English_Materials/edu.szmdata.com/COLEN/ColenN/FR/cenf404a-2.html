<p class="storyTitle">The Suburban Century</p><p>
The United States is a nation of suburbs.
The 1990 census makes it official.
Nearly half the country's population now lives in suburbs, up from a quarter in 1950 and a third in 1960.
</p>
<p>
The third century of American history is shaping up as the suburban century.
Until 1920 most Americans lived in rural areas.
By 1960 the country was a third urban, a third rural, and a third suburban.
That balance didn't last long, however.
By 1990 the urban population had slipped to 31 percent and the rural population was down to less than a quarter.
We are now a suburban nation with an urban fringe and a rural fringe.
</p>
<p>
The first century of American life was dominated by the rural myth:
the sturdy and self-reliant Jeffersonian farmer.
By the end of the nineteenth century, however, Americans were getting off the farms as fast as they could, to escape the hardship and brutality of rural life.
</p>
<p>
Most of the twentieth century has been dominated by the urban myth:
the melting pot;
New York, New York;
the cities as the nation's great engines of prosperity and culture.
All the while, however, Americans have been getting out of the cities as soon as they can afford to buy a house and a car.
They want to escape the crowding and dangers of urban life.
But there is more to it than escape.
As Kenneth T. Jackson argues in Crabgrass Frontier, a history of suburbanization in the United States, the pull factors (cheap housing and the ideal of a suburban "dream house") have been as important as the push factors (population growth and racial prejudice).
</p>
<p>
The 1990 Census tells the story of the explosive growth of suburbs.
That year fourteen states had a majority suburban population, including six of the ten most populous states (California, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, Florida, and New Jersey).
</p>
<p>
Suburban growth is not likely to end anytime soon.
According to the polls, 43 percent of Boston residents, 48 percent of people who live in Los Angeles, and 60 percent of those who live in New York City say they would leave the city if they could.
When the Gallup Poll asked Americans in 1989 what kind of place they would like to live in, only 19 percent said a city.
</p>
<p>
Is there a suburban myth?
Sure there is.
It has been a staple of American popular culture since the 1950s, from television shows like The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet and Leave It to Beaver to movies like E.T. The debunking of the suburban myth has now reached American popular culture, where television comedies about lower middle-class families like Roseanne and the Simpsons portray the harsh realities of suburban life&#151;unemployment, troubled families, and, above all, stress.
