<p class="storyTitle">08. Going Vegetarian&#151;The Healthy Way</p>
<p>You've decided: That succulent steak you ate last night will be your last. You're going to become a vegetarian. There was a time when being a vegetarian was considered radical or eccentric. Today, quite a large percentage of people call themselves vegetarians, and nutrition experts say a plant-based diet has some powerful health benefits.</p>
<p>But a vegetarian diet isn't automatically healthier. You need to arm yourself with the facts to get the most from your new lifestyle. As you start out you may have to put a little more effort into meeting your nutritional needs.</p>
<p class="subTitle">What Kind of Vegetarian Do You Want to Be?</p>
<p>Most vegetarians don't eat meat, poultry or fish. Their diets consist of plant-based foods such as vegetables, fruits, grains, legumes (peas and beans), nuts and seeds. Eggs, dairy products or both may also be included. Vegetarians known as vegans (VEE-guns) don't eat any animal products, including eggs, dairy foods, or even honey. Others who occasionally eat meat, usually chicken and fish, may also call themselves vegetarians. Although they're only part-time vegetarians, they may still reap many of the same health benefits enjoyed by their meatless counterparts.</p>
<p class="subTitle">The Pros of Plants</p>
<p>Some people choose a vegetarian diet for religious, ethical or environmental reasons. But most become vegetarians because they want to be healthier.</p>
<p>Vegetarians have lower rates of some cancers, heart disease, high blood pressure and diabetes. A study of nearly 2&#160;000 vegetarians and part-time vegetarians conducted by German cancer researchers found eating little or no meat cut death rates from heart disease in half and deaths from cancer by 25 to 50 percent. Vegetarians are also less likely to have gallstones, kidney stones and constipation and they weigh less on average.</p>
<p class="subTitle">Filling Your Nutritional Bill</p>
<p>The more you restrict your diet, the more difficult it is to get all the nutrients you need. A vegan diet, for example, eliminates food sources of vitamin B-12 and some of the best sources of calcium. Other nutrients, such as vitamin D and zinc, are available in a meatless diet, but you'll need to make a special effort to make sure they're in yours.</p>
<p>Growing children, pregnant or breast-feeding women, older people and those who've been ill should proceed with caution when considering a vegetarian diet because of their special nutritional needs.</p>
<p class="subTitle">The Vegetarian Starting Block</p>
<p>Scraping the meat off your plate and eating what's left is not the healthy way to go vegetarian. You're likely to be hungry afterward and you're shortchanging yourself nutritionally.</p>
<p class="subTitle">Here Are a Few of the Best Ways to Start Out</p>
<p><b>Easy does it.</b> You don't have to go "cold turkey." Take some time to learn more about the nutritional aspects of your new diet before you go meatless. Substitute non-meat dishes several times a week. Remember, suddenly eating more high-fiber fruits, vegetables and grains can leave you feeling bloated and gassy. Your body will adapt more easily if you add fiber slowly.</p>
<p><b>Variety is the key.</b> Select an array of foods to make sure you get all the nutrients you need. Soy products such as tofu or soy meat substitutes, legumes, lentils, nuts, seeds and whole grains are a good source of protein, while non- or low-fat milk and milk products are calcium rich. If you're a vegan, nondairy sources for calcium include leafy, dark green vegetables, legumes, fortified soy milk and tofu (processed with calcium sulfate). Women need at least 1&#160;000 milligrams of calcium each day.</p>
<p>Enriched cereals and whole grain products, leafy, dark green vegetables, legumes and prune juice are a good place to start with for iron. You can also increase iron absorption by eating vitamin C-rich foods such as tomatoes or by cooking in iron pans. Try whole grains, soy products, nuts and wheat germ for zinc and dairy products and eggs will give you a good supply of vitamin B-12.</p>
<p class="subTitle">Practice Makes Perfect</p>
<p>Because you're changing the way you eat, you'll also be changing the way you cook and shop. At first, you may not be able to whip up a quickie vegetarian meal the way you used to throw together a meat-and-potatoes one. But as you gain knowledge and experience and a few recipes your new vegetarian diet will seem like second nature to you.</p>
