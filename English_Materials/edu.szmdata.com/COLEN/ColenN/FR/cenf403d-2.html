<p class="storyTitle">The Kind of Work Daddy Does</p><p>
It is not surprising that modern children tend to look blank and dispirited when informed that they will someday have to "go to work and make a living."
The fact is they cannot visualize what work is in corporate America.
</p>
<p>
Not so long ago, when a parent said he was off to work, the child knew very well what was about to happen.
His parent was going to make something or fix something.
The parent could take his offspring to his place of business and let him watch while he repaired a car or built a table.
</p>
<p>
When a child asked, "What kind of work do you do, Daddy?" his father could answer in terms that a child could come to grips with.
 "I fix steam engines."
 "I make horse collars."
</p>
<p>
Well, a few fathers still fix engines and build things, but most do not.
Nowadays, most fathers sit in glass buildings performing tasks that are absolutely incomprehensible to children.
The answers they gave when asked, "What kind of work do you do, Daddy?" are likely to be very puzzling to the child.
</p>
<p>
 "I sell space."
 "I do market research."
 "I am a data processor."
 "I am in public relations."
 "I am a systems analyst."
Such explanations must seem nonsense to a child.
How can he possibly imagine anyone analyzing a system or researching a market?
</p>
<p>
Even grown men who do market research have trouble visualizing what a public relations man does with his day, and it is a safe bet that the average systems analyst is as puzzled about what a space salesman does at the shop as the average space salesman is about the tools needed to analyze a system.
</p>
<p>
In the common everyday job, nothing is made any more.
Things are now made by machines.
Very little is repaired.
The machines that make things make them in such a fashion that they will quickly fall apart in such a way that repairs will be too expensive.
Thus the buyer is encouraged to throw the thing away and buy a new one.
In effect, the machines are making junk.
</p>
<p>
The handful of people remotely associated with these machines can, of course, tell their inquisitive children "Daddy makes junk."
Most of the work force, however, is too remote from junk production to sense any contribution to the industry.
What do these people do?
</p>
<p>
Consider the typical twelve-story glass building in the typical American city.
Nothing is being made in this building and nothing is being repaired, including the building itself.
Constructed as a piece of junk, the building will be discarded when it wears out, and another piece of junk will be set in its place.
</p>
<p>
Still, the building is filled with people who think of themselves as working.
At any given moment during the day perhaps one-third of them will be talking into telephones.
Most of these conversations will be about paper for paper is what occupies nearly everyone in this building.
</p>
<p>
Some jobs in the building require men to fill paper with words.
There are persons who type neatly on paper and persons who read paper and jot notes in the margins.
Some persons make copies of paper and other persons deliver paper.
There are persons who file paper and persons who unfile paper.
</p>
<p>
Some persons mail paper.
Some persons telephone other persons and ask that paper be sent to them.
Others telephone to ascertain the whereabouts of paper.
Some persons confer about paper.
In the grandest offices, men approve of some paper and disapprove of other paper.
</p>
<p>
The elevators are filled throughout the day with young men carrying paper from floor to floor and with vital men carrying paper to be discussed with other vital men.
</p>
<p>
What is a child to make of all this?
His father may be so important that he lunches with other men about paper.
Suppose he brings his son to work to give the boy some idea of what work is all about.
What does the boy see happening?
</p>
<p>
His father calls for paper.
He reads paper.
Perhaps he makes an angry red mark on paper.
He telephones another man and says they had better lunch over paper.
</p>
<p>
At lunch they talk about paper.
Back at the office, the father orders the paper retyped and reproduced in quintuplicate, and then sent to another man for comparison with paper that was reproduced in triplicate last year.
</p>
<p>
Imagine his poor son afterwards thinking about the mysteries of work with a friend, who asks him, "What does your father do?"
What can the boy reply?
 "It beats me," perhaps, if he is not very observant.
Or if he is, "Something that has to do with making junk, I think.
Same as everybody else."
</p>
