<p class="storyTitle">Coming to an Awareness of Language</p><p>
It was because of my letters (which Malcolm X wrote to people outside while he was in jail) that I happened to stumble upon starting to acquire some kind of a homemade education.
</p>
<p>
I became increasingly frustrated at not being able to express what I wanted to convey in letters that I wrote&#160;...&#160;
And every book I picked up had few sentences which didn't contain anywhere from one to nearly all the words that might as well have been in Chinese.
When I skipped those words, of course, I really ended up with little idea of what the book said&#160;...&#160;
</p>
<p>
I saw that the best thing I could do was get hold of a dictionary&#151;to study, to learn some words.
I requested a dictionary along with some notebooks and pencils from the Norfolk Prison Colony school.
</p>
<p>
I spent two days just turning uncertainly the pages of a dictionary.
I'd never realized so many words existed!
I didn't know which words I needed to learn.
Finally, just to start some kind of action, I began copying.
</p>
<p>
In my slow, painstaking, ragged handwriting, I copied into my notebook everything printed on that first page, down to the punctuation marks.
I believe it took me a day.
Then, aloud, I read back to myself everything I'd written in the notebook.
Over and over, aloud, to myself, I read my own handwriting.
I woke up the next morning, thinking about those words&#151;immensely proud to realize that not only had I written so much at one time, but I'd written words that I never knew were in the world.
Moreover, with a little effort, I also could remember what many of these words meant.
I reviewed the words whose meanings I didn't remember.
Funny thing, from the dictionary's first page right now, that aardvark springs to my mind.
The dictionary had a picture of it, a long-tailed, long-eared, burrowing African mammal, which lives off termites caught by sticking out its tongue as an anteater does for ants.
</p>
<p>
I was so fascinated that I went on&#151;I copied the dictionary's next page.
And the same experience came when I studied that.
With every succeeding page, I also learned of people and places and events from history.
Actually, the dictionary is like a miniature encyclopedia.
Finally, the dictionary's A section had filled a whole notebook&#151;and I went on into the B 's.
That was the way I started copying what eventually became the entire dictionary.
It went a lot faster after so much practice helped me to pick up handwriting speed.
</p>
<p>
I suppose it was inevitable that as my word-base broadened, I could for the first time pick up a book and read and now begin to understand what the book was saying.
Anyone who has read a great deal can imagine the new world that opened.
Let me tell you something:
from then until I left the prison, in every free moment I had, if I was not reading in the library, I was reading on my bunk.
You couldn't have gotten me out of books with a wedge.
Months passed without my even thinking about being imprisoned.
In fact, up to then, I never had been so truly free in my life.
</p>
