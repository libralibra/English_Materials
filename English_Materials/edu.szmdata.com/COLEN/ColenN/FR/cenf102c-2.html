<p class="storyTitle">Friends</p><p>
It was Saturday morning.
Nicky and I were just finishing our shopping.
 "Let me see&#160;...&#160;"
Nicky said.
 "We've been to the supermarket, the baker's and the greengrocer's&#160;...&#160;
Is that the lot?"
</p>
<p>
I looked at my list.
 "I just need a couple of things from the chemist 's," I told her.
 "All right," Nicky said.
 "While you're doing that, I'll just call in at the bookshop."
</p>
<p>
We arranged to meet at a caf&#233; in a quarter of an hour.
I arrived first.
When Nicky came in, she looked quite excited.
</p>
<p>
 "Did you find your book, then?"
I asked as she sat down.
</p>
<p>
 "Yes," Nicky said.
</p>
<p>
 "Something special?"
I asked.
I was curious because Nicky was not a great reader, except for newspapers and magazines.
She sometimes borrowed books, but she rarely bought them.
</p>
<p>
 "Well, yes," Nicky admitted.
</p>
<p>
 "What's all the mystery?"
I asked.
 "Tell me all about it!"
</p>
<p>
 "It isn't exactly a mystery, Kay," Nicky began.
I waited for her to go on.
 "Well, do you remember that woman who used to live opposite the church&#151;Miss Hunter?"
</p>
<p>
 "The one who used to wear funny clothes and had a large dog?
Wasn't she an artist?"
</p>
<p>
 "Well, yes," Nicky said.
 "She did paint&#151;but only as a hobby.
As a matter of fact, she was a writer&#151;and I've just bought her latest book!"
Nicky took the book out of her bag and passed it across the table.
The title was "Death Comes to the Village".
</p>
<p>
 "A detective story," I said.
 "Hey, do you think we're in it?"
</p>
<p>
 "I'm pretty sure I am," Nicky said, looking rather pleased with herself.
 "You see, Miss Hunter and I were quite good friends and she often said she was going to put me into her next book!"
</p>
<p>
 "Shall we have a look?"
I asked.
But Nicky picked the book up and put it in her bag.
 "I'd like to read it first," she said.
 "But I'll lend it to you, of course&#160;...&#160;"
</p>
<p>
Some time passed after our meeting in the caf&#233;" and I heard nothing from Nicky.
I decided to ring her up and ask about the book.
 "Oh, that!" she said in a small voice.
</p>
<p>
 "You don't sound very pleased," I said.
 "Weren't you in the book after all?"
</p>
<p>
 "Yes," Nicky said.
 "I'm in the book all right!
But who do you think I am?
I'm the village post woman!
I pass on all the gossip in the village!
I even open letters sometimes!
I'm the most unpleasant person in the whole book!
That woman is no friend of mine, I can tell you!"
</p>
