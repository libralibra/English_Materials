<p class="storyTitle">Two Kinds</p><p>
My mother believed you could be anything you wanted to be in America.
You could open a restaurant.
You could work for the government and get good retirement benefits.
You could buy a house with almost no money down.
You could become rich.
You could become instantly famous.
</p>
<p>
 "Of course you can be a talented child or what they call a wonder girl, too," my mother told me when I was nine.
 "You can be best at anything.
What does Auntie Lindo know?
Her daughter, at best she is only tricky."
</p>
<p>
America was where all my mother's hopes lay.
She had come here in 1975 after losing everything in Vietnam? her mother and father, her family home, her first husband, and two daughters, twin baby girls.
But she never looked back with regret.
There were so many ways for things to get better.
</p>
<p>
Every night after dinner, my mother and I would sit at the kitchen table.
She would present new tests, taking her examples from stories of amazing children she had read in Ripley's Believe It or Not, or Good Housekeeping, Reader's Digest, and a dozen other magazines she kept in a pile in our bathroom.
My mother got these magazines from people whose houses she cleaned.
And since she cleaned many houses each week, we had a great collection.
She would look through them all, searching for stories about remarkable children.
</p>
<p>
The first night she brought out a story about a three-year-old boy who knew the capitals of all the states and even most of the European countries.
A teacher was quoted as saying the little boy could also, pronounce the names of the foreign cities correctly.
</p>
<p>
 "What's the capital of Finland?" my mother asked me, looking at the magazine story.
</p>
<p>
All I knew was the capital of California, because Sacramento was the name of the street we lived on in Chinatown.
 "Nairobi!"
I guessed, saying the most foreign word I could think of.
She checked to see if that was possibly one way to pronounce "Helsinki" before showing me the answer.
</p>
<p>
The tests got harder&#151;multiplying numbers in my head, finding the queen of hearts in a deck of cards, trying to stand on my head without using my hands, predicting the daily temperatures in Los Angeles, New York, and London.
</p>
<p>
One night I had to look at a page from the Bible for three minutes and then report everything I could remember.
 "Now Jehoshaphat had riches and honor in abundance and, that's all I remember, Ma," I said.
</p>
<p>
And after seeing my mother's disappointed face once again, something inside of me began to die.
I hated the tests, the raised hopes and failed expectations.
Before going to bed that night, I looked in the mirror above the bathroom sink and when I saw only my face staring back&#151;and that it would always be this ordinary face&#151;I began to cry.
Such a sad, ugly girl!
I made noises like an angry animal, trying to scratch out the face in the mirror.
</p>
<p>
And then I saw what seemed to be the talented side of me&#151;because I had never seen that face before.
I looked at my reflection, blinking so I could see more clearly.
The girl staring back at me was angry, powerful.
This girl and I were the same.
I had new thoughts, thoughts filled with lots of won'ts.
I won't let her change me, I promised myself.
I won't be what I'm not.
</p>
