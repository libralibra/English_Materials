<p class="storyTitle">31. The Appeal and Drawbacks of Gambling</p>
<p>There is evidence to believe that gambling in many forms has been engaged in for almost as long as civilization. Even in primitive tribes today there exist games of chance that give rise to our suspicion that gambling may have begun when our ancestors were wearing skins and hunting and gathering food. There seems to be something in the human psyche that is fascinated by the prospect of gaining much by venturing little. Yet it is clearly stated in all religions, at least in the better known ones, that gambling is abominable. In several countries of the world gambling is prohibited at least in certain forms and sometimes severely restricted. This gives rise to the assumption that most governments, if not all, see gambling as evil. Now what is it in gambling that has so much appeal?</p>
<p>Strange though it may seem, many people who gamble and aim to win are those who do not need the large amounts of money that they want to win. We see rich men and women, who have enough wealth to live more than comfortably their whole lives, gambling and hoping to win large sums of money which they really don't need. Often it has turned out that these people gamble for the thrill of it. It seems that the possibility that they might lose large sums of money or even be ruined is a thrill much like motor racing or bungy jumping. Rich men and women have been known to spend almost their whole lives frequenting gambling houses and there trying to ruin people and run the risk of ruining themselves. Since gamblers consider this a game and all they seek are thrills, they believe they are harming no one but people who seek similar thrills. Hence the popular appeal of gambling.</p>
<p>Another appeal is of course that if a player who is not so rich should suddenly make a big strike, then he is assured of a comfortable life. Gambling which can make a man rich beyond his dreams may be comparatively the harmless types&#151;like lotteries, many of which are state run. In some countries many of the lotteries are means of raising money for charity. The appeal is that one hopes to spend a few dollars on tickets and hopes to win enormous sums of money. If he fails then his contribution helps some charitable cause.</p>
<p>In spite of its appeal, gambling has the reputation of having ruined countless men and women all over the world. One main drawback is that gambling is addictive. Some people can take gambling so seriously that it becomes an obsession. They spend everything they have and all their time gambling&#151;at the neglect of family, friends and even their own health. It is intriguing that people who win at gambling and people who lose too can become hopeless addicts. People who win seem to think that since they have a "lucky streak" they can win even more, often they indulge in it until they have lost what they had won and more. As for those who lose, the temptation is even greater. They want so much to win what they have lost that they play with money they do not have&#151;like borrowed money. Everyone wants that one great opportunity to win a great sum and retire, but alas!, such a situation seldom, if ever, rises. Eventually there are very few winners in gambling. Most gamblers lose.</p>
<p>Hence the drawbacks of gambling are most destructive. They can wipe out families and ruin the lives of individuals. Whatever appeal they may have, it is well that in most countries in the world they are kept under strict rules and are sometimes banned.</p>
