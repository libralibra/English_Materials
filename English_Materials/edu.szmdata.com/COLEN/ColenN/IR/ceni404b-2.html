<p class="storyTitle">WHAT's AMERICAN ABOUT AMERICA?</p>
<p class="storyAuthor">Ishmael Reed</p>
<p>
An item from the New York Times, June 23, 1983:
 "At the annual Lower East Side Jewish Festival yesterday, a Chinese woman ate a pizza slice in front of Ty Thuan Due's Vietnamese grocery store.
Beside her a Spanish-speaking family patronized a cart with two signs:
 'Italian Ices' and 'Kosher by Rabbi Alper'."
</p>
<p>
On the day before Memorial Day, 1983, a poet called me to describe a city he had just visited.
He said that one section included mosques, built by the Islamic people who dwelled there.
Attending his reading, he said, were large numbers of Hispanic people, 40,000 of whom lived in the same city.
He was not talking about a legendary city located in some mysterious region of the world.
The city he'd visited was Detroit.
</p>
<p>
A few months before, as I was visiting Texas, I heard the taped voice used to guide passengers to their connections at the Dallas Airport announcing items in both Spanish and English.
This trend is likely to continue:
after all, for some southwestern states like Texas, where the largest minority is now Mexican-American.
Spanish was the first written language and the Spanish style lives on in the western way of life.
</p>
<p>
Shortly after my Texas trip, I sat in a campus auditorium at the University of Wisconsin at Milwaukee as a Yale professor&#151;whose original work on the influence of African cultures upon those of the Americas has led to his ostracism from some intellectual circles&#151;walked up and down the aisle like an old-time Southern evangelist, dancing and drumming the top of the lectern, illustrating his points before some Afro-American intellectuals and artists who cheered and applauded his performance.
The professor was "white."
After his lecture, he conversed with a group of Milwaukeeans&#151;all of whom spoke Yoruban, though only the professor had ever traveled to Africa.
</p>
<p>
One of the artists there told me that his paintings, which included African and Afro-American mythological symbols and imagery, were hanging in the local McDonald's restaurant.
The next day I went to McDonald's and snapped pictures of smiling youngsters eating hamburgers below paintings that could grace the walls of any of the country's leading museums.
The manager of the local McDonald's said, "I don't know what you boys are doing, but I like it," as he commissioned the local painters to exhibit in his restaurant.
</p>
<p>
Such blurring of cultural styles occurs in everyday life in the United States to a greater extent than anyone can imagine.
Yet members of the nation's present educational and cultural elite still cling to the notion that the United States belongs to some vaguely defined entity they refer to as ' Western civilization," by which they mean, presumably, a civilization created by people of Europe, as if Europe can even be viewed as completely uninfluenced by the rest of the world.
Is Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, which includes Turkish marches, a part of Western civilization?
Or the late-nineteenth- and twentieth-century French paintings, whose creators were influenced by Japanese art?
And what of the cubists, through whom the influence of African art changed modern painting?
Or the surrealists, who were so impressed with the art of the Pacific Northwest Indians that, in their map of North America, Alaska dwarfs the lower forty-eight states in size?
</p>
<p>
Are the Russians, who are often criticized for their adoption of "Western" ways by Tsarist dissidents in exile, members of Western civilization?
And what of the millions of Europeans who have black African and Asian ancestry, black Africans having occupied several European countries for hundreds of years?
Are these "Europeans" a part of Western civilization?
Or the Hungarians, who originated across the Urals in a place called Greater Hungary?
Or the Irish, who came from the Iberian Peninsula?
</p>
<p>
Even the notion that North America is part of Western civilization because our "system of government" is derived from Europe is being challenged by Native American historians who say that the founding fathers, Benjamin Franklin especially, were actually influenced by the system of government that had been adopted by the Iroquois hundreds of years prior to the arrival of Europeans.
</p>
<p>
Western civilization, then, becomes another confusing category&#151;like Third World, or Judeo-Christian culture&#151;as humanity attempts to impose its small-screen view of political and cultural reality upon a complex world.
Our most publicized novelist recently said that Western civilization was the greatest achievement of mankind&#151;an attitude that flourishes on the street level as scribbles in public restrooms:
 "White Power."
 "Niggers and Spies Suck" or "Hitler was a prophet."
Where did such an attitude, which has caused so much misery and depression in our national life, which has spoiled even our noblest achievements, begin?
An attitude that caused the confinement of Japanese-American citizens during World War II, the persecution of Chicanos and Chinese Americans, the near-extermination of the Indians, and the murder and lynchings of thousands of Afro-Americans.
</p>
<p>
The Puritans of New England are idealized in our schoolbooks as the first Americans, "a hardy band" whose discipline razed the forest and brought order to the New World (a term that annoys Native American historians).
Industrious, responsible, it was their "Yankee ingenuity" and practicality that created the work ethic.
</p>
<p>
The Puritans, however, had a mean streak.
They hated the theater and banned Christmas.
They punished people in a cruel and inhuman manner.
They killed children who disobeyed their parents.
They exterminated the Indians, who had taught them how to survive in a world unknown to them.
The Puritan legacy of hard work and meticulous accounting led to the establishment of a great industrial society, but there was the other side&#151;the strange and fearful attitudes of that society toward those different from the elect.
</p>
<p>
The cultural attitudes of that early elect continue to be voiced in everyday life in the United States;
the president of a distinguished university, writing a letter to the Times, belittling the study of African civilizations;
the television network that promoted its show on the Vatican art with the boast that this art represented "the finest achievements of the human spirit."
</p>
<p>
When I heard a schoolteacher warn the other night about the invasion of the American educational system by foreign curricula, I wanted to yell at the television set, "Lady, they're already here."
It has already begun because the world is here.
The world has been arriving at these shores for at least 10,000 years from Europe, Africa, and Asia.
In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, large numbers of Europeans arrived, adding their cultures to those of the European, African, and Asian settlers who were already here, and recently millions have been entering the country from South America and the Caribbean.
</p>
<p>
North America deserves a more exciting destiny than as a storeroom of "Western civilization."
We can become a place where the cultures of the world crisscross.
This is possible because the United States and Canada are unique in the world:
The world is here.
