<p class="storyTitle">FOURTEEN STEPS</p>
<p class="storyAuthor">Hal Manwaring</p>
<p>
They say a cat has nine lives, and I am inclined to think that possible since I am now living my third life and I'm not even a cat.
</p>
<p>
My first life began on a clear, cold day in November, 1904, when I arrived as the sixth of eight children of a farming family.
My father died when I was 15, and we had a hard struggle to make a living.
I had to wait until the early years of my marriage before I really began to enjoy my first life.
But then I was very happy, in excellent health, and quite a good athlete.
My wife and I became the parents of two lovely girls.
I had a good job in San Jose and a beautiful home in San Carlos.
</p>
<p>
Life was a pleasant dream.
</p>
<p>
Then the dream ended and became one of those horrible nightmares that cause you to wake in a cold sweat in the middle of the night.
I began to suffer from a slowly progressive disease of the motor nerves, affecting first my right arm and leg, and then my other side.
</p>
<p>
Thus began my second life &hellip;.
</p>
<p>
In spite of my disease I still drove to and from work each day, with the aid of special equipment installed in my car.
And I managed to keep healthy and optimistic, to a degree, because of 14 steps.
</p>
<p>
Crazy?
Not at all.
</p>
<p>
Our home was a split-level affair with 14 steps leading up from the garage to the kitchen door.
Those steps were my yardstick, my challenge to continue living.
I felt that if me day arrived when I was unable to lift one foot up one step and then drag the other painfully after it&#151;repeating the process 14 times until, utterly spent, I would be through&#151;I could then admit defeat and lie down and die.
</p>
<p>
So I kept on working, kept on climbing those steps.
And time passed.
The girls went to college and were happily married, and my wife and I were alone in our beautiful home with the 14 steps.
</p>
<p>
You might think that here walked a man of courage and strength.
Not so.
Here hobbled a bitterly disillusioned cripple, a man who held on to his sanity and his wife and his home and his job because of 14 miserable steps leading up to the back door from his garage.
</p>
<p>
As I became older, I became more disillusioned and frustrated.
I'm sure that my wife and friends had some unhappy times when I chose to talk about my philosophy of life.
I believed that in this whole world I alone had been chosen to suffer.
I had carried my cross now for nine years and probably would bear it for as long as I could climb those 14 steps.
</p>
<p>
Then on a dark night in August, 1971, I began my third life.
It was raining when I started home that night, beating down hard on the car as I drove slowly down one of the less-traveled roads.
Suddenly the steering wheel jumped in my hands as one of the tires burst with a bang.
I fought the car to a stop and sat there as the terrible nature of the situation swept over me.
It was impossible for me to change that tire!
Utterly impossible!
</p>
<p>
A thought that a passing motorist might stop was dismissed at once.
Why should anyone?
I knew I wouldn't!
Then I remembered that a short distance up a little side road was a house.
I started the engine and drove slowly along until I came to the house;
Lighted windows welcomed me as I pulled into the driveway and honked the horn.
</p>
<p>
The door opened and a little girl stood there, peering at me.
I rolled down the window and called out that I had a flat and needed someone to change it for me because I had a crutch and couldn't do it myself.
</p>
<p>
She went into the house and a moment later came out bundled in raincoat and hat, followed by a man who called a cheerful greeting.
</p>
<p>
I sat there comfortable and dry, and felt a bit sorry for the man and the little girl working so hard in the storm.
Well, I would pay them for it.
The rain seemed to be easing a bit now, and I rolled down the window to watch.
It seemed to me that they were awfully slow and I was beginning to become impatient.
I heard the little girl's voice from the back of the car.
 "Here's the jack-handle, Grandpa."
She was answered by the murmur of the man's lower voice and the slow tilting of the car as it was jacked up.
</p>
<p>
There followed a long interval of noises and low conversation from the back of the car, but finally it was done.
I felt the car bump as the jack was removed, and I heard the slam of the trunk lid, and then they were standing at my car window.
</p>
<p>
He was an old man, bent and slightly built.
The little girl was about eight or ten, I judged, with a merry face and a wide smile as she looked up at me.
</p>
<p>
He said, "This is a bad night for car trouble, but you're all set now."
</p>
<p>
 "Thanks," I said, "thanks.
How much do I owe you?"
</p>
<p>
He shook his head.
 "Nothing.
Cynthia told me you were on crutches.
Glad to be of help.
I know you'd do the same for me.
There's no charge, friend."
</p>
<p>
I held out a five-dollar bill.
 "No!
I like to pay my way."
</p>
<p>
He made no effort to take it and the little girl stepped closer to the window and said quietly, "Grandpa can't see it."
</p>
<p>
In the next few frozen seconds the shame and horror of that moment penetrated, and I was sick with an intensity I had never felt before.
A blind man and a child!
Feeling with cold, wet fingers for bolts and tools in the dark&#151;a darkness that for him would probably never end until death.
</p>
<p>
They changed a tire for me&#151;changed it in the rain and wind, with me sitting in comfort in the car with my crutch.
I don't remember how long I sat there after they said good night and left me, but it was long enough for me to search deep within myself and find some disturbing traits.
</p>
<p>
I realized that I was filled to overflowing with self-pity, selfishness, and indifference to the needs of others.
</p>
<p>
I sat there and said a prayer.
I prayed for strength, for a greater understanding, for keener awareness of my shortcomings.
</p>
<p>
I prayed for blessings upon the blind man and his granddaughter.
Finally I drove away, shaken in mind, humbled in spirit.
</p>
<p>
I am trying now not only to climb 14 steps each day, but in my small way to help others.
Someday, perhaps, I'll have the chance to help a blind man in equal difficulties&#151;someone as blind as I had been.
</p>
