<p class="storyTitle">2. The Nose on Your Face</p>
<p>The human nose has given to the languages of the world many interesting expressions. Of course, this is not surprising. Without the nose, we could not breathe or smell. It is the part of the face that gives a person special character. Cyrano de Bergerac said that a large nose showed a great man&#151;courageous, courteous, manly, and intellectual.</p>
<p>A famous woman poet wished that she had two noses to smell a rose! Blaise Pascal, a French philosopher, made an interesting comment about Cleopatra's nose. If it had been shorter, he said, it would have changed the whole face of the world!</p>
<p>Historically, man's nose has had a principal role in his imagination. Man has referred to the nose in many ways to express his emotions. Expressions concerning the nose refer to human weakness: anger, pride, jealousy and revenge.</p>
<p>In English there are a number of phrases about the nose. For example, to hold up one's nose expresses a basic human feeling&#151;pride. People can hold up their noses at people, things, and places.</p>
<p>The phrase, to be led around by the nose, shows man's weakness. A person who is led around by the nose lets other people control him. On the other hand, a person who follows his nose lets his instinct guide him.</p>
<p>For the human emotion of rejection, the phrase to have one's nose put out of joint is very descriptive. The expression applies to persons who have been turned aside because of a competitor. Their pride is hurt and they feel rejected. This expression is not new. It was used by Erasmus in 1542.</p>
<p>This is only a sampling of expressions in English dealing with the nose. There are a number of others. However, it should be as plain as the nose on your face that the nose is more than an organ for breathing and smelling!</p>
