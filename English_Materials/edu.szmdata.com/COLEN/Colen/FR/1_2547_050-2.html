<tr><td class="roles">Jim: </td><td>Which tooth was it?</td></tr>
<tr><td class="roles">Andrew: </td><td>The last one on the upper right-hand side. It has a huge filling in it now.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="roles">Jim: </td><td>I hate having my teeth filled. It's not just the pain I hate. I hate the sound of drilling.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="roles">Andrew: </td><td>So do I. I'd rather have a tooth pulled than filled.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="roles">Jim: </td><td>Have you ever had one of your teeth pulled?</td></tr>
<tr><td class="roles">Andrew: </td><td>No, but the one the dentist just filled will have to come out someday. He says it can't be filled again.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="roles">Jim: </td><td>Teeth keep causing trouble, and nobody really does anything about it. I can't understand why.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="roles">Andrew: </td><td>They can put men on the moon, but they can't keep people from having trouble with teeth.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="roles">Jim: </td><td>Why can't they transplant teeth the way they transplant hearts? They can give some body a different heart. Why can't they give him different teeth?</td></tr>
<tr><td class="roles">Andrew: </td><td>I've heard they're working on that. My dentist says they're working on tooth transplants right now.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="roles">Jim: </td><td>On second thought, I'm not sure I'd want to eat with some other person's teeth.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="roles">Andrew: </td><td>Well, that's not how it works. The idea is to develop a plastic tooth that can be put into the hole where your own tooth came out.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="roles">Jim: </td><td>Really? What makes it stay there?</td></tr>
<tr><td class="roles">Andrew: </td><td>So far they haven't tried it with people, but they've made it work with baboons.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="roles">Jim: </td><td>Do they hook the plastic tooth to the teeth beside it?</td></tr>
<tr><td class="roles">Andrew: </td><td>No. The plastic tooth is made with plastic roots, and after a while the gums grow around the roots, so the tooth can't fall out.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="roles">Jim: </td><td>Are you making this up?</td></tr>
<tr><td class="roles">Andrew: </td><td>No! Seriously, somebody at the Georgetown University Hospital in Washington has been working on it.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="roles">Jim: </td><td>Well, it sounds like a good idea.</td></tr>
