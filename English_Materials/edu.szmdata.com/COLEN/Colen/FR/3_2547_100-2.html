<p class="storyTitle">20. Mackenzie's First Exploration</p>
<p>Alexander Mackenzie was the first man to travel across the continent of North America all the way from the east coast to the west coast. He had set out to find a sea route which would link the Atlantic Ocean with the Pacific. The route was to be called the Northwest Passage.</p>
<p>Having been brought up in the remote northernmost part of Scotland's Western Isles, Mackenzie had experienced the hardships which can be caused by extreme cold. He added to this experience by working as a young man for the Hudson's Bay Company in North America. This company, which was founded in 1670, had an almost complete monopoly of the rich fur trade in the Northwest Territories. Mackenzie worked for several years at the company's lonely trading outpost on the shores of Lake Athabaska, where he learned everything he could from the older fur trappers about the cold and hostile wilderness of the Northwest Territories.</p>
<p>On 3rd June 1789, he set out on his first journey of exploration. He was then 34 years old. With him he took a team of five trappers in one large birchbark canoe with sails, and in another five Indians, including one who acted as a guide and as an interpreter. Driving his party hard, Mackenzie travelled 58 kilometres (36 miles) on the first day and 130 km (81 miles) on the second. Soon they reached the Great Slave Lake which, even at this time of year, was covered with broken ice. The canoes were in constant danger of being crushed. Not only this, but the party were tormented by plagues of mosquitoes. They sailed towards the west looking for an exit from the lake. Eventually, they found a river, which now bears Mackenzie's name. The current was strong and, with a good wind behind them, they raised the sails on their canoes and travelled 480 kilometres (300 miles) along the river towards the west. Then, suddenly, they saw the Rocky Mountains in front of them, and the river went north.</p>
<p>Still optimistic of reaching the Pacific, Mackenzie continued to follow the river, in spite of being told by the Indians they met along its banks that it would probably take a lifetime to reach its source.</p>
<p>He soon realised, when he took his bearings, that he had come so far north that they were only one degree from the Arctic Circle. The river they were following would not end in the Pacific but in the Arctic Ocean. Nevertheless, he urged the party on and in time reached the northern ocean.</p>
<p>Winter was now approaching so it was essential to turn back to avoid it. Mackenzie and his men reached home three months after the start of their journey. They had covered 4&#160;800 km (3&#160;000 miles) but they had not reached the Pacific.</p>
<p>Realising that he was not as well prepared as he should be, either materially or psychologically, Mackenzie returned to Britain to get ready for his next journey. At home he began to assemble a collection of instruments and equipment. He also increased his knowledge of geography and of the techniques of surveying. Feeling better equipped and more confident, he returned to his fur trader's post ready for another attempt to find the Northwest Passage.</p>
