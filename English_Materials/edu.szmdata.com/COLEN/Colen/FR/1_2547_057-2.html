<p class="storyTitle">17. Six Pence per Second</p>
<p>Sarah and Brian have travelled by air from London to Sydney, Australia. Sarah has promised her mother that she will ring her to let her know that they have arrived safely. This is something she has done ever since she was a child. Brian thinks it is a silly idea to ring so far, to spend so much, and to say so little.</p>
<p>"If there were an accident," he says, "they'd know soon enough. Bad news travels fast."</p>
<p>But Sarah has promised that she would ring. "Besides," she says, "it doesn't cost much when you consider that it's the other side of the world. It's only six pence per second."</p>
<p>"If you're on that telephone for less than one minute, I'll eat my hat." Brian says, "And one minute's nearly four pounds."</p>
<p>"That's no more than you'd pay for a new hat," Sarah replies.</p>
<p>She has asked the man at the hotel desk to get her the number. The telephone rings. Sarah picks it up.</p>
<p>"Hello, Mum. Is that you?" she says.</p>
<p>"Six pence per second," Brian reminds her.</p>
<p>"Hello, love." It is Mrs. Lee, Sarah's mother, speaking from London. "My word, you do sound clear. You could be in the next room. It's a better line than when you used to call me from the University. Do you remember? I used to shout and still you couldn't hear me sometimes. And just think, you're on the other side of the world."</p>
<p>"Yes, Mum," Sarah puts in, "I just wanted to ring to&#160;...&#160;"</p>
<p>"I remember how you used to ring when you went to Betty's house to tea, when you were a little girl. And then when you used to go to camp with the Guides&#160;...&#160;" Mrs. Lee is a great talker.</p>
<p>"Nearly four pounds," says Brian.</p>
<p>Sarah manages to tell her mother that it is time to say goodbye.</p>
<p>"Yes, all right." says Mrs. Lee. "But you will write, won't you, like you used to do when you were at University&#160;...&#160;"</p>
<p>Once again, Mrs. Lee speaks fondly of the past, and there is no stopping her.</p>
<p>"Four pounds fifty," says Brian.</p>
<p>Finally, Sarah cuts her mother short, promises to write, and rings off.</p>
<p>"There! That wasn't long, was it?"</p>
<p>"Four pounds, ninety pence,"Brian replies. "And you didn't even say that we've arrived!"</p>
