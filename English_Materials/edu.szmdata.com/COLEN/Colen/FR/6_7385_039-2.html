<p class="storyTitle">19. The Soft Sell</p>
<p>One of the problems with today's economy is that it's very hard to find young people who are good salesmen. Many students coming out of college are more interested in a customer's motivation than they are in closing a sale. They also have a tendency to be too honest, which can play havoc in the retail business.</p>
<p>A friend of mine has a dress shop here in Georgetown, and she told me of the problems she had with a young lady a psychology major, whom she hired as a salesgirl.</p>
<p>This, in essence, is what happened:</p>
<p>The first day a lady came in the store, and the salesgirl (let us call her Miss Brampton) asked if she could be of help.</p>
<p>"I'd like a suit for the fall," the lady said.</p>
<p>"What price range?" Miss Brampton asked.</p>
<p>"It doesn't make any difference," the lady replied.</p>
<p>"Well, let me ask you this question: Do you want the suit because you need it? Or have you just had a fight with your husband and are trying to get even by making a very expensive purchase?"</p>
<p>"I beg your pardon?" the lady said.</p>
<p>"Perhaps you suspect him of some infidelity, and you think this is the only way you can get back at him."</p>
<p>"I have no idea what you're talking about," the customer said.</p>
<p>"Spending money in anger is a very expensive form of hostility. My advice to you is to think it over for a few days. Try to patch up your differences. Buying a new suit won't save your marriage."</p>
<p>"Thank you very much," the customer said frostily and left the store.</p>
<p>"She's angry with me now," Miss Brampton told the dress shop owner, "but in a week she'll be grateful I talked her out of it."</p>
<p>My friend the shop proprietor decided to let the incident pass; but that afternoon another customer came in, and Miss Brampton asked if she could be of help.</p>
<p>The lady said, "I need something really exciting. I'm going to the Kennedy Center, and I want a dress that will knock everyone dead."</p>
<p>Miss Brampton said, "We have some lovely evening dresses over here for insecure people."</p>
<p>"Insecure people?"</p>
<p>"Oh, yes. Didn't you know that clothes are one of the main ways women compensate for insecurity?' '</p>
<p>"I'm not insecure," the lady said angrily.</p>
<p>"Then why do you want to knock them dead at the Kennedy Center? Why can't you be accepted for yourself instead of what you wear? You are a very attractive person, and you have an inner beauty you try to disguise. I can sell you a new dress that will attract attention, but then you would never know if it were you or the dress that made people stop and stare."</p>
<p>By this time the dress shop owner decided to step in.</p>
<p>"Miss Brampton, if the lady wants an evening dress, let her see our evening dresses."</p>
<p>"No," the customer said. "Your girl is right. Why spend five hundred dollars to get a few compliments from people who really don't care what I wear? Thank you for helping me, young lady. It's true I've been insecure all these years and didn't even know it."</p>
<p>The customer walked out of the store.</p>
<p>The final straw for the dress store owner took place an hour later when a coed came in to buy a hotpant outfit, and Miss Brampton gave her thirty minutes on women's lib and then said, "All you do when you buy hotpants is become a sex object."</p>
<p>That night the dress shop owner put a sign in the window: HELP WANTED&#151;NO PSYCHOLOGY MAJORS NEED APPLY.</p>
