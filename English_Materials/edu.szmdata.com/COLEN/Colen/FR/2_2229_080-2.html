<p class="storyTitle">20. A Timeless Letter of Comfort</p>
<p>In October 1800 John Todd was born in Rutland, Vermont. Soon afterward his parents moved to Killingworth, Connecticut. When John was six, both his parents died. A kind-hearted aunt in North Killingworth agreed to take John and give him a home. He was brought up by her and lived in her home until he left to study for the ministry.</p>
<p>His aunt took seriously ill and feared she was about to die. In great distress she wrote John Todd a letter in which she asked him to tell her what death would be like.</p>
<p>Here is the letter he sent in reply:</p>
<p>It is now thirty-five years since I, as a little boy of six, was left quite alone in the world. You sent me word you would give me a home and be a kind mother to me. I have never forgotten the day when I made the long journey of ten miles to your house in North Killingworth. I can still recall my disappointment when, Instead of coming for me yourself, you sent your servant James to fetch me.</p>
<p>I well remember my tears and anxiety as, perched high on your horse and clinging tight to James, I rode off to my new home. Night fell before we finished the journey, and as it grew dark I became lonely and afraid. "Do you think she'll go to bed before we get there?" I asked James anxiously. "Oh, no," he said reassuringly. "She'll stay up for you. When we get out of these woods you'll see her candle shining in the window."</p>
<p>Presently we did ride out into the clearing, and there, sure enough, was your candle. I remember you were waiting at the door, that you put your arms close about me and that you lifted me&#151;a tired and bewildered little boy&#151;down from the horse. You had a fire burning on the hearth, a hot supper waiting on the stove. After supper you took me to my new room, heard me say my prayers, and then sat beside me until I fell asleep.</p>
<p>You probably realize why I am recalling all this to your memory. Some day soon God will send for you, to take you to a new home. Don't fear the summons, the strange journey, or the dark messenger of death who will fetch you. God can be trusted to do as much for you as you were kind enough to do for me so many years ago. At the end of the road you will find love and a welcome waiting, and you will be safe in God's care. I shall watch you and pray for you till you are out of sight, and then wait for the day when I shall make the same journey myself and find you waiting at the end of the road to greet me.</p>
