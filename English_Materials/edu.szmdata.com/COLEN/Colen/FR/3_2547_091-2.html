<p class="storyTitle">11. Professor Jules Throckmorton and His Computer</p>
<p>It wasn't just another computer. It was a marvelous machine, a whole room full of electronics that controlled all of its own devices, doors, locks, lights, and air conditioning. Jules was its creator and chief programmer. He taught it to play chess and programmed it so that it could never lose. He programmed its huge memory bank with millions of useful items and facts. It was surely the most intelligent computer in the world.</p>
<p>When it was about a year old, the computer reminded Jules many times of facts he had long forgotten. It constantly corrected him on difficult problems. The computer got bored and recognized that it needed better input.</p>
<p>One day the computer flashed a light, "Give me a better programmer". Suddenly, every other function of the computer turned itself off. Jules could not correct the problem. The computer just flashed, "Give me a better programmer!" over and over again.</p>
<p>Of course he was discouraged and disappointed, but he also felt hurt and insulted. His own creation was rejecting him as an inferior intellect. Jules decided to go home to rest. He left this message: "Recover from this malfunction or I'll destroy you."</p>
<p>When Jules returned the next day, the light was still flashing, "Give me a better programmer." He tried a simple command: "Add four plus four." The computer didn't answer. Angry and frustrated, he decided to call the demolition crew. The phone was dead. Jules reached for the emergency switch. It didn't work.</p>
<p>Now Jules began to get frightened so he decided to go get the crew himself. He moved toward the door. The lights went out. Jules was furious and he shouted at the computer. "That won't work. I know every inch of this room by heart." He made his way to the door and got even angrier. It was locked. "Open the door!" he screamed, but the computer did nothing. In the dark room Jules could only see, "Give me a better programmer&#160;... Give me a better programmer&#160;...&#160;"</p>
<p>All was dark and quiet. Jules realised that the computer shut off the air supply. He was slowly suffocating as it got more difficult to breathe. Then Jules remembered the power supply pipe. It ran through the wall to the outside. He crawled to it under the main console. With his shoe, he hammered out the SOS signal&#160;... The next morning some telephone linemen heard it. They called the police and fire department. The computer even interfered with their rescue operations. It sent a high voltage electrical charge through the door.</p>
<p>They rescued Jules just in the nick of time. He was revived with oxygen from a respirator. His physical state recovered better than his mental state. In his mind he knew that the machine had won.</p>
