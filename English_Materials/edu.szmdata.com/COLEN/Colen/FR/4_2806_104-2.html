<p class="storyTitle">4. Just the Job!</p>
<p>Rodney Mace, 35, is married with two young children, and is a part-time teacher of architectural history. "I am constantly surprised by other people's surprise, when they come to the house and see me cleaning a floor or hanging out the washing. Their eyes open wide at the sight of it! Much of the comment comes from men, but I am even more surprised at the number of women who comment too."</p>
<p>His wife Jane, an Oxford graduate in modern languages, has a demanding full-time job. She is director of the Cambridge House literacy scheme for adults in South London. Her working week involves several evenings and Saturdays, and at these times her husband is in sole charge of home and family. Apart from this, they share household jobs and employ a child-minder for the afternoons. This enables him to teach two days a week and to do what he considers his principal work: writing. He has written several books and spends much of his time in the British Museum Reading Room, cycling there from his home in Brixton.</p>
<p>People ask the Maces if they think that their children miss them. One can argue that satisfied parents generally have satisfied children, but in any case the Maces are careful to reserve time and energy to play with their children. "And they have now developed relationships with other adults and children."</p>
<p>Previously, Rodney Mace worked full-time and Jane only part-time. Then 18 months ago, the director of the literacy scheme left. "It seemed to me that Jane was very well suited to do this job. She was very doubtful about it. But I urged her to apply. She did, and she got it." Jane Mace confirms that she needed this encouragement, as so many women initially do.</p>
<p>Did his male ego suffer from the change-over? Nothing like that occurred. But he still seems amazed at the way it changed his thinking: "I felt that we were finally going to be partners. I felt enormous relief. I wasn't avoiding responsibility, but changing it. Our relationship is so much better now. It has been a change for the good for both of us&#151;I think for all of us, in every aspect of our lives. I cannot overemphasize that: in every aspect. I think it is fundamental that the woman works. The idea of equal partnership is an illusion if one partner doesn't work."</p>
