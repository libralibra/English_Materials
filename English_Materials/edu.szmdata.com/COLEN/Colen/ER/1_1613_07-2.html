<p class="storyTitle">7. Travelling Light</p>
<p class="radiusBorder">Have you ever gone travelling? What problems did you have when you did so? Perhaps, you can get some useful hints by reading the following article. <span class="styleNormal">Travelling Light</span> helps you to enjoy yourself.</p>
<p>Getting away for a short time always seems like a great idea&#151;until you have to pack. But packing won't be a problem if you keep in mind one simple rule. Whether you'll be sleeping overnight at a friend's house, or visiting a relative for a week, the rule is: <i>pack light</i>. Here are some tips to help you pack.</p>
<p>Make a list. Think of what you need from your head to your toes. Keep the list for future reference. When you've done this once, it will be easier the next time.</p>
<p>Consider buying small-size samples of shampoo, toothpaste, and other items at your local drugstore. You can reuse the plastic containers the next time you go away, too. Make sure they are all sealed tightly, and keep them in a plastic case or bag, in case they leak.</p>
<p>It's best to be prepared and bring these items with you, but in an emergency, you can get them at your destination. This is excellent for light travelling (you'd be surprised at how much those little things can weigh you down)&#151;but remember that the time you spend buying things at your destination will reduce your visiting time.</p>
<p>Choosing which clothes to bring is probably the hardest packing decision to make. Think once again from head to toe&#151;hat, shirts, jeans, sneakers, etc. Once you've picked out what you wanted to bring with you, think carefully&#151;do you really need that extra pair of jeans? If so, fine, but make sure they really are worth the extra weight. Don't try to fool yourself. You are the one who will be left holding the bag. Remember, three shirts and two pairs of pants are in fact six different dresses. Mixing and matching is a smart and easy way to lighten your load.</p>
<p>Weather is an important factor in your packing. If it is cold, you could wear a jacket, a sweater, a regular shirt, and a tee shirt. Layering up will keep you warm, and it will leave more room in your bag.</p>
<p>After you have mixed, matched, and layered, try to cut the amount of clothing you've chosen in half. It may seem impossible, but keep in mind how much easier it will be to carry your bag. After all, you are just visiting, not moving in for good. You probably won't miss the extra sweater too much for a few days, and it certainly won't miss you!</p>
<p>As for shoes, you may want to call ahead to see if dress shoes are necessary. If they are, one pair will be enough, along with one pair of comfortable shoes (sneakers for nice weather, heavier shoes or boots for the winter).</p>
<p>How to pack?</p>
<p>Use a small, light bag. Someone in your family may already have one that you can borrow. If you need to buy a bag, remember to find a simple one, like a canvas shoulder bag or a small backpack.</p>
<p>Be sure to put your things in your bag evenly. It makes carrying around a bag a lot easier.</p>
<p>Roll up your casual clothes instead of folding and laying them flat. This leaves more room to pack other things, and keeps your clothes fairly wrinkle-free.</p>
<p>Pack any breakables in the middle of your bag. Cushion them with your clothing.</p>
<p>Put name tags with your home address on&#151;and in&#151;your bag. Write in waterproof ink.</p>
<p>Remember that it is you who have been invited somewhere, not your things. You will have an easier time if you're not weighed down, so do it right&#151;pack light.</p>
