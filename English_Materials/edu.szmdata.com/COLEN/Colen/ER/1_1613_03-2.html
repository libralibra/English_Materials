			Ladies and gentlemen, my friends and I are about to present you with a puzzling problem. We would like each of you to try to solve it, so please pay careful attention for the next few minutes.
			<p>The problem appears in a short play we are going to perform. The scene is a hotel room. Miss Muffett has been staying there for two days. At the moment she is alone, but she will soon be visited by three different people. Please look closely at these characters, for one of them is acting very suspiciously.</p>

			And indeed, Miss Muffett was right, for later that day it was discovered that several rooms in the hotel had been burgled. If you were watching and listening to the play carefully, you may have noticed something rather suspicious about one of the characters. If you were a detective, which of them would you want to question, and why?
