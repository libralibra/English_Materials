<p class="storyTitle">22. First Teacher in Outer Space</p>
<p class="radiusBorder">On January 22, 1986, Sharon Christa McAuliffe, 36, became the first citizen passenger aboard a space shuttle. Before the shuttle was launched, Martha Pichey, a journalist, interviewed the high school social studies teacher at her home.</p>
<table border="0" style="font-size: 100%">
	<tr><td class="roles">MP:</td><td>What has been the most exciting thing to happen to you since you were chosen?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">SCM:</td><td>
		<p class="z">One of the nicest things is the letters and cards that have come from my students. I've enjoyed reading them, but I wish I had a little bit more time to write them each a note&#151;which I'll do. But it's going to take me a while. I've also been through a whole training process. Everything was a lot of fun. But there was always that edge because we were waiting to find out who was going to be chosen. And then, when I finally was picked, everything went so quickly. I haven't really been able to stand back and reflect upon what's happening.</p>
	<p>I can remember as I grew up realizing how quickly the space program was advancing&#151;to the point where we had these little satellites in orbit. Technology is changing so fast. So, when President Reagan first announced the teacher in space program, I thought it would be a great opportunity.</p>
	<p>As an educator, I think everybody realizes that the more experience you have, the better a "hands-on" person you are in the classroom. You have more to share with the students. So, looking at it from that perspective and seeing it as a once-in-a-lifetime chance, I felt that it would be foolish not to fill out the application. When I was selected on the state level, I was so excited just to be able to go to Washington, D.C.</p>
	</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">MP:</td><td>That was an important part of it, the sharing?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">SCM:</td><td>Oh, it was wonderful.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">MP:</td><td>I imagine that people look upon you as a pioneer and I wonder what your thoughts are on that&#151;especially with the research you've done on women pioneers in the 1800's.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">SCM:</td><td>I suppose when I think of pioneers, I mean pioneers in a new sense. I'm going to go up and then I'm coming down. I want to give my students and the world the perspective of an ordinary person. Astronauts don't have the opportunity to reflect a lot because their every minute is booked&#151;they are extremely busy when they're up there. I will have more time to sit and reflect and watch what's going on and maybe be able to put some thoughts down so that when I bring them back, students will feel a little bit of ownership with the space program. Because, hey, if a teacher can do it&#151;everybody has a teacher, everybody can relate to a teacher, teachers are approachable&#151;then it's everybody's program. Until now, the space program has been for only a few people.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">MP:</td><td>How long will your flight be?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">SCM:</td><td>Six days in space.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">MP:</td><td>How detailed will your diary be?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">SCM:</td><td>I don't know how it's going to be. I understand that weightlessness is probably not the easiest medium to write in. I might be trying to chase my paper around the compartment. I know that they have special space pens that are force-fed ink so that you can write.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">MP:</td><td>Will you have a specific job on the shuttle?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">SCM:</td><td>I'm sure they're going to use me. I figure that I have an extra pair of hands. I'll probably be taking a lot of pictures when the others don't have time to do that. I know a lot of my training is on the camera equipment. They're not going to give me the controls and I figure they are not going to let me launch the satellite. So anything I can help out with.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">MP:</td><td>Do you think being a woman will make the experience any different for you than it would for a man?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">SCM:</td><td>I don't think so. I was delighted when a woman was chosen, not just because it was me, but to think that there is going to be a woman representing the teaching profession. Kids are going to relate to that teacher&#151;whether it's a man or a woman.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">MP:</td><td>How do you know so much about the space program?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">SCM:</td><td>I follow the space program and I'm learning a lot about it through workshops in Washington, D.C.. People are not going to have time to teach me while I'm up there. I have to know how to fix my own coffee in the morning, where everything is stored, what I'm supposed to be doing. I'll also be teaching a few lessons on board the shuttle and any school with a satellite dish can pick it up. I'll teach a science lesson, a humanities lesson, and one that hasn't been developed yet.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">MP:</td><td>If there's one thing you could tell young people about your experience so far, what would it be?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">SCM:</td><td>When I filled out the application, I had no thought that I was ever going to get this far. I hope that message comes across to students. I always encourage my students to go beyond their set limitations. You just don't know what's going to be around the next corner. And maybe, if you take that chance, other opportunities may come.</td></tr>
