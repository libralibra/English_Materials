<p class="storyTitle">16. A Good Night's Sleep</p>
<p class="radiusBorder">Have you ever had the experience that your bus or train is late when you are anxious to get somewhere? What is the best way to solve the problem when you are delayed? The following story will probably give you some useful hints.</p>
<p>Nobody likes to travel as much as I do. On business or for pleasure, on foot or by boat, I am ready to go anywhere, anytime. But recently I was sitting in a railroad station and cursing the day that I left home.</p>
<p>The reason was simple. I had just found out that my train would be three hours late. I love traveling&#151;but I <i>hate</i> waiting!</p>
<p>Suddenly I had an idea. Why don't I take a bus instead? I was about to rush out of the train station when a well-dressed old man took me by the arm.</p>
<p>"Young lady," said the gentleman, "shouldn't you find out the bus schedule before you rush to catch that bus?"</p>
<p>I stared at him with my mouth open. How did he read my mind? Before I could say a word, he smiled and added: "You are wondering how I knew about your plan? You see, my train is also running late. The same idea came to me. But I have learned the hard way that it doesn't pay to be too clever when you are traveling. Shall I tell you how I learned my lesson? Good conversation helps pass the time. Before you know it, your train will be there."</p>
<p>Well, the truth is I love listening to a good story. How could I refuse? I sat down again and the man began:</p>
<p>As you can see, I have many cameras with me. That's because I'm a professional photographer. I have done well. I can choose when and where to go. But when I was young, things were different. I had to take every job that was offered to me.</p>
<p>One of my first big jobs was to photograph the Winter Olympics in Austria. For eight days I worked day and night. To save money, I took a hotel room with two other photographers. It was cheap. We also liked each other. We had a wonderful time together. There was only one problem: we never got any sleep. When the job was over, I had only one desire: a good night's sleep. After my two friends left, I kept the hotel room for one more night. Early that afternoon I went to the room, took off my clothes, and went to bed. I closed my eyes and right away I&#160;...&#160;</p>
<p>Fell asleep? I wish I could say that. Just then I heard a noise at the door.</p>
<p>"Telegram!" a man cried out. I got up and opened the door. A clerk handed me the telegram. It read: "Take first plane to Paris. Call magazine when you arrive." It was signed by the editor of the largest magazine in France. I had no choice. I needed sleep badly, but this was more important. I had to go to Paris right away.</p>
<p>I rushed to the caf&#233; downstairs. I drank several cups of coffee to keep me awake. Then I crossed the street to the travel agent's office. The next plane to Paris was leaving at seven that evening. I looked at the clock: it was already 5:50. I bought a one-way ticket and hurried back to my room.</p>
<p>I quickly packed my suitcases and paid my bill. In half an hour I was sitting in a taxi. A light snow was falling. The taxi driver said that he hoped the snow wouldn't get worse. If it does, he said, they might have to close the airport for the night. He said he wouldn't want that to happen to me.</p>
<p>Close the airport for the night? The idea seemed too good to be true. I could get a good night's sleep and leave for Paris in the morning. I could still take the first flight to Paris. And I would be well-rested when I got there!</p>
<p>During the ride I began to form a beautiful picture of the night ahead. The airline would give me a free hotel room. I would have my own bathroom. I would order dinner in my room. Then I would take a hot bath. After that I would send a telegram to Paris to explain why I was late. Finally, I would go to sleep at last.</p>
<p>"What happened?" I asked, when the man stopped for a moment. "Did they close the airport for the night? Did you get your own room?"</p>
<p>The man looked at me and smiled. Then he went on:</p>
<p>I told you before, I was young then and a little too clever. Oh, they closed the airport all right. And the airline did offer us free rooms&#151;but not our own. Passengers traveling alone were told that they had to share a room with another passenger.</p>
<p>When I heard that I got angry. I decided that one way or another I would get my own room. When we got to the hotel, everyone stood in line at the desk. When my turn came, the clerk said, "Are you traveling alone, sir?"</p>
<p>I didn't answer. Instead, I covered my eyes.</p>
<p>"Are you feeling sick?" he asked, without real interest.</p>
<p>"Sir," I answered, "I have a serious and unusual disease. If I fall asleep I may stop breathing. I am on my way to see an important doctor in Paris. Until then I must not fall asleep. I must have the lights on in my room all night long." (Not a bad story, don't you think? My grandfather had this disease once. It's known as <i>Ondine's Curse</i>.)</p>
<p>I watched the clerk carefully. Would he believe my story? I was afraid that he wouldn't. But I was wrong. He picked up a key and said, "We have very few rooms, but it is clear that you must have a private room. Here's the key to Room 20."</p>
<p>I can't tell you how happy I was. I wanted to throw my arms around the poor fool. But before I could take the key, a little man walked to the head of the line. He was wearing sunglasses and walked with a metal walking cane.</p>
<p>The man turned to the clerk and said, "I will be happy to share a room with this gentleman. It won't bother me if he keeps the lights on all night. As you see, I am blind."</p>
<p>I couldn't believe my ears! The clerk quickly gave us the keys to another room. He looked very pleased. So did the blind man. The only person who wasn't pleased was, well, you know who. I took my suitcases and the blind man's and together we went up to our room.</p>
<p>"Well, you didn't have your own room," I said, "but you probably got a good night's sleep."</p>
<p>"No," the old man answered, looking very sad.</p>
<p>"But the other passenger was blind. Didn't you turn off the lights?"</p>
<p>The old man smiled. "When we got to the room, the blind man turned to me and said, 'I am very sorry that you have a bad disease. But I also must tell you that I am a little pleased. I have a serious problem falling asleep. I don't think I will be able to sleep tonight at all. I have insomnia. The reason I wanted to share a room with you is that I wanted someone to talk to. Since you can't fall asleep and I can't fall asleep, we can pass the time together! The troubles of many are half a comfort, as they say.'</p>
<p>"He smiled at me so sadly that I knew that I could never tell him the truth. He needed me. He thought I needed him. I thanked him and&#160;... well, stayed up all night. Oh, I think that's your train now, young lady."</p>
<p>I looked up. Everyone was running to catch the train. I thanked the gentleman for telling me such an amusing story and rushed to get on the train. As the train started off, I looked up to say goodbye again to my new friend. And what do you think he was doing? Taking a picture of me, of course.</p>
