<p class="storyTitle">25. The Leopold Locked Room (1)</p>
<p class="radiusBorder">People were celebrating a wedding ceremony when a sudden gunshot echoed through the hall. The shocked guests pushed the door open. Leopold, a senior detective, was found holding a gun in his hand, and his ex-wife Monica, stained with blood, was lying on the ground. Who shot Monica?</p>
<p>Captain Leopold had never spoken to anyone about his divorce, and it was a distinct surprise to Lieutenant Fletcher when he suddenly said, "Did I ever tell you about my wife, Fletcher?"</p>
<p>They were just coming up from the police pistol range in the basement of headquarters after their monthly target practice, and it hardly seemed a likely time to be discussing past marital trouble. Fletcher glanced at him sideways and answered, "No, I guess you never did, Captain."</p>
<p>They had reached the top of the stairs and Leopold turned in to the little room where the coffee, sandwich, and soft-drink machines were kept. It was a place where off-duty cops could sit and chat, which was what Leopold and Fletcher were doing now.</p>
<p>Fletcher bought the coffee and put the steaming paper cups on the table between them. "She's coming back," Leopold said simply, and it took Fletcher an instant to grasp the meaning of his words.</p>
<p>"Your wife is coming back?"</p>
<p>"My ex-wife."</p>
<p>"Here? What for?"</p>
<p>Leopold sighed and played with the little bag of sugar that Fletcher had given him with his coffee. "Her niece is getting married. Our niece."</p>
<p>"I never knew you had one."</p>
<p>"She's been away at college. Her name is Vicki Nelson, and she's marrying a young lawyer named Moore. And Monica is coming back east for the wedding."</p>
<p>"I never even knew her name," Fletcher observed, taking a sip of his coffee. "Haven't you seen her since the divorce?"</p>
<p>Leopold shook his head. "Not for fifteen years. She wanted to be a movie star, I was just starting on the police force then, and the future looked pretty bright for me here. Well, pretty soon it got to be an obsession with her, really bad. She'd spend her afternoons in movie theaters and her evenings watching old films on television. Finally, when I still refused to go west with her, she just left me."</p>
<p>"Just walked out?"</p>
<p>Leopold nodded. "It was a blessing, really, that we didn't have children. I heard she got a few minor jobs out there&#151;as an extra, and some technical stuff behind the scenes. Then apparently she had a nervous breakdown. About a year later I received the official word that she'd divorced me. I heard that she recovered and was back working, and I think she had another marriage that didn't work out."</p>
<p>"Why would she come back for the wedding?"</p>
<p>"Vicki is her niece and also her godchild. We were just married when Vicki was born, and I suppose Monica might consider her the child we never had. In any event, I know she still hates me and blames me for everything that's gone wrong with her life. She told a friend once a few years ago she wished I were dead."</p>
<p>"Do you have to go to this wedding, too, Captain?"</p>
<p>Leopold smiled ruefully. "I want a favor from you."</p>
<p>"Anything, Captain. You know that."</p>
<p>"I'd like you to come out there with me. I'll tell them I'm working and that I can only stay for a few minutes. You can wait outside in the car if you want. At least they'll see you there and believe my excuse."</p>
<p>Fletcher could see the importance of it to Leopold, and the effort that had gone into the asking. "Sure," he said. "Be glad to. When is it?"</p>
<p>"This Saturday. The reception's in the afternoon, at Sunset Farms."</p>
<p>Sunset Farms was a low rambling place at the end of a paved driveway, overlooking a wooded valley and a gently flowing creek. If it had ever been a farm, that day was long past; but for wedding receptions and retirement parties it was the ideal place. The interior of the main building was, in reality, one huge square room, divided by accordion doors to make up to four smaller square rooms.</p>
<p>When Leopold entered the place at five minutes of two on Saturday afternoon, the hired combo was just beginning to play music for dancing.</p>
<p>He watched for a moment while Vicki stood, radiant, and allowed her new husband to escort her to the center of the floor. Ted Moore was a bit older than Leopold had expected, but as the pair glided slowly across the floor, he could find no visible fault with the match. He helped himself to a glass of champagne punch and stood ready to intercept them as they left the dance floor.</p>
<p>"It's Captain Leopold, isn't it?" someone asked. A face from his past loomed up, a tired man with a gold tooth in the front of his smile. "I'm Immy Fontaine, Monica's stepbrother."</p>
<p>"Sure," Leopold said, as if he'd remembered the man all along. Monica had rarely mentioned Immy, and Leopold recalled meeting him once or twice at family gatherings. But the sight of him now, gold tooth and all, reminded Leopold that Monica was somewhere nearby, that he might confront her at any moment.</p>
<p>"We're so glad you could come," someone else said, and he turned to greet the bride and groom as they came off the dance floor. Up close, Vicki was a truly beautiful girl, clinging to her new husband's arm like a proper bride.</p>
<p>"This is Ted," she said.</p>
<p>Leopold shook his hand, silently approving the firm grip and friendly eyes.</p>
<p>"I understand you're a lawyer," Leopold said.</p>
<p>"That's right, sir. Mostly civil cases, though. I don't tangle much with criminals."</p>
<p>They chatted for a few more seconds before the pressure of guests broke them apart. The luncheon was about to be served, and the more hungry ones were already lining up at the buffet tables. Vicki and Ted went over to start the line, and Leopold took another glass of champagne punch.</p>
<p>"I see the car waiting outside," Immy Fontaine said, moving in again, "You got to go on duty?"</p>
<p>Leopold nodded. "Just this glass and I have to leave."</p>
<p>"Monica's in from the West Coast."</p>
<p>"So I heard."</p>
<p>A slim man with a mustache jostled against him in the crush of the crowd and hastily apologized. Fontaine seized the man by the arm and introduced him to Leopold. "This here's Dr. Felix Thursby. He came east with Monica. Doc, I want you to meet Captain Leopold, her ex-husband."</p>
<p>Leopold shook hands awkwardly, embarrassed for the man and for himself. "A fine wedding," he mumbled. "Your first trip east?"</p>
<p>Thursby shook his head. "I'm from New York. Long ago."</p>
<p>"I was on the police force there once," Leopold remarked.</p>
<p>They chatted for a few more minutes before Leopold managed to edge away through the crowd.</p>
<p>"Leaving so soon?" a harsh unforgettable voice asked.</p>
<p>He stared down at the handsome, middle-aged woman who now blocked his path to the door. She had gained a little weight, especially in the bosom, and her hair was graying. Only the eyes startled him, and frightened him just a bit. They had the intense wild look he'd seen before on the faces of deranged criminals.</p>
<p>The music had started again, and the line from the buffet tables was beginning to snake lazily about the room. But for Leopold and Monica they might have been alone in the middle of a desert.</p>
<p>"Come in here," she said, "where we can talk." She motioned toward the end of the room which was cut off by accordion doors. Leopold followed her, helpless to do anything else. She unlocked the doors and pulled them apart, just wide enough for them to enter the unused quarter of the large room. Then she closed and locked the doors behind them, and stood facing him. They were two people, alone in a bare unfurnished room.</p>
<p>They were in an area about thirty feet square, with the windows at the far end and the locked accordion doors at Leopold's back. He could see the afternoon sun cutting through the trees outside, and the gentle hum of the air-conditioner came through above the subdued murmur of the wedding guests.</p>
<p>"Remember the day we got married?" she asked.</p>
<p>"Yes. Of course."</p>
<p>She walked to the middle window, running her fingers along the frame, perhaps looking for the latch to open it. But it stayed closed as she faced him again. "Our marriage was as drab and barren as this room. Lifeless, unused!"</p>
<p>"You walked out on me, Monica. Remember?" he reminded her softly.</p>
<p>"Sure I did! Because I had a career waiting for me! I had all the world waiting for me! And you know what happened because you wouldn't come along? You know what happened to me out there? They took my money and my self-respect and what virtue I had left. They made me into a tramp, and when they were done they locked me up in a mental hospital for three years. Three years!"</p>
<p>"I'm sorry."</p>
<p>"You're a big detective now. Sometimes your cases even get reported in the California papers." She was pacing back and forth, caged, dangerous. "Big detective. But I can still destroy you just as you destroyed me!"</p>
<p>He glanced over his shoulder at the locked accordion doors, seeking a way out.</p>
<p>"You should see a doctor, Monica."</p>
<p>Her eyes closed to mere slits. "I've seen doctors." Now she paused before the middle window, facing him. "I came all the way east for this day, because I thought you'd be here."</p>
<p>"What in hell are you talking about?"</p>
<p>Her mouth twisted in a horrible grin. "You're going to know what I knew. Bars and cells and disgrace."</p>
<p>"Monica&#151;"</p>
<p>At that instant perhaps twenty feet separated them. She lifted one arm, as if to shield herself, then screamed in terror. "No! Oh, God, no!"</p>
<p>A sudden gunshot echoed through the room. He saw the bullet strike her in the chest, toppling her backward like the blow from a giant fist. Then somehow he had his own gun out of its belt holster and he swung around toward the doors.</p>
<p>They were still closed and locked. He was alone in the room with Monica.</p>
<p>He looked back to see her crumple on the floor, blood spreading in a widening circle around the torn black hole in her dress. His eyes went to the windows, but all three were still closed and unbroken. He shook his head, trying to focus his mind on what had happened.</p>
<p>Someone opened the lock from the other side, and the gap between the doors widened as they were pulled open. "What happened?" someone asked. A woman guest screamed as she saw the body. Another toppled in a faint.</p>
<p>Leopold stepped back, aware of the gun still in his hand, and saw Lieutenant Fletcher fighting his way through the mob of guests. "Captain, what is it?"</p>
<p>"She&#151;Someone shot her."</p>
<p>Fletcher reached out and took the gun from Leopold's hand&#151;carefully, as one might take a broken toy from a child. He put it to his nose and sniffed, then opened the cylinder to inspect the bullets. "It's been fired recently, Captain. One shot." Then his eyes seemed to cloud over, almost to the point of tears.</p>
