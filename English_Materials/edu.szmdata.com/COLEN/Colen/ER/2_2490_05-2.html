<p class="storyTitle">5. Better Known as Mark Twain</p>
<p class="radiusBorder">Mark Twain is a well-known American writer. Do you know how he became such a remarkable writer? In his later years, he decided to wear nothing but white from head to foot. Can you guess why?</p>
<p>This remarkable man went to a log-cabin school until he was twelve years old. That was the end of his formal education. In spite of this, he became the most famous literary figure of his generation. He received honorary degrees from Oxford University and Yale University. People speak of him as the best known humorous writer of all times. He also brought realism and western local color to American fiction. He made millions of dollars by writing articles, short stories, and books. His real name was Samuel Langhorne Clemens, but he is better known all over the world as Mark Twain.</p>
<p>Mark Twain was born in a small Missouri village near the Mississippi River in 1835. At that time, Andrew Jackson was the president of the country. Abraham Lincoln was still a young farm laborer in Illinois. The first railroad had been built seven years before. The Industrial Revolution was at hand. The economic collapse of American prosperity, called the Panic of 1837, still lay ahead. This was also the literary period later called the "New England Renaissance".</p>
<p>Mark Twain was not a healthy baby. In fact, he was not expected to live through the first winter. But with his mother's tender care, he managed to survive. He had been born in a tiny two-room cabin. Eight people lived together there. He had four brothers and sisters. A slave girl lived with them too.</p>
<p>As a boy, Mark Twain caused much trouble for his parents. He used to play practical jokes on all his friends and neighbors. The nature of his jokes often led to violence. He hated to go to school, and he constantly ran away from home. He always went in the direction of the nearby Mississippi. He was fascinated by that mighty river. He liked to sit on the bank of the river for hours at a time and just gaze at the mysterious islands and passing boats and rafts. He was nearly drowned nine different times. He learned many things about the river during those days. He learned all about its history and the unusual people who rode up and down it. He never forgot those scenes and those people. He later made them part of the history of America in his books <i>Tom Sawyer</i> and <i>Huckleberry Finn</i>.</p>
<p>Mark Twain inherited his genius for humor from his mother. Obviously, he did not inherit it from his father. He once stated that he had never seen a smile on his father's face. On the other hand, his mother had the rare ability to say humorous things with perfect innocence. This same ability made Mark Twain an extremely humorous public speaker.</p>
<p>After his father's death in 1847, Mark Twain left school and became a printer's apprentice. His mother felt that he could make a living and get some education in this way. He worked for the printer as an apprentice for two years. During that time he received only his board and clothes as pay.</p>
<p>By 1853, Mark Twain was tired of Missouri. He got an urge to see the world and started out with empty pockets. He worked as a printer in St. Louis, New York, and Philadelphia. Then, as a result of reading a book, he decided to go to the upper part of the Amazon River. He planned to make a fortune by collecting and selling cocoa. His only problem was money for the trip. That problem was solved in an unusual way. He found a fifty-dollar bill on the sidewalk and left for Brazil the next day. He got as far as the Mississippi River and then ran out of money.</p>
<p>Next Mark Twain decided to become a river-boat pilot on the Mississippi. He followed his new profession for fifteen months. He memorized all the turns, shallow spots, and dangerous rocks in the 1200 miles from St. Louis to New Orleans. He learned about the pride and responsibilities of the pilots. He became an excellent pilot. However, his life as a pilot came to a sudden end. The river was closed to navigation at the outbreak of the Civil War. Then he joined the Confederate Army, but shortly after that, his company was disbanded. He did not join the army again.</p>
<p>He followed his brother Orion to Nevada in 1861 and consequently took up his next profession. He became a miner in this frontier region. During this period, he started to write short articles. The publisher of the Enterprise in Virginia City, Nevada, recognized Mark Twain's ability and offered him a job as an editor with a salary of $25 a week. He walked 125 miles over bad roads and rough country to accept the job. It was at this time that he adopted the pen name "Mark Twain".</p>
<p>Later Mark Twain worked in San Francisco for a while and then became a miner again. In his spare time, he wrote a short story called <i>The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County</i>. This story made him known all over the country, and he decided to become a full-time writer and lecturer. He went to New York in 1867 and published his first book that year. His next book, <i>Innocents Abroad</i>, was published in 1869. It was a report of his European tour as a Westerner saw it. It was a completely new kind of travel book. It gave him a national reputation.</p>
<p>In 1870, Mark Twain was married to Olivia Langdon in Elmira, New York. It was an extremely successful marriage. They were devoted to each other throughout their lives. His wife Olivia had a strong and lasting influence on his writing. She was always careful to remove all of the bad words. He always accepted her changes without argument. In the years following his marriage, he wrote the books for which he is most famous: <i>Tom Sawyer</i> in 1876, <i>Huckleberry Finn</i> in 1884, <i>A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court</i> in 1889.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Mark Twain had no business ability at all. He made vast profits from writing and lecturing, but time after time, he lost money in bad investments. He finally lost his entire fortune in the publishing business in 1895. He took the responsibility for all of his debts. He wrote large numbers of stories in order to pay those debts. He made a successful tour around the world. He was finally able to pay. Despite the tremendous effort this had required, he had been able to keep his health. His life had worse tragedies than the financial ones, however. His wife Olivia died in 1904. Three of his children had died previously.</p>
<p>At the age of seventy, his hair was completely white. He decided to buy fourteen white suits and a hundred white neckties. He wore nothing but white from head to foot until his death in Redding, Connecticut on April 21, 1910.</p>
