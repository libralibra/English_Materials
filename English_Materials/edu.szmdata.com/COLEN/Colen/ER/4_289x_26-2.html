<p class="storyTitle">26. The Leopold Locked Room (2)</p>
<p class="radiusBorder">All the evidence available seems to point to the conclusion that Leopold was the murderer. Yet, Leopold's friend Fletcher doesn't seem to think so. How can they prove his innocence?</p>
<p>Fletcher drove Leopold down to headquarters, to the commissioner's office, and Leopold sat there and waited, running his moist palms up and down his trousers. Monica died on the way to Southside Hospital.</p>
<p>The detectives who worked under Leopold came to and left the commissioner's office, speaking in low tones with their heads together, occasionally offering him some embarrassed gesture of condolence.</p>
<p>"You have nothing more to tell us, Captain?" the commissioner asked.</p>
<p>"I didn't kill her," Leopold insisted again. "It was someone else."</p>
<p>"Who? How?"</p>
<p>Leopold ran a hand over his forehead. "It couldn't have been my gun. Ballistics will prove that."</p>
<p>"But your gun had been fired recently, and there was an empty cartridge in the chamber."</p>
<p>"I can't explain that. I haven't fired it since the other day at target practice, and I reloaded it afterwards."</p>
<p>"Could she have hated you that much, Captain?" Fletcher asked. "To frame you for her murder?"</p>
<p>Leopold nodded. "Wait for the ballistics report," he said. "That'll clear me."</p>
<p>So they waited. It was another forty-five minutes before the phone rang and the commissioner spoke to the ballistics man. He listened, and grunted, and asked one or two questions. Then he hung up and faced Leopold across the desk.</p>
<p>"The bullet was fired from your gun," he said simply. "There's no possibility of error. I'm afraid we'll have to charge you with homicide."</p>
<p>The routines he knew so well went on into Saturday evening, and when they were finished Leopold was escorted from the courtroom to find young Ted Moore waiting for him. "You should be on your honeymoon," Leopold told him.</p>
<p>"Vicki couldn't leave till I'd seen you and tried to help. I don't know much about criminal law, but perhaps I could arrange bail."</p>
<p>"That's already been taken care of," Leopold said. "The grand jury will get the case next week."</p>
<p>"I&#151;I don't know what to say. Vicki and I are both terribly sorry."</p>
<p>"So am I." He started to walk away, then turned back. "Enjoy your honeymoon."</p>
<p>"We'll be in town overnight, at the Towers, if there's anything I can do."</p>
<p>Leopold nodded and kept on walking. He could see the reflection of his guilt in young Moore's eyes. As he got to his car, one of the patrolmen he knew glanced his way and then quickly in the other direction. On a Saturday night no one talked to wife murderers. Even Fletcher had disappeared.</p>
<p>Leopold decided he couldn't face the drab walls of his office. Besides, the commissioner had been forced to suspend him from active duty. He cursed silently and drove home to his little apartment, weaving through the dark streets with one eye out for a patrol car. He wondered if they'd be watching him, to prevent his jumping bail. He wondered what he'd have done in the commissioner's shoes.</p>
<p>The eleven-o'clock news on television had it as the lead item, illustrated with a black-and-white photo of him taken during a case last year. He shut off the television without listening to their comments and went back outside, walking down to the corner for an early edition of the Sunday paper. The front-page headline was as bad as he'd expected:</p>
<center>
<p class="faceMono">DETECTIVE CAPTAIN HELD IN SLAYING OF EX-WIFE.</p>
</center>
<p>On the way back to his apartment, walking slowly, he tried to remember what she'd been like before the divorce. But all he could remember were those mad vengeful eyes. And the bullet ripping into her chest.</p>
<p>Perhaps he had killed her after all. Perhaps the gun had come into his hand so easily he never realized it was there.</p>
<p>"Hello, Captain."</p>
<p>"I&#151;Fletcher! What are you doing here?"</p>
<p>"I've got a six-pack of beer. I thought you might want to talk about it."</p>
<p>Leopold unlocked his apartment door. "What's there to talk about?"</p>
<p>"If you say you didn't kill her, Captain, I'm willing to listen to you."</p>
<p>Fletcher followed him into the tiny kitchen and popped open two of the beer cans. Leopold accepted one of them and dropped into the nearest chair. He felt utterly exhausted, drained of even the strength to fight back.</p>
<p>"She framed me, Fletcher," he said quietly. "She framed me as neatly as anything I've ever seen. The thing's impossible, but she did it."</p>
<p>"Let's go over it step by step, Captain. Look, the way I see it there are only three possibilities: Either you shot her, she shot herself, or someone else shot her. I think we can rule out the last one. The three windows were locked on the outside and unbroken, the room was bare of any hiding place, and the only entrance was through the accordion doors. These were closed and locked, and although they could have been opened from the other side, you certainly would have seen or heard it happen. Besides, there were one hundred and fifty wedding guests on the other side of those doors. No one could have unlocked and opened them and then fired the shot, all without being seen."</p>
<p>Leopold shook his head. "But it's just as impossible that she could have shot herself. There was nothing in her hands, not even a purse. And the gun that shot her was in my holster, on my belt."</p>
<p>Fletcher finished his beer and reached for another can. "I didn't look at her close, Captain, but the size of the hole in her dress and the powder burns point to a contact wound. The medical examiner agrees, too. She was shot from no more than an inch or two away. There were grains of powder in the wound itself, though the bleeding had washed most of them away."</p>
<p>"But she had nothing in her hand," Leopold repeated. "And there was nobody standing in front of her with a gun. Even I was twenty feet away."</p>
<p>Fletcher stared at his beer. "How much time do we have?"</p>
<p>"If the grand jury indicts me for first-degree murder, I'll be in a cell by next week."</p>
<p>Fletcher sighed and stood up. "Then I guess there's really nothing I can do for you, Captain. Good night."</p>
<p>Leopold didn't see him to the door. He simply sat there, hunched over the table. For the first time in his life he felt like an old man.</p>
<p>Leopold slept late Sunday morning and awakened with the odd sensation that it had all been a dream. Rolling over in his narrow bed, he saw the Sunday paper where he'd tossed it the night before. The headline was still the same. The dream was a reality.</p>
<p>He got up and showered and dressed, reaching for his holster out of habit before he remembered he no longer had a gun. Then he sat at the kitchen table staring at the empty beer cans, wondering what he would do with his day. With his life.</p>
<p>The door bell rang and it was Fletcher. He was excited, and the words tumbled out of him almost before he was through the door. "I think I've got something, Captain! I got hold of the dress Monica was wearing when she was shot."</p>
<p>Fletcher unwrapped the package he'd brought. "The commissioner would have my neck if he knew I brought this to you, but look at this hole!"</p>
<p>Leopold studied the jagged, blood-caked rent in the fabric.</p>
<p>"Captain, I've seen plenty of entrance wounds made by a thirty-eight slug. I've even caused a few of them. But I never saw one that looked like this. Hell, it's not even round!"</p>
<p>"What are you trying to tell me, Fletcher?" Suddenly something stirred inside him. The juices were beginning to flow again.</p>
<p>"The hole in her dress is much larger and more ragged than the corresponding wound in her chest, Captain. That's what I'm telling you. The bullet that killed her couldn't have made this hole. No way! And that means maybe she wasn't killed when we thought she was."</p>
<p>Leopold grabbed the phone and dialed the familiar number of the Towers Hotel. It was a full minute before he heard Ted Moore's sleepy voice answering on the other end. "Ted, this is Leopold. Sorry to bother you."</p>
<p>The voice came alert at once. "That's all right, Captain. I told you to call if there was anything&#151;"</p>
<p>"I think there is. You and Vicki between you must have a good idea of who was invited to the wedding. Check with her and tell me how many doctors were on the invitation list."</p>
<p>Ted Moore was gone for a few moments and then he returned. "Vicki says you're the second person who asked her that."</p>
<p>"Oh? Who was the first?"</p>
<p>"Monica. The night before the wedding, when she arrived in town with Dr. Thursby. She casually asked if he'd get to meet any other doctors at the reception."</p>
<p>"Then after the shooting, it was Thursby who examined her? No one else?"</p>
<p>"He was the only doctor. He told us to call an ambulance and rode to the hospital with her."</p>
<p>"Thank you, Ted. You've been a big help."</p>
<p>"I hope so, Captain."</p>
<p>Leopold hung up and faced Fletcher. "That's it. She worked it with this guy Thursby. Can you put out an alarm for him?"</p>
<p>"Sure can," Fletcher said. He took the telephone and dialed the unlisted squad room number. Fletcher completed issuing orders and hung up the phone. "They'll check his hotel and call me back."</p>
<p>"Get the commissioner on the phone, too. Tell him what we've got."</p>
