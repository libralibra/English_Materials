<p class="storyTitle">13. The Date Father Didn't Keep</p>
<p class="radiusBorder">In the following story the writer's father broke an important date when he was young. How did it happen? Read the story and find the answer.</p>
<p>It happened in one of those colourful Danish inns which offer service specially for tourists and where English is spoken. I was with my father on a business-and-pleasure trip, and in our leisure hours we were having a wonderful time.</p>
<p>"I wish Mother were here," said I.</p>
<p>"If your mother had come with us," said Father, "it would have been wonderful to show her around."</p>
<p>He had visited Denmark when he was a young man. I asked him, "How long is it since you were here?"</p>
<p>"Oh, about thirty years. I remember being in this very inn, by the way." He looked around, remembering. "Those were pleasant and enjoyable days&#160;...&#160;" He stopped suddenly, and I saw that his face was pale. I followed his eyes and looked across the room to a woman who was setting a tray of drink before some customers. She might have been pretty once, but now she was stout and her hair was untidy. "Do you know her?" I asked.</p>
<p>"I did once," he said.</p>
<p>The woman came to our table. "Drinks?" she asked.</p>
<p>"We'll have beer," I said. She nodded and went away.</p>
<p>"How she has changed! Thank heaven she didn't recognize me," father said in a low voice, mopping his face with a handkerchief. "I knew her before I met your mother," he went on. "I was a student, on a tour. She was a lovely young thing, very graceful. I fell madly in love with her, and she with me."</p>
<p>"Does Mother know about her?" I said suddenly, without thinking.</p>
<p>"Of course," Father said gently. He looked at me a little anxiously. I felt embarrassed for him.</p>
<p>I said, "Dad, you don't have to&#160;...&#160;"</p>
<p>"Your mother would tell you if she were here. I don't want you wondering about this. I was a foreigner to her family. I was dependent on my father. If she had married me, she wouldn't have had any prospects. So her father objected to our romance. When I wrote to my father that I wanted to get married he cut off my allowance. And I had to go home. But I met the girl once more, and told her I would return to America, borrow enough money to get married on, and come back for her in a few months."</p>
<p>"We knew," he continued, "that her father might stop and seize our letter, so we agreed that I would simply mail her a slip of paper with a date on it, the time she was to meet me at a certain place; then we'd get married. Well, I went home, got the loan and sent her the date. She received the note. She wrote me: 'I'll be there.' But she wasn't. Then I found that she had been married about two weeks before, to a local innkeeper. She hadn't waited."</p>
<p>Then my father said, "Thank God she didn't. I went home, met your mother, and we've been completely happy. We often joke about that youthful love romance. I suggest that one day you write a story about it."</p>
<p>The woman appeared with our beer.</p>
<p>"You are from America?" she asked me.</p>
<p>"Yes," I said.</p>
<p>She smiled happily, "A wonderful country, America."</p>
<p>"Yes, a lot of your countrymen have gone there. Did you ever think of it?"</p>
<p>"Not me. Not now," she said. "I thought so one time, a long time ago. But I stayed here. It's much better here."</p>
<p>We drank our beer and left. Outside I said, "Father, just how did you write that date on which she was to meet you?"</p>
<p>He stopped, took out an envelope and wrote on it. "Like this," he said. "12/11/13, which was, of course, December 11, 1913."</p>
<p>"No!" I exclaimed. "It isn't in Denmark or any European country. Over here they write the day first, then the month. So that date wouldn't be December 11 but the 12th of November!"</p>
<p>Father passed his hand over his face. "So she was there!" he exclaimed, "and it was because I didn't show up that she got married." He was silent a while. "Well," he said, "I hope she's happy. She seems to be."</p>
<p>As we resumed walking I said, "It's a lucky thing it happened that way. You wouldn't have met Mother."</p>
<p>He put his arm around my shoulders, looked at me with a heartwarming smile, and said, "I was doubly lucky, young fellow, for otherwise I wouldn't have met you, either!"</p>
