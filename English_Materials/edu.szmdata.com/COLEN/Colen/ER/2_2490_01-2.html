<p class="storyTitle">1. Garage Sale</p>
<p class="radiusBorder">In the United States, it is very common for people to buy second-hand goods as they are useful and much cheaper. But, if you were a foreign student in America, would you know where to buy them?</p>

<p>Garage sales are very common in the United States now. They also have other names such as <i>yard sales</i> or <i>porch sales</i>. Sometimes several families have a joint sale, or a group will have a sale to benefit a charity. They serve many purposes besides cleaning out unwanted items and making money. They also serve as a minor social event, a chance for new neighbors to get acquainted, and a place to pick up needed items inexpensively.</p>
<p>The action takes place in the garage of the Burns home. There are a couple of makeshift tables with a collection of things on them. (Note: the things sold at garage sales can be almost anything&#151;furniture, books, toys, dishes, magazines&#151;anything you can bring in.) Place some things on the stage floor near the front of the stage. Have the tables and big items upstage (at the back) and on the sides. Throughout the play the family can be arranging and pricing items. Mr. Smith and Mrs. Green can move about examining the various things for sale.</p>
<p>As the curtain rises Pat is busily putting prices on bits of paper and pinning or attaching them to various articles. F. S. enters, carrying a box of things to be added to the sale.</p>
