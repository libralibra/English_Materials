<p class="storyTitle">27. The Leopold Locked Room (3)</p>
<p class="radiusBorder">Who was the real murderer? Captain Leopold? Dr Thursby? Or did Monica somehow take her own life? By reading the third part of this "whodunit" you can unfold the ingenious plot and find out how it all happened.</p>
<p>The commissioner sat behind his desk, openly unhappy at being called to headquarters on a Sunday afternoon, and listened bleakly to what Leopold and Fletcher had to tell him. Finally he spread his fingers on the desktop and said, "What you're saying is that the woman wasn't killed until later&#151;that Thursby killed her in the ambulance. But how could he have done that with a pistol that was already in Lieutenant Fletcher's possession, tagged as evidence? And how could he have fired the fatal shot without the ambulance attendants hearing it?"</p>
<p>"I don't know," Leopold admitted.</p>
<p>"Heaven knows, Captain, I'm willing to give you every reasonable chance to prove your innocence. But you have to bring me more than a dress with a hole in it."</p>
<p>"I know," Leopold said. He turned and left the office, with Fletcher tailing behind.</p>
<p>"What now?" Fletcher asked.</p>
<p>"We go talk to Immy Fontaine, my ex-wife's stepbrother."</p>
<p>Though he'd never been friendly with Fontaine, Leopold knew where to find him. The tired man with the gold tooth lived in a big old house overlooking the Sound, where on this summer Sunday they found him in the back yard, cooking hot dogs over a charcoal fire.</p>
<p>He squinted into the sun and said, "I thought you'd be in jail, after what happened."</p>
<p>"For a stepbrother you seem to be taking her death right in stride," Leopold observed, motioning toward the fire.</p>
<p>"I stopped worrying about Monica fifteen years ago."</p>
<p>"What about this man she was with? Dr. Thursby?"</p>
<p>Immy Fontaine chuckled. "If he's a doctor I'm a plumber! He has the fingers of a surgeon, I'll admit, but when I asked him about my son's radius that he broke skiing, Thursby thought it was a leg bone."</p>
<p>"Where's Thursby staying while he's in town?"</p>
<p>"He was at the Towers with Monica."</p>
<p>"He's not there anymore."</p>
<p>Immy Fontaine shrugged.</p>
<p>Fletcher and Leopold drove to the police lab, where they persuaded the Sunday duty officer to let them have a look at the bullet that killed Monica. While Fletcher and the officer stood by in the interests of propriety, Leopold squinted through the microscope at the twin chunks of lead.</p>
<p>"The death bullet is pretty battered," he observed, but he had to admit that the rifling marks were the same. He glanced at the identification tag attached to the test bullet: Test slug fired from Smith &amp; Wesson. 38 Revolver, serial number 2420547.</p>
<p>Leopold turned away with a sigh, then turned back.</p>
<p>2420547.</p>
<p>He fished into his wallet and found his pistol permit. Smith &amp; Wesson 2421622.</p>
<p>"I remembered those two's on the end," he told Fletcher. "That's not my gun."</p>
<p>By Monday morning Leopold had made six long-distance calls to California, working from his desk telephone while Fletcher used the squad-room phone. Then, a little before noon, Leopold, Fletcher, the commissioner, and a man from the district attorney's office took a car and drove up to Boston.</p>
<p>"You're sure you've got it figured?" the commissioner asked Leopold for the third time. "You know we shouldn't allow you to cross the state line while awaiting grand-jury action."</p>
<p>"Look, either you trust me or you don't," Leopold snapped. Behind the wheel Fletcher allowed himself a slight smile, but the man from the D.A.'s office was deadly serious.</p>
<p>"Run over it for us again," the D.A.'s man said.</p>
<p>Leopold sighed and started talking.</p>
<p>"My ex-wife worked in pictures, at times in the technical end of movie-making. On the screen there are a number of ways to simulate a person being shot. An early method was a sort of compressed-air gun fired at the actor from just off-camera. These days, especially in the bloodiest of the Western and war films, they use a tiny explosive charge fitted under the actor's clothes. Of course the body is protected from burns, and the force of it is directed outward. A pouch of fake blood is released by the explosion, adding to the realism of it."</p>
<p>"And this is what Monica did?"</p>
<p>Leopold nodded. "A call to her Hollywood studio confirmed the fact that she worked on a film using this device. I noticed when I met her that she'd gained weight around the bosom, but I never thought to attribute it to the padding and the explosive device. She triggered it when she raised her arm as she screamed at me."</p>
<p>"Any proof?"</p>
<p>"The hole in her dress was just too big to be an entrance hole from a thirty-eight, even fired at close range&#151;too big and too ragged. I can thank Fletcher for spotting that. This morning the lab technicians ran a test on the bloodstains. Some of it was her blood, the rest was chicken blood."</p>
<p>"She was a good actress to fool all those people."</p>
<p>"She knew Dr. Thursby would be the first to examine her. All she had to do was fall over when the explosive charge ripped out the front of her dress."</p>
<p>"What if there had been another doctor at the wedding?"</p>
<p>Leopold shrugged. "Then they would have postponed it. They couldn't take that chance."</p>
<p>"And the gun?"</p>
<p>"I remembered Thursby bumping against me when I first met him. He took my gun and substituted an identical weapon&#151;identical, that is, except for the serial number. He'd fired it just a short time earlier, to complete the illusion. When I drew it I simply played into their hands. There I was, the only person in the room with an apparently dying woman, and a gun that had just been fired."</p>
<p>"But what about the bullet that killed her?"</p>
<p>"Rifling marks on slugs are made by the lands in the rifled barrel of a gun causing grooves in the lead of a bullet. A bullet fired through a smooth tube has no rifling marks."</p>
<p>"What in hell kind of gun has a smooth tube for a barrel?" the commissioner asked.</p>
<p>"A homemade one, like a zip gun. Highly inaccurate, but quite effective when the gun is almost touching the skin of the victim. Thursby fired a shot from the pistol he was to plant on me, probably into a pillow or some other place where he could retrieve the undamaged slug. Then he reused the rifled slug on another cartridge and fired it with his homemade zip gun, right into Monica's heart. The original rifling marks were still visible and no new ones were added."</p>
<p>"The ambulance driver and attendant didn't hear the shot?"</p>
<p>"They would have stayed up front, since he was a doctor riding with a patient. It gave him a chance to get the padded explosive mechanism off her chest, too. Once that was away, I imagine he leaned over her, muffling the zip gun as best he could, and fired the single shot that killed her. Remember, an ambulance on its way to a hospital is a pretty noisy place&#151;it has a siren going all the time."</p>
<p>They were entering downtown Boston now, and Leopold directed Fletcher to a hotel near the Common. "I still don't believe the part about switching the guns," the D.A.'s man objected.</p>
<p>Leopold smiled. "I mean to tell you only one type of person could have managed it&#151;an expert, professional pickpocket. We called all over southern California till we came up with someone who knew Monica and knew she'd dated a man named Thompson who had a pickpocket act. We called Thompson's agent and discovered he's playing a split week at a Boston lounge, and is staying at this hotel."</p>
<p>"What if he couldn't have managed it without your catching on? Or what if you hadn't been wearing your gun?"</p>
<p>"Most detectives wear their guns off-duty. If I hadn't been, or if he couldn't get it, they'd simply have changed their plan. He must have signaled her when he'd safely made the switch."</p>
<p>"Here we are," Fletcher said. "Let's go up."</p>
<p>The Boston police had two men waiting to meet them, and they went up in the elevator to the room registered in the name of Max Thompson. Fletcher knocked on the door, and when it opened, the familiar face of Felix Thursby appeared. He no longer wore the moustache, but he had the same slim surgeon-like fingers that Immy Fontaine had noticed. Not a doctor's fingers, but a pickpocket's.</p>
<p>"We're taking you in for questioning," Fletcher said, and the Boston detectives issued the standard warnings of his legal rights.</p>
<p>Thursby blinked his tired eyes at them and grinned a bit when he recognized Leopold. "She said you were a smart cop."</p>
<p>"Did you have to kill her?" Leopold asked.</p>
<p>"I didn't. I just held the gun there and she pulled the trigger herself. She did it all herself, except for switching the guns. She hated you that much."</p>
<p>"I know," Leopold said quietly, staring at something far away. "But I guess she must have hated herself just as much."</p>
