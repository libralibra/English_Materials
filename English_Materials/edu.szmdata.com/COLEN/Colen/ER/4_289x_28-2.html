<p class="storyTitle">28. An Essay on War</p>
<p class="radiusBorder">It is ironic that, although killing people is regarded as uncivilized, massive killing has occurred in modern wars between "civilized" nations. Although not necessarily advocating war, the author of this essay points out why people are attracted by it. He even discusses some things about war which are usually never talked about. Do you agree with his points of view?</p>
<p>We are all inclined to believe that our generation is more civilized than the generation that preceded ours. From time to time, there is even some substantial evidence that we hold in higher regard such civilized attributes as compassion, pity, remorse, intelligence and a respect for the customs of people different from ourselves.</p>
<p>Why war then?</p>
<p>Some pessimistic historians think the whole society of man runs in cycles and that one of the phases is war. The optimists, on the other hand, think war is not like an eclipse or a flood or a spell of bad weather. They believe that it is more like a disease for which a cure could be found if the cause were known.</p>
<p>Because war is the ultimate drama of life and death, stories and pictures of it are more interesting than those about peace. This is so true that all of us, and perhaps those of us in television more than most, are often caught up in the action of war to the exclusion of the ideas of it.</p>
<p>If it is true, as we would like to think it is, that our age is more civilized than ages past, we must all agree that it's very strange that in the twentieth century, our century, we have killed more than 70 million of our fellowmen on purpose, at war. It is very, very strange that since 1900 more men have killed more other men than in any other seventy years in history.</p>
<p>Probably the reason we are able to do both&#151;that is, believe on the one hand that we are more civilized and on the other hand wage war to kill&#151;is that killing is not so personal an affair in war as it once was. The enemy is invisible. One man doesn't look another in the eye and run him through with a sword. The enemy, dead or alive, is largely unseen. He is killed by remote control: a loud noise, a distant puff or smoke and then&#160;... silence.</p>
<p>The pictures of the victim's wife and children, which he carries in his breast pocket, are destroyed with him. He is not heard to cry out. The question of compassion or pity or remorse does not enter into it. The enemy is not a man, he is a statistic. It is true, too, that more people are being killed at war now than previously because we're better at doing it than we used to be. One man with one modern weapon can kill thousands.</p>
<p>The world's record for killing was set on August 6, 1945, at Hiroshima.</p>
<p>There have been times in history when one tribe attacked another for no good reason except to take its land or its goods, or simply to prove its superiority. But wars are no longer fought without some ethical pretension. People want to believe they're on God's side and He on theirs. One nation does not usually attack another anymore without first having propagandized itself into believing that its motives are honorable. The Japanese didn't attack Pearl Harbor with any sense in their own minds that they were scheming, deceitful or infamous.</p>
<p>Soldiers often look for help to their religion. It was in a frenzy of religious fervor that Japanese Kamikaze pilots died in World War II with eternal glory on their minds. Even a just God, though, listening to victory prayers from both sides, would be understandably confused.</p>
<p>It has always seemed wrong to the people who disapprove of war that we have spent much of our time and half of our money on anti-creation. The military budget of any major power consumes half of everything and leaves us half to live on.</p>
<p>It's interesting that the effective weapons of war aren't developed by warriors, but by engineers. In World War I they made a machine that would throw five hundred pounds of steel fifty miles. They compounded an ingeniously compressed package of liquid fire that would burn people like bugs. The engineers are not concerned with death, though.</p>
<p>The scientist who splits an atom and revolutionizes warfare isn't concerned with warfare; his mind is on that fleck of matter.</p>
<p>And so we have a machine gun a man can carry that will spit out two hundred bullets a minute, each capable of ripping a man in two, although the man who invented it, in all probability, loves his wife, children, dogs, and probably wouldn't kill a butterfly.</p>
<p>Plato said that there never was a good war or a bad peace, and there have always been people who believed this was true. The trouble with the theory is that the absence of war isn't necessarily peace. Maybe the worst thing Adolf Hitler did was to provide evidence for generations to come that any peace is not better than any war. Buchenwald wasn't war.</p>
<p>The generation that had found Adolf Hitler hard to believe, was embarrassed at how reluctant it had been to go help the people of the world who needed help so desperately. That generation determined not to be slow with help again and as a result may have been too quick. A younger generation doesn't understand why the United States went into Vietnam. Having gotten into the war, all it wanted to consider itself a winner was to get out. Unable to make things the way it wanted them, but unwilling to accept defeat, it merely changed what it wanted.</p>
<p>Dwight Eisenhower, 1962: "I think it's only defense, self-defense, that's all it is."</p>
<p>John Kennedy, 1963: "In the final analysis it's their war. They are the ones that have to win it or lose it."</p>
<p>Lyndon Johnson, 1969: "But America has not changed her essential position. And that purpose is peaceful settlement."</p>
<p>Richard Nixon, 1974: "But the time has come to end this war."</p>
<p>There are a lot of reasons for the confusion about a war. One of them is that the statesmen who make the decisions never have to fight one themselves. Even the generals don't fight the battles.</p>
<p>Professional soldiers often say they hate war, but they would be less than human if they did not, just once, want to play the game they spent a lifetime practicing. How could you go to West Point for four years and not be curious about whether you'd be any good in a war?</p>
<p>Even in peacetime, nations keep huge armies. The trouble with any peacetime all-voluntary army is that the enlisted men in one are often no smarter than the officers. During a war when the general population takes up arms, the character of any army changes for the better.</p>
<p>In the twentieth century there is open rebellion between the people who decide about whether to fight or not and some of the young men being asked to do the fighting. It hasn't always been that way. Through the years, even the reluctant draftees have usually gone to battle with some enthusiasm for it. Partially the enthusiasm comes from the natural drama of war and the excitement of leaving home on a crusade. It's a trip to somewhere else, and with the excitement inherent in an uncertain return. It is a great adventure, with the possibility of being killed the one drawback to an otherwise exciting time in life.</p>
<p>There have been just and unjust wars throughout history but there is very little difference in the manner in which people have been propagandized to believe in them. Patriotism, sometimes no more knowing or sophisticated than pride in a high-school football team, is the strongest motivator. With flags enough and martial music enough, anyone's blood begins to boil.</p>
<p>Patriotism has always been considered one of the good things to have in any nation on earth, but it's a question whether patriotism has been a force for good or evil in the world.</p>
<p>Once the young men of a country get into a battle, most of them are neither heroes nor cowards. They're swept up in a movement that includes them and they go where they're told to go, do what they're told to do. It isn't long before they're tired and afraid and they want to go home.</p>
<p>The bravery is always highly regarded because we recognize that someone has done something that is good for all of us, certainly at the risk and possibly at the expense of his own life. But in war, the mantle of virtue is pressed on every soldier's head as though they were all heroes. This is partly because everyone else is grateful to him and wants to encourage him to keep at it. All soldiers who come home alive are heaped with the praise that belongs to very few of them&#160;... and often to the dead they left behind.</p>
<p>In part, at least, this accounts for why so many men like being ex-soldiers. Once the war and the fighting are done with and they are safe at home, it matters not that they may have served in the 110th emergency shoe-repair battalion. In their own eyes, they are heroes of the front lines.</p>
<p>Even in retrospect, though, a nation has always felt an obligation to honor its warriors. The face of the earth is covered with statuary designed for this purpose which is so bad in many cases that were it not in honor of the dead, it would evoke not tears but laughter.</p>
<p>Bravery is as rare in war as it is in peace. It isn't just a matter of facing danger from which you would prefer to run. If a man faces danger because the alternative to doing that is worse or because he doesn't understand the danger, this may make him a good soldier but it is something other than bravery.</p>
<p>The average bright young man who is drafted hates the whole business because an army always tries to eliminate the individual differences in men. The theory is that a uniformity of action is necessary to achieve a common goal. That's good for an army but terrible for an individual who likes himself the way he is.</p>
<p>Some men, of course, like the order imposed on them. They like the freedom from making hard decisions that mindless submission to authority gives them.</p>
<p>Everyone talks as though there was nothing good about war, but there are some good things and it's easy to see why so many people are attracted by it. If there were no good things about war, the chances are we would find a way not to have another.</p>
<p>A nation at war feels a unity it senses at no other time. Even the people not fighting are bound together. There is a sense of common cause missing in peacetime. Accomplishments are greater, change is quicker&#160;... and if progress is motion, there is more of it in wartime. A nation at peace is busy gratifying itself, overeating, overdressing, lying in the sun until it's time to eat and drink again.</p>
<p>If war brings out the worst in people as it has been assumed it does, it also brings out the very best. It's the ultimate competition. Most of us live our lives at half speed, using only as much of our ability as is absolutely necessary to make out. But at war if a man is actually fighting it, he uses all his brain and all his muscle. He explores depths of his emotions he didn't know were down there and might never have occasion to use again in his lifetime. He lives at full speed, finding strength he didn't know he had, accomplishing things he didn't know he could do.</p>
<p>The best thing about war is hard to describe, is never talked about. Most of us get a warm sense of fellow feeling when we act in close and successful relationship with others, and maybe that happens more in war than any other time. There is a lonesomeness about life that no one who has experienced it likes to talk about, and acting together for a common cause, men often come closest to what they ought to be at their very best.</p>
<p>It is paradoxical but true that in war when man is closest to death, he is also closest to complete fulfilment and farthest from loneliness. He is dependent, dependable, loved and loving.</p>
<p>And there is another thing about war. If there is love in us, there is hate too and it's apparent that hate springs from the same well as love and just as quickly. No one is proud of it but hate is not an unpleasant emotion and there is no time other than wartime when we are encouraged to indulge ourselves in an orgy of hate.</p>
<p>The worst of war is hell but there isn't much of the worst of it and not many soldiers experience even that much.</p>
<p>A soldier at war doesn't feel the need to answer any questions about it. He is exhausted by the battle.</p>
<p>He is busy destroying and it does not occur to him that he will have to help rebuild the world he is pulling down.</p>
<p>He often mistakes the exultation of victory for a taste of what things will be like for the rest of his life.</p>
<p>And they are only like that for a very short time.</p>
