<p class="storyTitle">13. The Louisiana Purchase</p>
<p class="radiusBorder">No one can imagine what the United States would be like as a nation if the Louisiana Purchase had not been made in the early 19th century. The consequences of that bold and decisive diplomatic action can never be overvalued. How did this purchase take place? Which European country controlled this territory before the purchase? Read this passage, and you will know the answers.</p>
<p>In 1803, the United States paid France $15&#160;000&#160;000 for the Louisiana Territory, an area more than four times the size of France. The land which was bought included everything between the Rocky Mountains and the Mississippi River except Texas. The principal port for the second longest river system in the world was located within this territory. Although few realized it at that time, the purchase included the vast forests of Arkansas and Minnesota, the oil deposits of Oklahoma, the cornfields of Iowa, the wheat-lands of the Dakotas, the copper, silver, and gold of Colorado and Montana, the rice and sugar of Louisiana. Without doubt, the Louisiana Purchase was one of the greatest events in the history of the United States. In a single action, a third-class nation doubled its size, united its states and population, and became a great power in the world.</p>
<p>Shortly before 1800, half a million Americans were living west of the Allegheny Mountains. The settlers in the towns and villages there needed trade. In order to get trade, they had to send their flour, tobacco, and whisky by water. There were no usable roads to the eastern cities and ports. The Ohio River and the Mississippi served as direct highways. The entire Mississippi, except its mouth at New Orleans, was open to the settlers. Spain owned New Orleans and the great Louisiana Territory to the west of the river. The western settlers solved their problem by obtaining the "right of deposit" from Spain. This gave the settlers the right to unload their freight at New Orleans and put it in warehouses before shipping it to the east.</p>
<p>On paper, Don Carlos IV ruled the great Spanish Empire. However, Don Carlos was a weak ruler, and Europe was controlled by Napoleon Bonaparte's armies. England was the only nation not under French control. The Spanish ruler was forced to turn over Louisiana to Napoleon through a secret treaty in 1800. This was part of Napoleon's plan. At that time, Napoleon boasted that he would soon be the master of the world. He planned to rebuild the French Empire in the New World. Napoleon called off the war against England. He could not continue his war against England and win the New World at the same time. Napoleon needed a naval base in order to defend his new lands in America. In 1801, Napoleon attacked the West Indian island of Santo Domingo. This island was a French colony, but the Negro slave Toussaint L'Ouverture had weakened French power on this island through revolt.</p>
<p>President Jefferson was greatly concerned over these developments. In a letter to Robert R. Livingston, the American minister to France, he pointed out that three eighths of the nation's annual product had to pass through New Orleans. Jefferson saw one possible solution. He asked Congress to grant the great amount of $2&#160;000&#160;000. Then he instructed Livingston to try to buy New Orleans and West Florida from Napoleon. In Paris, Livingston presented the offer to the clever Talleyrand, Napoleon's Foreign Minister. Livingston tried to talk down the value of the port, but Talleyrand showed no interest.</p>
<p>In 1803, Jefferson's worst fears came true. Spain took the "right of deposit" at New Orleans away from American citizens. The news began to travel through the Kentucky and Ohio region. Many of the settlers prepared to go to New Orleans to fight. Alexander Hamilton wanted to take New Orleans by force. The Westerners, who were Jefferson's principal supporters, turned to him for help. President Jefferson was in a difficult position. He wanted to keep peace, but he knew the importance of New Orleans to the Westerners and to the entire national economy.</p>
<p>Jefferson decided to send James Monroe to help Livingston in Paris. In the meantime, Livingston had another talk with Talleyrand. After a short conversation, Talleyrand asked an amazing question. "What will you give us for the whole Louisiana Territory?" Of course, Livingston was shocked. He had the authority to buy only a little city and the coastline of Florida. Nevertheless, he decided to offer $4&#160;000&#160;000. This was not enough for Louisiana, Talleyrand said, but Livingston had made the decision to buy Louisiana. Shortly after that, Monroe arrived in Paris with the authority to offer as much as $10&#160;000&#160;000 for New Orleans and West Florida. Monroe immediately agreed that Livingston had made the correct decision regarding the larger territory. They sent a message to President Jefferson, but they knew that they could not receive a reply in less than a month and a half. Although they had no authority from Congress or the Constitution, Livingston and Monroe had to act quickly.</p>
<p>For many days, the two Americans discussed details concerning the price with Barbe-Marbois, Napoleon's Minister of the Treasury. The last days of April 1803 were the critical period. At last, Livingston and Monroe could bring the price no lower. Napoleon wanted $15&#160;000&#160;000 for the Louisiana Territory. This sum was more than the total annual income of the United States! Livingston and Monroe courageously decided to trust their government to support them. They signed an agreement with Barbe-Marbois on May 2, 1803. On May 18, war broke out between England and France. Four days later, Napoleon signed the agreement.</p>
<p>President Jefferson and Congress were enthusiastic about the purchase. A great celebration was held when the news reached Washington. Crowds of happy people came to the White House to congratulate Jefferson. On the Fourth of July, a salute was fired by 21 cannons to announce the bloodless victory. Before the purchase, Jefferson had always followed the Constitution strictly. However, he knew this was the greatest bargain in history even though the Constitution did not give the government the power to acquire more territory. He finally accepted the agreement and asked Congress to support him. Of course, some people objected loudly, but the vast majority of the population supported Jefferson. The Senate ratified the agreement and the Louisiana Territory became part of the United States.</p>
<p>Why did Napoleon decide to sell the Louisiana Territory? Probably no one will ever know all of the facts. However, it is possible to guess certain things. His plan of conquering the New World had not gone well. His French soldiers had won an important battle and had captured Toussaint, the Negro leader. However, the Haitians continued to attack the French, and then yellow fever destroyed Napoleon's army. In January of 1803, Napoleon received the news that General Leclere was dead in Santo Domingo. Napoleon also received the news that there were 20 British warships in the Gulf of Mexico. These British ships were ready to capture New Orleans. Napoleon knew that he could not defend Louisiana without strong support from Santo Domingo. He was on the verge of war with England anyway, and the French treasury was not in good condition. It was better, he probably decided, to sell this wasteland immediately and use the money for gunpowder and ships.</p>
<p>A few days after the news of the purchase reached Washington, Jefferson sent Lewis and Clark on an expedition to the Pacific Ocean in the Northwest. Today this epic journey is called the Lewis and Clark Expedition. Because of their reports, the United States began to realize the true value of this great territory. The reports of these two men also prepared the way for a great westward movement of settlers from Ohio, Kentucky, and every other part of the United States.</p>
