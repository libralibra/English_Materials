<p class="storyTitle">12. How to Be an Employee (2)</p>
<p class="radiusBorder">Now that you understand the necessity of being an employee, one day you will also need to make a choice among hundreds of kinds of jobs. How do you choose your favorite job, a job for which you are probably temperamentally fitted and which offers a good salary? Read on, as Peter F. Drucker provides you with several guidelines to follow.</p>
<p>The next question to ask is: what kind of employee should you be? Pay no attention to what other people tell you. This is one question only you can answer. It involves a choice in four areas&#151;a choice you alone can make, and one you cannot easily duck. But to make the choice you must first have tested yourself in the world of jobs for some time.</p>
<p>Here are the four decisions in brief outline, then the first decision in more detail:</p>
<p>1. Do you belong in a job calling primarily for faithfulness in the performance of routine work and promising security? Or do you belong in a job that offers a challenge to imagination and ingenuity&#151;with the attendant penalty for failure?</p>
<p>2. Do you belong in a large organization or in a small organization? Do you work better through channels or through direct contacts? Do you enjoy more being a small cog in a big and powerful machine or a big wheel in a small machine?</p>
<p>3. Should you start at the bottom and try to work your way up, or should you try to start near the top? On the lowest rung of the promotional ladder, with its solid and safe footing but also with a very long climb ahead? Or on the aerial trapeze of "a management trainee", or some other staff position close to management?</p>
<p>4. Finally, are you going to be more effective and happy as a specialist or as a "generalist", that is, in an administrative job?</p>
<p>The decision between secure routine work and insecure work challenging the imagination and ingenuity is the one decision most people find easiest to make. You know very soon what kind of person you are. Do you find real satisfaction in the precision, order, and system of a clearly laid-out job? Do you prefer the security not only of knowing what your work is today and what it is going to be tomorrow, but also security in your job, in your relationship to the people above, below, and next to you, and economic security? Or are you one of those people who tend to grow impatient with anything that looks like a "routine" job? These people are usually able to live in a confused situation in which their relations to the people around them are neither clear nor stable. And they tend to pay less attention to economic security, find it not too upsetting to change jobs, etc.</p>
<p>There is, of course, no such black-and-white distinction between people. The man who can do only painstaking detail work and has no imagination is not much good for anything. Neither is the self-styled "genius" who has nothing but grandiose ideas and no capacity for rigorous application to detail. But in practically everybody I have ever met there is a decided leaning one way or the other.</p>
<p>The difference is one of basic personality. It is not too much affected by a man's experiences; for he is likely to be born with the one or the other. The need for economic security is often as not an outgrowth of a need for psychological security rather than a phenomenon of its own. But precisely because the difference is one of basic temperament, the analysis of what kind of temperament you possess is so vital. A man might be happy in work for which he has little aptitude. He might be quite successful in it. But he can be neither happy nor successful in a job for which he is temperamentally unfitted.</p>
<p>You hear a great many complaints today about the excessive security-consciousness of our young people. My complaint is the opposite: in the large organizations especially, there are not enough job opportunities for those young people who need challenge and risk. Jobs in which there is greater emphasis on conscientious performance of well-organized duties rather than on imagination&#151;especially for the beginner&#151;are to be found, for instance, in the inside jobs in banking or insurance, which normally offer great job security but not rapid promotion or large pay. The same is true of most government work, of the railroad industry, particularly in the clerical and engineering branches, and of most public utilities. The bookkeeping and accounting areas, especially in the larger companies, are generally of this type, too&#151;though a successful comptroller is an accountant with great management and business imagination.</p>
<p>At the other extreme are such areas as buying, selling, and advertising, in which the emphasis is on adaptability, on imagination, and on a desire to do new and different things. In those areas, by and large, there is little security, either personal or economic. The rewards, however are high and come more rapidly. Major premium on imagination&#151;though of a different kind and coupled with dogged persistence on details&#151;prevails in most research and engineering work. Jobs in production, as supervisor or executive, also demand much adaptability and imagination.</p>
<p>Contrary to popular belief, a very small business requires, above all, close attention to daily routine. Running a neighborhood drugstore or a small grocery, or being a toy jobber, is largely attention to details. But in a very small business there is also room for quite a few people of the other personality type&#151;the innovator or imaginer. If successful, a man of this type soon ceases to be in a very small business. For the real innovator there is, still, no more promising opportunity in this country than that of building a large out of a very small business.</p>
