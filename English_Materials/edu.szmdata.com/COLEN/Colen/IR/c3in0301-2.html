<p class="storyTitle">WHY I TEACH</p>
<p class="storyAuthor">Peter G. Beidler</p>
<p>
Why do you teach?
My friend asked the question when I told him that I didn't want to be considered for an administrative position.
He was puzzled that I did not want what was obviously a "step up" toward what all Americans are taught to want when they grow up:
money and power.
</p>
<p>
Certainly I don't teach because teaching is easy for me.
Teaching is the most difficult of the various ways I have attempted to earn my living:
mechanic, carpenter, writer.
For me, teaching is a red-eye, sweaty-palm, sinking-stomach profession.
Red-eye, because I never feel ready to teach no matter how late I stay up preparing.
Sweaty-palm, because I'm always nervous before I enter the classroom, sure that I will be found out for the fool that I am.
Sinking-stomach, because I leave the classroom an hour later convinced that I was even more boring than usual.
</p>
<p>
Nor do I teach because I think I know answers, or because I have knowledge I feel compelled to share.
Sometimes I am amazed that my students actually take notes on what I say in class!
</p>
<p>
Why, then, do I teach?
</p>
<p>
I teach because I like the pace of the academic calendar.
June, July, and August offer an opportunity for reflection, research, and writing.
</p>
<p>
I teach because teaching is a profession built on change.
When the material is the same, I change&#151;and, more important, my students change.
</p>
<p>
I teach because I like the freedom to make my own mistakes, to learn my own lessons, to stimulate myself and my students.
As a teacher, I'm my own boss.
If I want my freshmen to learn to write by creating their own textbook, who is to say I can't?
Such courses may be huge failures, but we can all learn from failures.
</p>
<p>
I teach because I like to ask questions that students must struggle to answer.
The world is full of right answers to bad questions.
While teaching, I sometimes find good questions.
</p>
<p>
I teach because I enjoy finding ways of getting myself and my students out of the ivory tower and into the real world.
I once taught a course called "Self-Reliance in a Technological Society."
My 15 students read Emerson, Thoreau, and Huxley.
They kept diaries.
They wrote term papers.
</p>
<p>
But we also set up a corporation, borrowed money, purchased a rundown house and practiced self-reliance by renovating it.
At the end of the semester, we sold the house, repaid our loan, paid our taxes, and distributed the profits among the group.
</p>
<p>
So teaching gives me pace, and variety, and challenge, and the opportunity to keep on learning.
</p>
<p>
I have left out, however, the most important reasons why I teach.
</p>
<p>
One is Vicky.
My first doctoral student, Vicky was an energetic student who labored at her dissertation on a little-known 14th century poet.
She wrote articles and sent them off to learned journals.
She did it all herself, with an occasional nudge from me.
But I was there when she finished her dissertation, learned that her articles were accepted, got a job and won a fellowship to Harvard working on a book developing ideas she'd first had as my student.
</p>
<p>
Another reason is George, who started as an engineering student, then switched to English because he decided he liked people better than things.
</p>
<p>
There is Jeanne, who left college, but was brought back by her classmates because they wanted her to see the end of the self-reliance house project.
I was there when she came back.
I was there when she told me that she later became interested in the urban poor and went on to become a civil rights lawyer.
</p>
<p>
There is Jacqui, a cleaning woman who knows more by intuition than most of us learn by analysis.
Jacqui has decided to finish high school and go to college.
</p>
<p>
These are the real reasons I teach, these people who grow and change in front of me.
Being a teacher is being present at the creation, when the clay begins to breathe.
</p>
<p>
A "promotion" out of teaching would give me money and power.
But I have money.
I get paid to do what I enjoy:
reading, talking with people, and asking questions like, "What is the point of being rich?"
</p>
<p>
And I have power.
I have the power to nudge, to fan sparks, to suggest books, to point out a pathway.
What other power matters?
</p>
<p>
But teaching offers something besides money and power:
it offers love.
Not only the love of learning and of books and ideas, but also the love that a teacher feels for that rare student who walks into a teacher's life and begins to breathe.
Perhaps love is the wrong word:
magic might be better.
</p>
<p>
I teach because, being around people who are beginning to breathe, I occasionally find myself catching my breath with them.
</p>
