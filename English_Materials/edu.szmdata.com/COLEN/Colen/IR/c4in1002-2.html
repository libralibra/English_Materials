<p>
Whether work should be placed among the causes of happiness or among the causes of unhappiness may perhaps be regarded as a doubtful question.
There is certainly much work which is exceedingly troublesome, and an excess of work is always very painful.
I think, however, that, provided work is not excessive in amount, even the dullest work is to most people less painful than idleness.
There are in work all grades, from mere relief of tediousness up to the profoundest delights, according to the nature of the work and the abilities of the worker.
Most of the work that most people have to do is not in itself interesting, but even such work has certain great advantages.
To begin with, it fills a good many hours of the day without the need of deciding what one shall do.
Most people, when they are left free to fill their own time according to their own choice, are at a loss to think of anything sufficiently pleasant to be worth doing.
And whatever they decide on, they are troubled by the feeling that something else would have been pleasanter.
To be able to fill leisure intelligently is the last product of civilization, and at present very few people have reached this level.
Moreover the exercise of choice is in itself tiresome.
Except to people with unusual initiative it is positively agreeable to be told what to do at each hour of the day, provided the orders are not too unpleasant.
Most of the idle rich suffer unspeakable boredom as the price of their freedom from drudgery.
At times, they may find relief by hunting big game in Africa, or by flying round the world, but the number of such sensations is limited, especially after youth is past.
Accordingly the more intelligent rich men work nearly as hard as if they were poor, while rich women for the most part keep themselves busy with innumerable trifles of whose earthshaking importance they are firmly persuaded.
</p>
<p>
Work therefore is desirable, first and foremost, as a preventive of boredom, for the boredom that a man feels when he is doing necessary though uninteresting work is as nothing in comparison with the boredom that he feels when he has nothing to do with his days.
With this advantage of work another is associated, namely that it makes holidays much more delicious when they come.
Provided a man does not have to work so hard as to weaken his vigor, he is likely to find far more zest in his free time than an idle man could possibly find.
</p>
<p>
The second advantage of most paid work and of some unpaid work is that it gives chances of success and opportunities for ambition.
In most work success is measured by income, and while our capitalistic society continues, this is inevitable.
It is only where the best work is concerned that this measure ceases to be the natural one to apply.
The desire that men feel to increase their income is quite as much a desire for success as for the extra comforts that a higher income can obtain.
However dull work may be, it becomes bearable if it is a means of building up reputation, whether in the world at large or only in one's own circle.
Continuity of purpose is one of the most essential ingredients of happiness in the long run, and for most men this comes chiefly through their work.
In this respect those women whose lives are occupied with housework are much less fortunate than men, or than women who work outside the home.
The domesticated wife does not receive wages, has no means of bettering herself, is taken for granted by her husband (who sees practically nothing of what she does), and is valued by him not for her housework but for quite other qualities.
Of course this does not apply to those women who are sufficiently well-to-do to make beautiful houses and beautiful gardens and become the envy of their neighbors;
but such women are comparatively few, and for the great majority housework cannot bring as much satisfaction as work of other kinds brings to men and to professional women.
</p>
<p>
The satisfaction of killing time and of affording some outlet, however modest, for ambition, belongs to most work, and is sufficient to make even a man whose work is dull happier on the average than a man who has no work at all.
But when work is interesting, it is capable of giving satisfaction of a far higher order than mere relief from tediousness.
</p>
<p>
The chief element which makes work interesting is the exercise of skill.
Every man who has acquired some unusual skill enjoys exercising it until it has become a matter of course, or until he can no longer improve himself.
This motive to activity begins in early childhood:
a boy who can stand on his head becomes reluctant to stand on his feet.
A great deal of work gives the same pleasure that is to be derived from games of skill.
The work of a lawyer or a politician must contain in a more delightful form a great deal of the same pleasure that is to be derived from playing bridge.
Here of course there is not only the exercise of skill but the conquering of a skilled opponent.
Even where this competitive element is absent, however, the performance of rare skills is agreeable.
A man who can do stunts in an aeroplane finds the pleasure so great that for the sake of it he is willing to risk his life.
I imagine that an able surgeon, in spite of the painful circumstances in which his work is done, derives satisfaction from the wonderful precision of his operations.
The same kind of pleasure, though in a less intense form, is to be derived from a great deal of work of a humbler kind.
All skilled work can be pleasurable, provided the skill required is either variable or capable of indefinite improvement.
If these conditions are absent, it will cease to be interesting when a man has acquired his maximum skill.
A man who runs three-mile races will cease to find pleasure in this occupation when he passes the age at which he can beat his own previous record.
Fortunately there is a very considerable amount of work in which new circumstances call for new skill and a man can go on improving, at any rate until he has reached middle age.
In some kinds of skilled work, such as politics, for example, it seems that men are at their best between sixty and seventy, the reason being that in such occupations a wide experience of other men is essential.
For this reason successful politicians are apt to be happier at the age of seventy than any other men of equal age.
Their only competitors in this respect are the men who are the heads of big businesses.
