<p class="storyTitle">MY FIRST JOB</p>
<p class="storyAuthor">Robert Best</p>
<p>
While I was waiting to enter university, I saw advertised in a local newspaper a teaching post at a school in a suburb of London about ten miles from where I lived.
Being very short of money and wanting to do something useful, I applied, fearing as I did so, that without a degree and with no experience in teaching my chances of getting the job were slim.
</p>
<p>
However, three days later a letter arrived, asking me to go to Croydon for an interview.
It proved an awkward journey:
a train to Croydon station;
a ten-minute bus ride and then a walk of at least a quarter of a mile.
As a result I arrived on a hot June morning too depressed to feel nervous.
</p>
<p>
The school was a red brick house with big windows.
The front garden was a gravel square;
four evergreen shrubs stood at each corner, where they struggled to survive the dust and fumes from a busy main road.
</p>
<p>
It was clearly the headmaster himself that opened the door.
He was short and fat.
He had a sandy-coloured moustache, a wrinkled forehead and hardly any hair.
</p>
<p>
He looked at me with an air of surprised disapproval, as a colonel might look at a private whose bootlaces were undone.
'Ah yes.'
he grunted.
'You'd better come inside.'
The narrow, sunless hall smelled unpleasantly of stale cabbage;
the walls were dirty with ink marks;
it was all silent.
His study, judging by the crumbs on the carpet, was also his dining-room.
'You'd better sit down,' he said, and proceeded to ask me a number of questions:
what subjects I had taken in my General School Certificate;
how old I was;
what games I played;
then fixing me suddenly with his bloodshot eyes, he asked me whether I thought games were a vital part of a boy's education.
I mumbled something about not attaching too much importance to them.
He grunted.
I had said the wrong thing.
The headmaster and I obviously had very little in common.
</p>
<p>
The school, he said, consisted of one class of twenty-four boys, ranging in age from seven to thirteen.
I should have to teach all subjects except art, which he taught himself.
Football and cricket were played in the Park, a mile away on Wednesday and Saturday afternoons.
</p>
<p>
The teaching set-up filled me with fear.
I should have to divide the class into three groups and teach them in turn at three different levels;
and I was dismayed at the thought of teaching algebra and geometry&#151;two subjects at which I had been completely incompetent at school.
Worse perhaps was the idea of Saturday afternoon cricket;
most of my friends would be enjoying leisure at that time.
</p>
<p>
I said shyly, 'What would my salary be?'
'Twelve pounds a week plus lunch.'
Before I could protest, he got to his feet.
'Now,' he said, 'you'd better meet my wife.
She's the one who really runs this school.'
</p>
<p>
This was the last straw.
I was very young:
the prospect of working under a woman constituted the ultimate indignity.
</p>
