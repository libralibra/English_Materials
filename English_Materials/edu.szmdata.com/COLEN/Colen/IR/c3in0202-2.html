<p>
American Civil War (1861-1865).
A war between the U.S. and 11 Southern states which seceded from the Union and formed the Confederate States of America.
</p>
<p>
The war was the result of long-standing social and economic differences between North and South that gradually became apparent after the War of 1812.
Sectional conflict over such issues as the tariff and the extension of slavery was temporarily abated by the activities of men such as Henry CLAY and Daniel WEBSTER, but in the 1850's the position of each side became progressively more rigid;
whether the war could have been averted is still a subject for discussion among historians.
</p>
<p>
Upon receiving the news of Abraham LINCOLN'S election in 1860, South Carolina seceded, followed by 10 other Southern states, which then organized the Confederate government and elected Jefferson DAVIS president early in 1861 with the Confederate attack on Fort SUMTER, the actual fighting began.
To the North, the principal objective was the preservation of the Union, though emancipation of the slaves became a secondary aim after 1862.
</p>
<p>
Although Union hopes for a quick victory were dashed by the rout at BULL RUN, it gradually became evident that, despite the brilliant leadership of such Confederate generals as Robert E. LEE and Thomas (" Stonewall") JACKSON, the superior human and industrial resources of the North would ultimately prevail.
This was especially true after the Union victory at GETTYSBURG and Gen. GRANT's successful siege of Vicksburg (1863) ended Confederate hopes of securing foreign recognition and aid.
In 1864, Grant, now supreme commander of the Union forces, turned to the conquest of Richmond, the Confederate capital, while W. T. SHERMAN undertook his famous march to the sea.
After a gallant defense, Lee was forced to evacuate Richmond (April 2, 1865) and surrendered to Grant at Appomattox Courthouse, Va., on April 9.
</p>
<p>
With the possible exception of the Napoleonic Wars, no other conflict has produced more books.
Among the most famous of the novels inspired by the war are Stephen Crane's RED BADGE OF COURAGE, Winston Churchill's THE CRISIS, and Margaret Mitchell's GONE WITH THE WIND. Other novelists who wrote about the war include Thomas Nelson PAGE, Mary JOHNSTON, Ellen GLASGOW, and MacKinlay KANTOR.
Verse dealing with the war was written by such poets as Henry TIMROD, Paul Hamilton HAYNE, John Greenleaf WHITTIER, Walt WHITMAN, and Stephen Vincent BENET.
Edmund Wilson's PATRIOTIC GORE (1962) consists of essays about 19th-century Civil War literature.
