<p class="storyTitle">BLACK BOY</p><p>
I held a series of jobs for short periods, quitting some in disgust, being fired from others because of my attitude, my speech, or the look in my eyes.
I was no nearer than ever to my goal of saving enough money to leave town.
At times I doubted if I ever could.
</p>
<p>
One jobless morning I went to my old classmate, Griggs, who worked for a Capitol Street jeweller.
He was washing the windows of the store when I came up to him.
</p>
<p>
"Do you know where I can find a job?"
I asked.
He looked at me with scorn.
</p>
<p>
"Yes, I know where you can find a job," he said, laughing.
</p>
<p>
"Where?"
</p>
<p>
"But I wonder if you can hold it," he said.
</p>
<p>
"What do you mean?"
I asked.
"Where's the job?"
</p>
<p>
"Take your time," he said.
"Dick, you've been trying to keep a job all summer, and you can't.
Why?
Because you're impatient.
That's your big fault."
</p>
<p>
"Well," I said, eagerly encouraging him to continue.
</p>
<p>
He grew serious.
"There's an optical company upstairs, and the boss is a northerner from Illinois.
He wants a boy to work all day in summer, mornings and evenings in winter.
He wants to start a colored boy in the optical trade.
You know algebra, and you'd be good at this.
I'll tell Mr. Crane about you and get in touch with you."
</p>
<p>
"Do you suppose I could see him now?"
I asked.
</p>
<p>
"For God's sake, take your time!" he thundered at me.
</p>
<p>
"Maybe that's what's wrong with Negroes," I said.
"They take too much time.
I don't want a job sweeping floors.
I plan to make something of myself!"
</p>
<p>
I thanked him and left.
After a week I gave up hope.
Then one afternoon Griggs came to my house.
</p>
<p>
"It looks as if you've got a job," he said.
"You're going to have a chance to learn a trade.
But remember to keep your head.
Remember you're black;
you're working for Whites.
You start tomorrow."
</p>
<p>
"What will I get?"
</p>
<p>
"Five dollars a week to start with;
they'll raise you if they like you," he explained.
</p>
<p>
My hopes grew.
I would have a chance to learn a trade.
And I need not give up school.
I told him I would take the job, that I would be humble and respectful to Whites.
"You'll be working for a White Yankee, and you'll have to try really hard to get along," he said.
</p>
<p>
The next morning I was outside the office of the optical company long before it opened.
I was reminding myself that I must be polite, must think before I spoke, must think before I acted, must say "yes, sir or no, sir," that I must behave myself so that White people wouldn't think that I thought I was so good as they.
Suddenly a White man came up to me.
</p>
<p>
"What do you want?" he asked me.
</p>
<p>
"I'm reporting for a job, sir," I said.
</p>
<p>
"O.K. Come on."
</p>
<p>
I followed him up a flight of steps and he unlocked the door of the office.
I was a little nervous, but the young White man's manner put me at ease, and I sat and held my hat in my hand.
A White girl came in and began punching the typewriter.
Soon another White man, thin and gray, entered and went into the hack room.
Finally, a tall, red-faced White man arrived, shot me a quick glance, and sat down at his desk.
His brisk manner told me he must be a Yankee.
</p>
<p>
"You're the new boy, eh?"
</p>
<p>
"Yes, sir."
</p>
<p>
"Let me get my mail out of the way, and I'll talk with you," he said pleasantly.
</p>
<p>
"Yes, sir."
</p>
<p>
I even tried to keep the tone of my voice low, trying to rob it of any suggestion or overtone of aggressiveness.
</p>
<p>
Half an hour later Mr. Crane called me to his desk and questioned me closely about my schooling, about how much mathematics I had had.
He seemed pleased when I told him that I had had two years of algebra.
</p>
<p>
"How would you like to learn this trade?" he asked.
</p>
<p>
"I'd like it fine, sir.
I'd like nothing better."
I said.
He was treating me so well, being so good to me.
</p>
<p>
He told me that he wanted to train a Negro boy in the optical trade;
he wanted to help him, guide him.
I tried to answer in a way that would let him know that I would try to be worthy of what be was doing.
This was the chance I'd been waiting for&#151;a chance to learn a trade and make something of myself.
After introducing me to the other people in the firm, Mr. Crane said, "Now, boy, let's see how dean you can get this place&#160;...&#160;"
</p>
