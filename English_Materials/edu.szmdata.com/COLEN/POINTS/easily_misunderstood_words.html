	<dt>precede / proceed</dt><dd>The verb <i>precede</i> means to come before. <i>Proceed</i> means to move forward. &#8220;He preceded me into the room; once I caught up with him I proceeded to tell him off.&#8221;</dd>
	<dt>principal / principle</dt><dd><i>Principal</i> is a noun that means a person who holds a high position or plays an important role: &#8220;The school principal has 20 years of teaching experience.&#8221; <i>Principal</i> is also an adjective that means chief or leading: &#8220;The necessity of moving to another city was the principal reason I turned down the job offer.&#8221; <i>Principle</i> is a noun that means a rule or standard: &#8220;They refused to compromise their principles.&#8221;</dd>

	<dt>venal / venial</dt><dd><i>Venal</i> is an adjective that means corruptible; <i>venial</i> is an adjective that means a slight flaw or offense: &#8220;In the Catholic church, a venial sin is one that is minor and pardonable, whereas a mortal sin is a serious transgression involving more venal or depraved behavior.&#8221;</dd>
