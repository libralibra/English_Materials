<p class="storyTitle">Nerds and Geeks</p>
<p class="storyAuthor">Leonid Fridman</p>
<p>
There is something very wrong with the system of values in a society that has only unkind terms like <i>nerd</i> and <i>geek</i> for the intellectually curious and academically serious.
</p>
<p>
We all know what a nerd is:
someone who wears thick glasses and ugly clothes;
someone who knows all the answers to the chemistry or math homework but can never get a date on a Saturday night.
And a geek, according to <i>Webster's New World Dictionary </i>, is a street performer who shocks the public by biting off heads of live chickens.
It is a revealing fact about our language and our culture that someone dedicated to pursuit of knowledge is compared to such a freak.
</p>
<p>
Even at a prestigious educational institution like Harvard, anti-intellectualism is widespread:
Many students are ashamed to admit, even to their friends, how much they study.
Although most students try to keep up their grades, there is but a small group of undergraduates for whom pursuing knowledge is the most important thing during their years at Harvard.
Nerds are looked down upon while athletes are made heroes of.
</p>
<p>
The same thing happens in U.S. elementary and high schools.
Children who prefer to read books rather than play football, prefer to build model airplanes rather than idle away their time at parties with their classmates, become social outcasts.
Because of their intelligence and refusal to conform to society's anti-intellectual values, many are deprived of a chance to learn adequate social skills and acquire good communication tools.
</p>
<p>
Enough is enough.
</p>
<p>
Nerds and geeks must stop being ashamed of what they are.
Those who don't study hard must stop teasing those who do, the bright kids with thick glasses.
The anti-intellectual values that have spread throughout American society must be fought.
</p>
<p>
There are very few countries in the world where anti-intellectualism runs as high in popular culture as it does in the U.S..
In most industrialized nations, not least of all our economic rivals in East Asia, a kid who studies hard is praised and held up as an example to other students.
</p>
<p>
In many parts of the world, university professorships are the most prestigious and materially rewarding positions.
But not in America, where average professional ballplayers are much more respected and better paid than professors of the best universities.
</p>
<p>
How can a country where typical parents are ashamed of their daughter studying mathematics instead of going dancing, or of their son reading Weber while his friends play baseball be expected to compete in the technology race with Japan?
How long can America remain a world-class power if we constantly put social skills and physical strength over academic achievement and intellectual ability?
</p>
<p>
Do we really expect to stay afloat largely by importing our scientists and intellectuals from abroad, as we have done for a major portion of this century without making an effort to also cultivate a pro-intellectual culture at home?
Even if we have the political wilt to spend a lot more money on education than we do now, do we think we can improve our schools if we laugh at our hardworking pupils and fail to respect their impoverished teachers?
</p>
<p>
Our fault lies not so much with our economy or with our politics as within ourselves, our values and our image of a good life.
America's culture has not adapted to the demands of our times, to the economic realities that demand a highly educated workforce and innovative intelligent leadership.
</p>
<p>
If we are to succeed as a society in the 21st century, we had better do away with our anti-intellectualism and teach our children that a good life depends on exercising one's mind and pursuing knowledge to the full extent of one's abilities.
</p>
<p>
Not until the words "nerd" and "geek" become terms of praise rather than insults do we stand a chance.
