<p>
Sometimes it's difficult to describe the values or ideals of a culture from within that culture.However, if one looks at the culture from the outside, certain observations can be made more easily.
It's important to understand American values if you want to understand American behavior.
Certain ways of thinking, acting and communicating are a direct result of cultural values.
The following list of values describes the basic values of many Americans (even a majority of Americans).
For each entry in the list of American values, a "contrasting value" is given.
Each of these opposite values may be found among some Americans (particularly those belonging to certain minority groups), but for the most part is more typical of people in non-Western cultures of the world.
