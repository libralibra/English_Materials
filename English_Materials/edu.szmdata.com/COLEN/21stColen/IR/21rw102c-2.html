<p class="storyTitle">How to improve your Vocabulary</p>
<p class="storyAuthor">Tony Randall</p>
<p>
Words can make us laugh, cry, go to war, fall in love.
Whether you're still in school or you head up a corporation, the better command you have of words, the better chance you have of saying exactly what you mean and of understanding what others mean.
</p>
<p>
English is the richest language&#151;with the largest vocabulary on earth.
Over 1,000,000 words!
</p>
<p>
Yet, the average adult has a vocabulary of only 30,000 to 60,000 words.
Imagine what we're missing!
</p>
<p>
Here are five pieces of advice that help you learn&#151;and remember&#151;whole families of words at a time.
</p>
<p>
What's the first thing to do when you see a word you don't know?
</p>
<p>
1.
Try to guess the meaning of the word from the way it's used.
</p>
<p>
You can often get at least part of a word's meaning just from how it's used in a sentence.
That's why it's so important to read as much as you can&#151;different kinds of things:
magazines, books, newspapers you don't usually read.
The more you expose yourself to new words, the more words you'll pick up just by seeing how they're used.
</p>
<p>
For instance, you run across the word "manacle":
</p>
<p>
"The manacles had been on John's wrists for 30 years.
Only one person had a key&#151;his wife."
</p>
<p>
You have a good idea of what "manacles" are&#151;just from the context of the sentence.
</p>
<p>
But let's find out exactly what the word means and where it comes from.
The only way to do this, and to build a large vocabulary fast, is to go to the dictionary.
</p>
<p>
2.
Look it up.
</p>
<p>
Here's the definition for "manacle" in an English dictionary.
</p>
<p>
Manacle n.
[Usually plural] 1.
A device for confining the hands;
a handcuff.
2.
Anything that confines or restrains.
[From Latin manicula, diminutive of manus, hand.]
</p>
<p>
The first definition fits here.
</p>
<p>
Well, that's what you thought it meant.
But what's the idea behind the word?
</p>
<p>
What are its roots?
</p>
<p>
Here's where the detective work&#151;and the fun&#151;begins.
</p>
<p>
3.
Dig the meaning out by the roots.
</p>
<p>
The root is the basic part of the word.
(Most of our roots come from Latin and Greek words at least 2,000 years old.)
</p>
<p>
Learning the roots 1) helps us remember words;
2) gives us a deeper understanding of the words we already know;
and 3) allows us to pick up whole families of new words at a time.
</p>
<p>
Notice the root of "manacle" is manus (Latin) meaning "hand".
</p>
<p>
Well, that makes sense.
Now, other words with this root, man, start to make sense, too.
</p>
<p>
Take manual&#151;something done "by hand" (manual labour) or a "handbook".
And manage&#151;to "handle" something (as a manager).
When you manufacture something, you "make it by hand" (in its original meaning).
And when you finish your first novel, your publisher will see your originally "handwritten"&#151;manuscript.
</p>
<p>
Imagine!
A whole new world of words opens up&#151;just from one simple root!
The root gives the basic clue to the meaning of a word.
But there's another important clue&#151;the prefix.
</p>
<p>
4.
Get the powerful prefixes under your belt.
</p>
<p>
A prefix is the part that's sometimes attached to the front of a word.
There aren't many&#151;less than 100 major prefixes&#151;and you'll learn them in no time at all just by becoming more aware of the meanings of words you already know.
Here are a few.
</p>
<p>
(A table:
omitted)
</p>
<p>
Now, see how the prefix (along with the context) helps you get the meaning of the underlined word:
</p>
<p>
"Oh, that snake's not poisonous.
It's a completely innocuous little garden snake."
(The literal meaning of innocuous is "not harmful".)
</p>
<p>
Now, you've got some new words.
What are you going to do with them?
</p>
<p>
5.
Put your new words to work at once
</p>
<p>
Use them several times the first day you learn them.
Say them out loud!
Write them in sentences.
</p>
<p>
Should you "use" them on friends?
Careful&#151;it depends on the situation.
You know when a word sounds natural and when it sounds stuffy.
</p>
<p>
How about your enemies?
Ask one of them if he's read that article on pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis.
(You really can find it in the dictionary.)
</p>
<p>
Now, you're one up on him.
</p>
<p>
That's all there is to it&#151;you're off on your treasure hunt.
</p>
<p>
Aristophanes said, "By words, the mind is excited and the spirit elated."
It's as true today as it was when he said it in Athens&#151;2,400 years ago!
</p>
