<p class="storyTitle">Our Changing Lifestyle: Trends and Fads</p>
<p class="storyAuthor"></p>
<p>
These days lifestyles seem to change very fast.
It is more than just clothing and hairstyles that are in style one year and out of date the next;
it's a whole way of living.
One year people wear sunglasses on top of their heads and wear jeans and boots;
they drink white wine and eat sushi at Japanese restaurants;
for exercise they jog several miles a day.
However, the next year they notice that everything has changed.
Women wear long skirts;
people drink expensive water from France and eat pasta at Italian restaurants;
everyone seems to be exercising at health clubs.
</p>
<p>
Almost nothing in modern life escapes the influence of fashion;
food, music, exercise, books, slang words, movies, furniture, places to visit, even names go in and out of fashion.
It's almost impossible to write about specific fads because these interests that people follow can change very quickly.
</p>
<p>
In the United States, even people can be "in" or "out."
Like people in any country, Americans enjoy following the lives of celebrities:
movie stars, sports heroes, famous artists, politicians, and the like.
But Americans also pay a lot of attention to people who have no special ability and have done nothing very special.
In 1981, for example, an unknown elderly woman appeared in a TV commercial in which she looked at a very small hamburger and complained loudly, "Where's the beef?"
These three words made her famous.
Suddenly she appeared in magazines and newspapers and on TV shows.
She was immediately popular.
She was "in."
In 1987 an exterminator in Dallas, Texas decided that he would be very happy if he could find more customers for his small business;
he needed more people to pay him to kill the insects and rats in their houses.
He put an unusual advertisement in a Dallas newspaper:
He offered to pay $1,000 to the person who could find the biggest cockroach.
This strange offer made him suddenly famous.
However, this kind of fame does not last long.
Such people are famous for a very short time.
They are fads.
</p>
<p>
What causes such fads to come and go?
And why do so many people follow them?
Although clothing designers and manufacturers influence fads in fashion because they want to make a profit, this desire for money doesn't explain fads in other areas, such as language.
For example, why have teenagers in the past twenty-five years used&#151;at different times&#151;the slang words groovy, or awesome, in conversation instead of simply saying wonderful?
According to Jack Santino, an expert in popular culture, people who follow fads are not irrational;
they simply want to be part of something new and creative, and they feel good when they are part of an "in-group".
Fads are not unique to the United States.
Dr. Santino believes that fads are common in any country that has a strong consumer economy, e.g., Britain, Japan, and Germany.
However, in the United States there is an additional reason for fads:
Most Americans seem to feel that something is wrong if there isn't frequent change in their lives.
</p>
<p>
Dr. Santino points out that it's sometimes difficult to see the difference between a fad and a trend.
A fad, he says, lasts a very short time and is not very important.
A social trend lasts a long time and becomes a true part of modern culture.
A trend might be the use of personal computers;
a fad might be certain types of computer games.
A recent trend is the nationwide interest in good health, but many fads come from this trend:
aerobic dancing, special diets, imported water, and the like.
</p>
<p>
An exciting trend began in Europe in the mid-1990s:
the cultural borders between countries began to break down.
Travelers from other parts of the world noticed that "Eurokids", from Lisbon to Stockholm, from London to Athens, seemed to be very similar to each other.
All followed the same fads in fashion, music, and food.
These Eurokids had the same lifestyles and values.
For example, they were worried about the environment, concerned more about rain forests than clothes.
Some of the Eurokids' fads will certainly disappear and others will come along, but it will be interesting to see if the trend continues and becomes a true part of European culture.
