<p class="storyTitle">College Lectures: Is Anybody Listening?</p>
<p class="storyAuthor">David Daniels</p>
<p>
A former teacher of mine, Robert A. Fowkes of New York University, likes to tell the story of a class he took in Old English while studying in Germany during the 1930s.
On the first day the professor strode up to the blackboard, looked through his notes, coughed, and began, "Guten Tag, Meine Damen und Herren" (" Good day, ladies and gentlemen").
Fowkes glanced around uneasily.
He was the only student in the course.
</p>
<p>
Toward the middle of the semester, Fowkes fell ill and missed a class.
When he returned, to Fowkes's astonishment, the professor began to deliver not the next lecture in the sequence but the one after.
Had he, in fact, lectured to an empty hall in the absence of his solitary student?
Fowkes thought it perfectly possible.
</p>
<p>
Today, American colleges and universities (originally modeled on German ones) are under strong attack.
Teachers, it is charged, are not doing a good job of teaching, and students are not doing a good job of learning.
American businesses and industries suffer from uncreative executives educated not to think for themselves but to recite obsolete ideas that the rest of the world has long discarded.
College graduates lack both basic skills and general culture.
Studies are conducted and reports are issued on the status of higher education, but any changes that result either are largely cosmetic or make a bad situation worse.
</p>
<p>
One aspect of American education too seldom challenged is the lecture system.
Professors continue to lecture and students to take notes much as they did in the thirteenth century, when books were so scarce and expensive that few students could own them.
The time is long overdue for us to abandon the lecture system and turn to methods that really work.
</p>
<p>
One problem with lectures is that listening intelligently is hard work.
Reading the same material in a textbook is a more efficient way to learn because students can proceed as slowly as they need to until the subject matter becomes clear to them.
Even simply paying attention is very difficult:
people can listen at a rate of four hundred to six hundred words a minute, while the most spirited professor talks at scarcely a third of that speed.
This time lag between speech and comprehension leads to daydreaming.
Many students believe years of watching television have shortened their attention span, but their real problem is that listening attentively is much harder than they think.
</p>
<p>
Worse still, attending lectures is passive learning, at least for inexperienced listeners.
Active learning, in which students write essays or perform experiments and then have their work evaluated by an instructor, is far more beneficial for those who have not yet fully learned how to learn.
While it's true that techniques of active listening, such as trying to anticipate the speaker's next point or taking intelligent notes, can enhance the value of a lecture, few students possess such skills at the beginning of their college careers.
More commonly, students try to write everything down and even bring tape recorders to class in a clumsy effort to capture every word.
</p>
<p>
Students need to question their professors and to have their ideas taken seriously.
Only then will they develop the analytical skills required to think intelligently and creatively.
Most students learn best by engaging in frequent and even heated debate, not by taking down a professor's often unsatisfactory summary of complicated issues.
They need small discussion classes that demand a joint effort of teacher and students rather than classes in which one person, however learned, expresses his or her own ideas.
</p>
<p>
The lecture system ultimately harms professors as well.
It reduces feedback to a minimum, so that the lecturer can neither judge how well students understand the material nor benefit from their questions or comments.
Questions that require the speaker to clarify obscure points and comments that challenge inadequately constructed arguments are indispensable to scholarship.
Without them, the liveliest mind becomes dull.
Undergraduates may not be able to make good contributions very often, but by lecturing alone a professor fails to attract the beginner's naive question that could have triggered a fruitful line of thought.
</p>
<p>
If lectures make so little sense, why have they been allowed to continue?
Administrators love them of course.
They can cram far more students into a lecture hall than into a discussion class, and for many administrators that's almost the end of the story.
But the truth is that faculty members, and even students, conspire with them to keep the lecture system alive and well.
Lectures are easier on everyone than debates.
Professors can pretend to teach by lecturing just as students can pretend to learn by attending lectures, with no one the wiser, including the participants.
Moreover, if lectures give some students an opportunity to sit back and let the professor run the show, they offer some professors an irresistible forum for showing off.
In a classroom where everyone contributes, students are less able to hide and professors have less room to show off how smart they are.
</p>
<p>
Lectures will never entirely disappear from the university scene, both because they seem to be economically necessary and because they spring from a long tradition in a setting that rightly values tradition for its own sake.
But the lectures too frequently come at the wrong end of the students' educational careers&#151;during the first two years, when they most need close, even individual, instruction.
If lecture classes were restricted to junior and senior undergraduates and to graduate students, who are more academically independent and more capable of working on their own, they would be far less destructive of students' interests and enthusiasms than the present system.
After all, students must learn to listen before they can listen to learn.
