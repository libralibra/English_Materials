<p class="storyTitle">Workin' for A Livin'</p>
<p class="storyAuthor">Robert A. Hall</p>
<p>
With hard work&#151;and a little luck&#151;you can find a job.
</p>
<p>
It's almost time for summer vacation.
That means days at the pool, movies, amusement parks and camp.
Sounds fun&#151;unless you're broke.
</p>
<p>
Let's face it&#151;without a king's income, you can't live like a king.
Which means you need a job.
But many young people lack experience and skills.
That can make it tough to find work&#151;but if you know where to look and how to act, finding a job may be easier than you think.
</p>
<p class="subTitle">
When to Begin
</p>
<p>
Start by looking at the classified ads in your local paper.
Many entry-level jobs, like fast-food worker or sales clerk will be listed there.
Check the paper every day, especially on Sundays.
</p>
<p>
But don't stop there.
The yellow pages are another good source of prospective employers.
Look for places you might want to work, like movie theaters, restaurants or shopping centers.
Visit them (dressed neatly and ready for an interview) and ask politely whether they have any openings and if you can fill out an application.
</p>
<p>
Tell everyone&#151;friends, teachers, neighbors, former employers&#151;you're looking for a job.
They may know of something, or they may keep their ears open for opportunities.
</p>
<p class="subTitle">
Make Yourself Look Good
</p>
<p>
There are always lots of job hunters filling out applications for every position.
So how do you get noticed in the crowd?
A few extra items to turn in with your application will really make you stand out.
</p>
<p>
Make a one-page r&#233;sum&#233; that lists your name, address, phone number, education and previous work experience.
Include any awards you've won and special activities you've been involved in, and don't forget special skills such as foreign language ability, typing or computer know-how.
</p>
<p>
If you've had other jobs before, get a letter of reference from your former boss that states what a good worker you are.
Or make a list of references&#151;people who can vouch for your abilities, experience and good character.
9 Former bosses, teachers, scoutmasters and clergy make good references.
Relatives don't.
Make sure your references know you're using their names&#151;and that they'll say good things about you.
</p>
<p class="subTitle">
Know Your Strengths
</p>
<p>
If an employer likes your application, he or she may call you in for an interview.
Be prepared!
</p>
<p>
Think about the kinds of questions an employer might ask you during the interview.
Some will be basic:
previous work experience, education and skills.
Others will need a little more thought.
You may be asked things like "What are your strengths?" or "Why do you want to work here?"
Practice your answers.
</p>
<p>
Dress better than you expect to dress on the job.
If you turn up looking sloppy, the interviewer may think you'll be a sloppy worker.
</p>
<p class="subTitle">
The Big Interview
</p>
<p>
You only get one chance in a job interview to make a first impression.
Make sure it's a good one.
Smile.
Be polite.
Provide detailed answers&#151;not just yes and no.
Tell the interviewer about your motivation and what you can contribute to his or her company.
</p>
<p>
If you don't get the job, thank them for their time, and inquire whether they know of any other employers who are hiring.
Ask to be contacted if they have an opening in the future.
</p>
<p>
You're in competition with lots of other job hunters, so don't be discouraged if you get turned down.
Finding a job is a job in itself&#151;and the harder you work at it, the better your chance of getting hired.
</p>
