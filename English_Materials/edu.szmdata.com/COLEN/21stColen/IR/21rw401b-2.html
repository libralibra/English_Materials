<p class="storyTitle">How to Be a Leader</p><p>
At a moment when we are waiting to see whether we have elected a President or a leader, it is worth examining the differences between the two.
For not every President is a leader, but every time we elect a President we hope for one, especially in times of doubt and crisis.
In easy times we are ambivalent&#151;the leader, after all, makes demands, challenges the status quo, shakes things up.
</p>
<p>
Leadership is as much a question of timing as anything else.
The leader must appear on the scene at a moment when people are looking for leadership, as Churchill did in 1940, as Roosevelt did in 1933, as Lenin did in 1917.
And when he comes, he must offer a simple, eloquent message.
</p>
<p>
Great leaders are almost always great simplifiers, who cut through argument, debate and doubt to offer a solution everybody can understand and remember.
Churchill warned the British to expect "blood, toil, tears and sweat";
FDR told Americans that "the only thing we have to fear is fear itself";
Lenin promised the war-weary Russians peace, land and bread.
Straightforward but potent messages.
</p>
<p>
It also helps for a leader to be able to do something most of us can't:
FDR overcame polio;
Mao swam the Yangtze River at the age of 72.
We don't want our leaders to be "just like us."
We want them to be like us but better, special, more so.
Yet if they are too different, we reject them.
Adiai Stevenson was too cerebral.
Nelson Rockefeller, too rich.
</p>
<p>
A leader must know how to use power (that's what leadership is about) but he also has to have a way of showing that he does.
He has to be able to project firmness&#151;no physical clumsiness (like Ford), no rapid eye movement (like Carter).
</p>
<p>
A Chinese philosopher once remarked that a leader must have the grace of a good dancer, and there is a great deal of wisdom to this.
A leader should know how to appear relaxed and confident.
His walk should be firm and purposeful.
He should be able, like Lincoln, FDR, Truman, Ike and JFK, to give a good, hearty, belly laugh, instead of the sickly grin that passes for good humor in Nixon or Carter.
Ronald Reagan's training as an actor showed to good effect in the debate with Carter, when by his easy manner and apparent affability, he managed to convey the impression that in fact he was the President and Carter the challenger.
</p>
<p>
If we know what we're looking for, why is it so difficult to find?
The answer lies in a very simple truth about leadership.
People can only be led where they want to go.
The leader follows, though a step ahead.
Americans wanted to climb out of the Depression and needed someone to tell them they could do it, and FDR did.
The British believed that they could still win the war after the defeats of 1940, and Churchill told them they were right.
</p>
<p>
A leader rides the waves, moves with the tides, understands the deepest desires of his people.
He cannot make a nation that wants peace at any price go to war, or stop a nation determined to fight from doing so.
His purpose must match the national mood.
His task is to focus the people's energies and desires, to define them in simple terms, to inspire, to make what people already want seem attainable, important, within their grasp.
</p>
<p>
Above all, he must dignify our desires, convince us that we are taking part in the making of great history, give us a sense of glory about ourselves.
Winston Churchill managed, by sheer rhetoric, to turn the British defeat and the evacuation of Dunkirk in 1940 into a major victory.
FDR's words turned the sinking of the American fleet at Pearl Harbor into a national rallying cry instead of a humiliating national scandal.
A leader must stir our blood, not appeal to our reason.
</p>
<p>
For this reason, businessmen generally make poor leaders.
They tend to be pragmatists who think that once you've explained why something makes sense, people will do it.
But history shows the fallacy of this belief.
When times get tough, people don't want to be told what went wrong, or lectured, or given a lot of complicated statistics and plans (like Carter's energy policy) they don't understand.
They want to be moved, excited, inspired, consoled, uplifted&#151;in short, led!
</p>
<p>
A great leader must have a certain irrational quality, a stubborn refusal to face facts, infectious optimism, the ability to convince us that all is not lost even when we're afraid it is.
Confucius suggested that, while the advisers of a great leader should be as cold as ice, the leader himself should have fire, a spark of divine madness.
</p>
<p>
He won't come until we're ready for him, for the leader is like a mirror, reflecting back to us our own sense of purpose, putting into words our own dreams and hopes, transforming our needs and fears into coherent policies and programs.
</p>
<p>
Our strength makes him strong;
our determination makes him determined;
our courage makes him a hero;
he is, in the final analysis, the symbol of the best in us, shaped by our own spirit and will.
And when these qualities are lacking in us, we can't produce him;
and even with all our skill at image building, we can't fake him.
He is, after all, merely the sum of us.
</p>
