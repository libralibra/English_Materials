To understand the differences between extrinsic and intrinsic motivation, imagine a business problem as a maze.
</p>
<p>
One person might be motivated to make it through the maze as quickly and safely as possible in order to get a tangible reward, such as money&#151;the same way a mouse would rush through for a piece of cheese.
This person would look for the simplest, most straightforward path and then take it.
In fact, if he is in a real rush to get that reward, he might just take the most beaten path and solve the problem exactly as it has been solved before.
</p>
<p>
Another person might have a different approach to the maze.
She might actually find the process of wandering around the different paths&#151;the challenge and exploration itself&#151;fun and intriguing.
No doubt, this journey will take longer and include mistakes, because any maze&#151;any truly complex problem&#151;has many more dead ends than exits.
But when the intrinsically motivated person finally does find a way out of the maze&#151;a solution&#151;it very likely will be more interesting.
</p>
<p>
There is abundant evidence of strong intrinsic motivation in the stories of widely recognized creative people.
When asked what makes the difference between creative scientists and those who are less creative, the Nobel-prize-winning physicist Arthur Schawlow said, "The most successful scientists often are not the most talented, but the ones who are just impelled by curiosity.
They've got to know what the answer is."
Albert Einstein talked about intrinsic motivation as "the enjoyment of seeing and searching."
The novelist John Irving, in discussing the very long hours he put into his writing, said.
"The unspoken factor is love.
The reason I can work so hard at my writing is that it's not work for me."
And Michael Jordan, perhaps the most creative basketball player ever, had a "love of the game" clause inserted into his contract;
he insisted that he be free to play pick-up basketball games any time he wished.
</p>
<p>
Creative people are rarely superstars like Michael Jordan.
Indeed, most of the creative work done in the business world today gets done by people whose names will never be recorded in history books.
They are people with expertise, good creative-thinking skills, and high levels of intrinsic motivation.
