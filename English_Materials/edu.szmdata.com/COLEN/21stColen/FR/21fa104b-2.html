<p>
Once upon a time there was a wise man that used to go to the ocean to do his writing.
He had a habit of walking on the beach before he began his work.
</p>
<p>
One day he was walking along the shore.
As he looked down the beach, he saw a human figure moving like a dancer.
He smiled to himself at the thought of someone who would dance on the beach.
So he began to walk faster to catch up.
</p>
<p>
As he got closer, he saw that it was a young man and the young man wasn't dancing, but instead he was reaching down to the shore, picking up something and very gently throwing it into the ocean.
</p>
<p>
As he got closer he called out, "Good morning!
What are you doing?"
</p>
<p>
The young man paused, looked up and replied, "Throwing starfish in the ocean."
</p>
<p>
"I guess I should have asked, why are you throwing starfish in the ocean?"
</p>
<p>
"The sun is up and the tide is going out.
And if I don't throw them in they'll die."
</p>
<p>
"But, young man, don't you realize that there are miles and miles of beach and starfish all along it.
You can't possibly make a difference!"
</p>
<p>
The young man listened politely.
Then he bent down, picked another starfish and threw it into the sea, past the breaking waves and said, "It made a difference for that one.
</p>
<p>
There is something very special in each and every one of us.
We have all been gifted with the ability to make a difference.
And if we can become aware of that gift, we will gain through the strength of our visions the power to shape the future.
</p>
<p>
We must each find our starfish.
And if we throw our starfish wisely and well, the world will be blessed.
</p>
