<p class="storyTitle">Positive Self-Images and Your Success</p><p>
Do you have a self image that can help you succeed or one that can make you fail?
Let's discover what self-image is all about.
Get a picture in your mind of two empty chairs.
In these two chairs let's picture two visitors.
In the first chair let's seat a young man who is deaf.
In the second chair let's seat a young boy who was born with part of one foot missing.
</p>
<p>
The young man we picked for the first chair was a musician.
He was a great artist.
He composed many great songs and symphonies.
When he was still a young man he lost his hearing.
It is generally believed that a person cannot be a professional musician or compose music without hearing, but this man had a special driving force that enabled him to write some of the most beautiful music ever written.
This man was Beethoven.
</p>
<p>
The visitor in the second chair was a young boy who was born with part of one foot missing.
This young boy loved sports, especially football.
As a young boy and later as a young man he had always dreamed of playing football with a major league football team.
He had a thirst that could not be quenched.
Finally, he made it into the New Orleans Saints football team and one day on the football field in New Orleans he kicked the longest field goal in football history.
His name is Tom Dempsey.
</p>
<p>
If you try to find the special strength that turns an ordinary person into a hero it only exists in the heart or soul of man.
It is called a positive self-image.
A positive self-image is a great belief in yourself and your ideas.
