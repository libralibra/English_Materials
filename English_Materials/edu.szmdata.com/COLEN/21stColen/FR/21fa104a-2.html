The idea of respect comes from the concept that everyone, including yourself, has self-worth, and therefore should be treated with dignity.
Say, for example, that you're having a discussion with your boyfriend or girlfriend and your opinions are different.
While you may disagree with each other, each of you still has a right to your own feelings.
You can show each other respect by sticking to your own values or beliefs while agreeing to disagree.
Calling someone names or making fun of them because they think, act, or look differently deprives them of their dignity, and is disrespectful.
It is important to treat others fairly and with respect, just as you would want to be treated yourself.

<p>
Can you think of times when someone has or hasn't shown you respect?
How did it feel?
What could that person have done differently?
</p>
<p>
Each person in a relationship has a level of responsibility.
This means that if you've committed yourself to something, it's up to you to carry it out and see it through.
This can include anything from saying you'll call someone at a certain time and then calling that person, to deciding what you would do if you or your girlfriend had to make an important decision.
What does responsibility mean to you?
Have there been times when someone you know committed to something and then didn't follow through?
How did that make you feel?
</p>
<p>
Whenever you think about responsibility, it's a good idea to keep respect in the back of your mind&#151;and vice versa.
There are respectful ways of handling responsibilities, and there are disrespectful ways.
And no matter what happens, we must all answer for our own actions.
The best relationships are developed when people respect one another and take responsibility for themselves and for their role in the relationship.
