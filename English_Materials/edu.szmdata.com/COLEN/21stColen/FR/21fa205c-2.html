You will find that college classes are very different from high school classes.
You will have more work and responsibilities without being pushed as much.
On the other hand, you will have more freedom&#151;freedom to choose what to study, when to study, or whether to study.
You will need to exercise maximum self-discipline.
This is the hardest kind of discipline because it is self-imposed, and you have only yourself to answer to.
The decisions you make concerning your study habits will be a determining factor in your success, or lack of success in college.
</p>
<p>
In addition, you will discover that your instructors differ from the ones you have had previously.
They will expect you to take more initiative in your study habits and time management.
Remember that much of your learning takes place outside the classroom.
Your instructor will give you additional help outside of class if there is evidence that you are putting maximum effort into the course.
</p>
<p>
In this book you will find suggestions and techniques to help you better organize your time and study habits, as well as resources to help you make the most of your college opportunities.
There is no plan or technique that could be labeled as the best and be guaranteed to fit each individual.
Learning is a very personal matter and cannot be totally standardized.
Therefore, you should study each plan and technique available and then choose the one that seems right for you.
</p>
<p>
Success in anything will not just happen.
Regardless of your abilities and skill mastery, you will need to manage your time effectively in order to succeed in college.
A schedule based on efficient use of time will enable you to include both work and play.
When you get a job, you will soon discover that you do not work only when you wish and as you wish.
If fact, you will have an organized plan for as long as you remain in school and organize your activities as if going to school is a business.
