The atmosphere is owned by no nation, but in a sense it belongs to all nations.
Several types of human activity interact with geophysical processes to affect the atmosphere in ways that bring about crisis situations.
The most obvious example of local effects is urban air pollution resulting from automobile emissions, home heating and cooling, and industrial processes.
The Denver "brown cloud" is a case in point, as is the extreme pollution in Mexico City. Such pollution can occur within one city or state or across state, provincial, or international borders.
Air pollution is one of those problems to which almost everyone in the urban area contributes.

Acid ram is an example of the pollution of a regional atmospheric commons.
Industrial processes release pollutants, which can then interact with the atmosphere and be washed out by rainfall.
Acid rain has caused the health of forest ecosystems to deteriorate in such locations as the northeastern part of North America, central Europe, and Scandinavia.
The trajectories of airborne industrial pollutants moving from highly industrialized areas across these regions have been studied.
The data tend to support the contention that while acid rain is a regional commons problem, it is also a problem of global interest.

A nation can put any chemical effluents it deems necessary for its well-being into its own airspace.
But then the atmosphere's fluid motion can move those effluents across international borders.
The purpose of the tall smokestack, for example, was to put effluents higher into the air, so they would be carried away and dispersed farther from their source.
The tall stacks, in essence, turned local air pollution problems into regional ones.
In many instances, they converted national pollution into an international problem.
