Teaching involves more than leadership.
Some of the teacher's time and effort is directed toward instruction, some toward evaluation.
But it is the teacher as a group leader who creates an efficient organizational structure and good working environment so that instruction and evaluation activities can take place.
A group that is totally disorganized, unclear about its goals, or constantly fighting among its members will not be a good learning group.
The leadership pattern includes helping to form and maintain a positive learning environment so that instruction and evaluation activities can take place.
</p>
<p>
On the first day of class, the teacher faces a room filled with individuals.
Perhaps a few closely united groups and friendships already exist.
But there is no sense of group unity, no set of rules for conduct in the group, no feeling of belonging.
If teachers are successful leaders, they will help students develop a system of relationships that encourages cooperation.
</p>
<p>
Standards and rules must be established that maintain order, ensure justice, and protect individual rights, but do not contradict school policy.
What happens when one student hurts another's individual rights?
Without clear guidelines mutually agreeable to students, teachers, and administration, the classroom can become chaotic.
Students may break rules they did not know existed.
If standards are set without input from the class, students may spend a great deal of creative energy in ruining the class environment, finding ways to break rules.
</p>
<p>
No matter how skillful the teacher is in uniting students and establishing a positive atmosphere, the task is never complete.
Regular maintenance is necessary.
Conflicts arise.
The needs of individual members change.
A new kind of learning task requires a new organizational structure.
Sometimes outside pressures such as holidays, upcoming tests or athletic contests, or family troubles cause stress in the classroom.
One task for the teacher is to restore a positive environment by helping students cope with conflict, change, and stress.
