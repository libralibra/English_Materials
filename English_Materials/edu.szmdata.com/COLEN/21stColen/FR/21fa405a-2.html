<p>
You'd think Pauline Hord would have served her time by now.
</p>
<p>
After all, she recently celebrated her 90th birthday, and by the time she achieved that breathtaking milestone, she'd already done a 10-year stretch in the Mississippi State Prison.
</p>
<p>
Ms. Hord is a sweet-natured, gentle-talking, white-haired Southerner who never owed a debt to society&#151;thus, she never had to pay one.
</p>
<p>
So you have to wonder what a woman like this is doing in a place where most people are itching to get loose.
</p>
<p>
Unlike the rest of the population, Ms. Hord goes to prison freely and eagerly.
</p>
<p>
And when she gets there, she coaxes prisoners of every stripe to sing little ditties about their ABCs and XYZs.
</p>
<p>
At age 80, Ms. Hord began teaching convicts to read during a chance visit to the State Prison with a lawyer friend.
</p>
<p>
"When I got there, I heard that a group of volunteer workers had been praying for a teacher.
They asked me if I would come and I said I would be thrilled," she says.
</p>
<p>
"We don't preach," she says.
</p>
<p>
But on a personal level, Ms. Hord considers this rewarding work.
</p>
<p>
"If you get at the reason why these men went into crime, you find that none of them succeeded in their early years of schooling.
</p>
<p>
"They went to school at 5 believing they were going to learn to read.
When they didn't learn in the first or second grade, they realized something was wrong.
</p>
<p>
"By 8, they were having problems.
By 12 or 13, they were drinking or using drugs.
</p>
<p>
"And it's getting worse.
I'm seeing younger and younger prisoners who know less and less.
They can't read well enough to function in this society."
</p>
<p>
It is this situation that Ms. Hord goes to prison week after week to correct.
</p>
<p>
And when her most difficult students finally begin to read, she is sure that she, too, knows why the caged birds sing.
</p>
