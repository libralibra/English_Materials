Every Chinese schoolchild is drilled in the motherland's historic "Four Inventions":
gunpowder, paper, printing and the compass.
But last week a somewhat unlikely item was added to the list of things for which the rest of the world should apparently be grateful to China&#151;the sauna.
</p>
<p>
According to China Daily, the sauna "may well have once been a popular luxury in ancient China", and "related records on steam bathing by ancient Chinese may be found in various historical accounts".
</p>
<p>
It seems that nothing was beyond the ancient Chinese.
A couple of years ago, an article claimed that China had also invented golf, which was news to Scotland.
And in the recent Peking Toilet Exhibition, photographs of archaeological remains were produced to demonstrate that China was home to the earliest known public convenience.

Finland, which has a million saunas for its population of five million, is likely to be devastated by this latest revelation.
According to China Daily, during the Warring States period (475B.C.&#151;221B.C.), Shi Hu, the King of Zhao of the Jie ethnic group, used to bathe in the steam from a pool into which more than 1,000 scalding metal bars, each weighing just over 40lb, had been plunged.
</p>
<p>
As for Kubla Khan, "struck down by a disabling illness" one day after fighting, "his attendants poured water on a scorching hot stone to make steam" which helped him to expel a blood clot, explained the newspaper.
</p>
<p>
"It is possible that the Chinese style of steaming or fuming found its way to Finland and was eventually accepted by the Finns," said China Daily, suggesting that the Chinese invention could have spread to Finland when the Hun people, who originated in China, invaded Hungary in AD 376.
However, a Finnish spokesman argued that saunas in Finland dated back to the Stone Age and there was much more to the sauna than just a bit of steam.
The fundamentals of the sauna experience included "forests, lakes, clean air and fresh water", he said.
