Keeping out of trouble in marriage by staying quiet is an excellent piece of advice.
For example, don't say to your wife, "You forgot to salt the food."
You can quietly salt it yourself, as you will not be gaining anything by criticizing your wife.
Don't say, "You are always going to your parents, instead of being at home."
Instead, if it bothers you, do something interesting with your wife, so that she will want to stay home.
</p>
<p>
A wife can also cause damage by saying things thoughtlessly.
For example, if she says, "Can you stop reading the newspaper and speak to me?" it hurts her husband.
Instead, she can get his attention by showing him some affection or telling him something that will interest him.
Saying to her husband, "Why do you always leave such a mess after yourself?" only breeds resentment and makes matters worse.
Instead of that, she can say, "It would be so great if you would help me by organizing your stuff after you finish."
If he has a habit that he cannot change, it is better not to mention it at all, but to learn to live with it, since every word will only aggravate the problem more.

Most arguments in marriage occur when one spouse expresses a negative opinion of the other.
Do not forget that anything you say is well-remembered by your spouse and can cause great damage to your marriage.
It is not possible to take back the sting of hurtful words once they have been said;
therefore it is much wiser not to say them in the first place.
</p>
<p>
It is always right to praise your spouse.
Try to find something nice to say every day.
Such words strengthen the bond between a couple, since they show that you care for one another.
</p>
<p>
Saying the right words to your spouse is very important.
You very seldom go wrong if you think carefully before you speak.
