Each college evaluates applicants differently.
It is important to be aware of these differences and to create a strategy that is specific to each college.
Some schools look only at academics and test scores, while others will consider alumni relations, state residency, interviews and other criteria.
It is crucial to understand what each school deems important.
</p>
<p>
This information will allow you to focus on what will really help you to get into that particular school.
</p>
<p>
Some schools will choose a percentage of their students based solely on academic considerations.
UC Berkeley chooses up to about 50 % of their applicants this way.
For most students, however, it is the other factors which will get them accepted or rejected.
</p>
<p>
The College-Edge strategy can help you figure out why the school of your choice may accept or deny your admissions.
The Overall Plan will show you how important different factors are at different schools, such as test scores, minority status, and talents.
This can give you an idea of how your strengths and weaknesses will affect your admission.
You can also then compare your scores and skills with those of the freshman class of that college.
</p>
<p>
Are you well-rounded?
</p>
<p>
Usually, after the admissions officers examine the academic criteria, they will examine the character of the student through his or her achievements and activities.
More than just a "well-rounded" person, most colleges are looking for people who will make a contribution in some way to their schools and who have proven themselves to be motivated leaders.
</p>
<p>
If you have studied your way through high school without doing much else, chances are your application will seem a little incomplete.
On the other hand, if you were involved in a million activities, but contributed nothing, your application may seem a little shallow.
Schools may deny a student admission based on these grounds.
</p>
<p>
For instance, Yale University insists they have more interest in performance rather than test scores.
Yale says it wants someone who will be a curious and involved student, and choose accordingly.
Schools may overlook a bad test score if there are other strong points in an application, but a good test won't cover up deficiencies in other areas.
