<p>
Last July, my 12-year-old car died on California's Santa Ana Freeway.
It was an hour before sunset, and I was 25 miles from home.
I couldn't reach anyone to pick me up, so I decided to take a bus.
Not knowing the routes, I figured I'd just head east.
</p>
<p>
A bus pulled up, and I asked the driver how far she was going.
"Four more lights," she said.
There was another bus I could take from there.
This clearly was going to be a long night.
</p>
<p>
She dropped me off at the end of her route and told me which bus to look for.
After waiting 30 minutes, I began to think about a very expensive cab ride home.
Then a bus pulled up.
There was no lighted number above its windshield.
It was out of service.
But the door opened, and darned if it wasn't the same driver.
</p>
<p>
"I just can't leave you here," she said.
"This isn't the nicest place.
I'll give you a ride home."
</p>
<p>
"You'll drive me home in the bus?"
I asked, perplexed.
</p>
<p>
"No, I'll take you in my car," she said.
</p>
<p>
"It's a long way," I protested.
</p>
<p>
"Come on," she said.
"I have nothing else to do."
</p>
<p>
As we drove from the depot in her car, she began telling me a story.
A few days earlier, her brother had run out of gas.
A good Samaritan picked him up, took him to a service station and then back to his car.
"I'm just passing the favor along," she said.
</p>
<p>
When I offered her money as a thank-you, she wouldn't hear of it.
"That wouldn't make it a favor," she said.
"Just do something nice for somebody.
Pass it along."
</p>
