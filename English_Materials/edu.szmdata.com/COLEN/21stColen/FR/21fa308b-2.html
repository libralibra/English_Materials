The ideal companion machine would not only look, feel, and sound friendly but would also be programmed to behave in a congenial manner.
Those qualities that make interaction with other people enjoyable would be stimulated as closely as possible and the machines would appear to be charming, stimulating, and easy-going.
Its informal conversational style would make interaction comfortable, and yet the machine would remain slightly unpredictable and therefore interesting.
In its first encounter it might be somewhat hesitant and unassuming, but as it came to know the user it would progress to a more relaxed and intimate style.
The machine would not be a passive participant but would add its own suggestions, information and opinions;
it would sometimes take the initiative in developing or changing the topic and would have a personality of its own.

The machine would convey presence.
We have all seen how a computer's use of personal names and of typically human phrasing often fascinates the beginning user and leads people to treat the machine as if it were almost human.
Such features are easily written into the software, and by introducing a degree of forcefulness and humor, the machine could be presented as a vivid and unique character.

Friendship is not made in a day, and the computer would be more acceptable as a friend if it stimulated the gradual changes that occur when one person is getting to know another.
At an appropriate time it might also express the kind of affection that stimulates attachment and intimacy.
The whole process would be accomplished with subtlety to avoid giving an impression of over-familiarity that would be likely to produce irritation.
After experiencing a wealth of powerful, well-timed friendship indications, the user would be very likely to accept the computer as far more than a machine and might well come to regard it as a friendship.
