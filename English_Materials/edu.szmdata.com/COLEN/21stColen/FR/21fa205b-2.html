Among my experiences as a college president is the all-too-frequent phone call in the night that begins:
"One of your students is in the emergency room with alcohol poisoning."
The whole country got a similar wake-up call in June when it was reported that alcohol abuse on college campuses is on the rise, especially for women, and that college students drink far more than nonstudents.
One statistic showed that college students spend more money on alcohol while in college than on books.
Alcohol abuse, although tragic, is but one symptom of a larger campus crisis.
A generation has come to college quite fragile, not very secure about who it is, fearful of its lack of identity and without confidence in its future.
Many students are ashamed of themselves and afraid of relationships.
</p>
<p>
Students use alcohol as an escape.
It's used as an excuse for bad behavior:
the insanity defense writ large on campus.
This diminished sense of self has caused a growth in racism, sexism, attempted suicide, theft, property-damage and cheating on most campuses.
</p>
<p>
This is not the stuff of most presidents' public conversations.
Nor can it be explained away as an "underclass" problem;
it is found on our most privileged campuses.
It is happening because the generation now entering college has experienced few authentic connections with adults in its lifetime.
I call this the "Culture of Neglect," and we&#151;parents, teachers, professors and administrators&#151;are the primary architects.
</p>
<p>
It begins at home, where social and economic factors&#151;such as declining incomes requiring longer work hours&#151;result in less family time.
Young people have been allowed to or must take part-time jobs rather than spending time in school, on homework or with their families.
More children and youths are being reared in a vacuum, with television as their only supervisor, and there is little expectation that they learn personal responsibility.
Immersed in themselves, they are left to their peers.
