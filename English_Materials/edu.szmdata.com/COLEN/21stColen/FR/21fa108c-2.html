At one time, I was convinced that real learning would be at hand if every child had a computer.
I was convinced that computers would revolutionize education and hold immense possibilities for learning.
</p>
<p>
That possibility has not become a reality yet.
Based on recent test results, far too many Californian children have not mastered the basic reading, math, and writing skills necessary to function at a minimal level in our society.
And far too many children do not have the commitment to concentrate on learning to get a good education.
These kids need good teachers, not fast computers.
</p>
<p>
No one will argue that computers have educational uses.
Unfortunately, in far too many instances, the classroom computer has replaced the television set as a game tool to occupy children.
One wonders what is the use of an Internet feed to the classroom if the child does not read.
</p>
<p>
There are those who believe that bringing a computer to the classroom will supplement what teachers teach.
That is difficult to comprehend since teachers are always telling us how many subjects and how little time they have to teach.
When a child is occupied with a computer for any length of time, that child does not get the attention of teachers and the required learning that should occupy their class time.
</p>
<p>
Educators are now looking into requiring teachers and students to become computer proficient.
And districts that do not have enough dollars for textbooks are spending their meager funds to buy computers and software, all in the name of technology and computer competency.
</p>
<p>
One would think that educators would come to the realization that computers are tools not much different from libraries, calculators, movie or slide projectors.
Kids must still learn and be inspired to study basic skills, think, write, communicate, solve problems, and be good citizens.
</p>
<p>
And while it is good for students to make use of computers, we must not get carried away with faster and more powerful computers at the expense of basic skills, effective teaching and powerful learning.
