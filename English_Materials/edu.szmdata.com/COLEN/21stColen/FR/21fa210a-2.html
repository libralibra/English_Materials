Partnerships with corporations and businesses will become a greater part of university involvement.
The 21st century will see expansion of partnerships of this type particularly with research universities.
These will take on different forms.
They will involve collaboration for education of an older workforce, collaboration for organizational and process improvement in both types of organizations, agreements for special considerations in student recruitment and internships, and employment and funding between the partners.
Each will need to undergo some modification of culture as these changes occur.

The convener role involves bringing people to campus to address certain important issues.
It means identifying experts around the world to join with those on campus to seek understanding and actions for change.
This conference sponsored by Peking University is an example of the convener function, and it also involves bringing people together to learn about modem approaches to the latest and most important issues in many different fields.
This role has been served for many years in agriculture, education and engineering.
Others are emerging, and the future will have universities serving an even broader role as convener of experts in many different parts.
</p>
<p>
The world role for universities is another that is evolving rapidly.
It is being driven by increasing ease of communication world wide, the connectivity of economies of countries around the world, the opening up of greater opportunities for trade, and the increasing prevalence of multinational corporations.
