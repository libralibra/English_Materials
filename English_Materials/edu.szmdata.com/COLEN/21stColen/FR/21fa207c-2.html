The benefits of listening are seen in the "orienting reflex," discovered by Pavlov.
When a dog hears a sound or sees movement, it will stop all activities and cock its head.
Another Russian scientist, E. N. Sokolov, noticed that the dog's heart rate slows.
</p>
<p>
A similar response occurs in people too&#151;and it lowers blood pressure.
One experiment charted human pressure during three activities:
reading out loud, staring at a blank wall and watching fish in a tank.
Blood pressure was highest when the people spoke.
But it was lowest when they watched the fish, rather than when they simply sat and relaxed.
Whether watching fish or listening to another person, attending calmly to the world outside yourself helps lower blood pressure.
When I got hypertensives to listen undefensively, their blood pressure often fell dramatically.
</p>
<p>
Why do some people find talking so stressful, and listening so difficult?
I tested some healthy newborns.
When they cried, their blood pressure often doubled.
We began thinking about pressure surges in hypertensives as similar to the changes when a baby cries.
Though calm on the surface while talking, their bodies are screaming to be heard.
For these people, communication becomes a desperate but hidden struggle.
Inside their adult bodies is a baby crying, terrified because no one can hear it.
</p>
<p>
Status can compound the communication problem.
Many patients told us their pressure was always lower when they took it at home than when their doctors took it.
Could the doctor's high social status be a factor?
To test the idea, we recruited 40 medical students, and had their blood pressure taken while they were quiet, and while speaking.
For half the students, our researcher dressed in blue jeans and said he was a graduate student.
With the other half, he wore a white lab coat and said he was an internist.
Those who spoke to the "doctor" registered higher blood pressure readings.
