Anna Creal, 44, an office manager, and Stephen Creal, 55, a dentist, found their marriage flounder over Stephen's inability to keep his promises.

Cool Off. When emotions are raw, Lonnie Barbach, co-author of Going the Distance:
Finding and Keeping Lifelong Love, recommends therapy.
"It's helpful to have a therapist's objective point of view because, typically, each person just sees what the other person is doing, not how he or she is contributing to the problem."

Therapy needn't take a big commitment of money and time.
Many churches and community mental-health centers offer free counseling or support groups.
And many therapists practice something called solution-oriented brief therapy, which focuses on problem solving and can take only a few sessions.
