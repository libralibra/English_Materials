<p>
A new science and engineering undergraduate program at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) is helping prepare students to become leaders capable of imagining and directing change in local, national, and global communities.
</p>
<p>
Three years ago, MIT cooperated with Leadership, Inc. to create the campus-based LeaderShape Institute.
Program leaders call it "a thoughtful and creative response to today's fundamental challenges" to develop students and engineers who are prepared to "lead with integrity" both in technological fields and in society.
Central to the effort is helping students to learn to listen to society as it articulates its need for change.
</p>
<p>
For the past three summers, the LeaderShape Institute has provided 120 MIT science and engineering students with an intensive six-day experience featuring highly interactive teaching and learning methodologies Throughout the program, students develop skills in problem identification and problem solving, professional ethics, decision making, dealing with uncertainty, working within a diverse community, and interpersonal communication.
Most discussions and activities take place in assigned small "clusters," which provide supportive, safe environments that promote learning and develop new skills and attitudes.
Each participant creates an individual plan of action called "vision," which is a main feature of the LeaderShape curriculum.
Each vision must be designed to bring positive change to the campus community, and it must be carried out during the following academic year.
