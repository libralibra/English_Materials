When we have difficulty expressing our feelings or emotions, we are in effect, suppressing them.
This blocks the natural flow of our life-force energy, which sustains our feelings of connection with Spirit, Higher self and others.
When we block our energy, this allows our fear to creep into our conscious awareness.
We feel alone, separate, disconnected or maybe, just plain "lost!"
We, then, experience a great sense of separation and, the more we focus on the sense of separation and the feelings of loss, the more the feelings of fear and pain intensify within us.
And the more we focus on our fear and pain, the more separate and alone we feel, the more disconnected from ourselves, others and Spirit.
Each one is perpetuating the other.
It is a downward spiral!
</p>
<p>
No one wants to feel separate or alone.
Feeling alone and disconnected only creates more feelings of loneliness or loss.
Suppressing our emotions&#151;intentionally&#151;quickly takes us there.
It's important to know we only need to remember that every feeling and emotion we have, both negative and positive, are all natural emotions.
They just need to be accepted and expressed!
The key is, though, we must learn to express our negative emotions (like anger) in ways that do not harm anyone physically and I or emotionally.
</p>
<p>
You were taught well!
</p>
<p>
Can you remember a time when you or someone else experienced anger being expressed without anyone being hurt in the process&#151;either emotionally and I or physically?
Probably not!
Most of us experienced just the opposite and someone did get hurt!
That hurt may have also translated into loss.
Someone got so angry that they left.
How does that effect us today?
Do you live your life afraid that if you get "too" angry, he or she will leave?
Is your suppressed anger leaking out in unconscious, hurtful ways like sarcasm, physical illness, depression or addictions?
