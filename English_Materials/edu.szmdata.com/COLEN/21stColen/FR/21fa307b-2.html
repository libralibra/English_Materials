Apparently, many people believe that the more time a person spends at work, the more she or he accomplishes.
However, the connection between time and productivity is not always positive.
In fact, many studies indicate that after a certain point, anyone's productivity and creativity begin to decrease.
Furthermore, it's not always easy for individuals to realize that their performance is falling off.
</p>
<p>
Part of the problem is understandable.
When employers evaluate employees, they often consider the amount of time on the job in addition to job performance.
Employees know this.
Consequently, they work longer hours and take less vacation time than they did nine years ago.
Although many working people can do their job effectively during a regular 40-hour work week, they feel they have to spend more time on the job after normal working hours so that the people who can promote them see them.

<p>
A group of headhunters (people who search out executive personnel for companies) were asked their opinions about a situation.
They had a choice of two candidates for an executive position with an important company.
The candidates had comparable qualifications for the job.
For example, they were both reliable.
One could do the job well in a 40-hour work week.
The other would do the same job in an 80-hour week just as well.
According to a headhunting expert, the 80-hour-a-week candidate would get the job.
The time this candidate spends on the job may encourage other employees to spend more time at work, too.
Employers believe that if the employees stay at work later, they may actually do more work.
</p>
<p>
People do not work long hours only for money.
In such fields as advertising, show business, and journalism, the glamour and publicity are worth more than any monetary benefit.
On the other hand, many employees are not willing to spend so much extra unproductive time at the office.
Once they finish their work satisfactorily, they want to relax and enjoy themselves.
For these people, the solution is to find a company that encourages people to do both.
