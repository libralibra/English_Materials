<p class="storyTitle">The Hours for Study</p><p>
Research shows that the average high school student will study four hours per week for any major test.
The outcome of this four hours of study varies from an A to an F, which means that in high school grades are strongly determined by intelligence since everyone studies the same amount of time.
</p>
<p>
But college is different.
Most of the students are highly intelligent and each has plenty of time for self-study.
To score high on any test, a college student has to work hard and, probably more importantly, know how to use his or her time most efficiently.
The problem is that your study habits formed in high school may make you unable to study well in college because you have never experienced what it takes to perform at the college level.
That is why the freshman year is the hardest year for all college students.
</p>
<p>
Based on my extensive observation of student performances on college tests, I recommend the following study time per test:
6 hours per week for an A, 4 hours for a B, 3.5 hours for a C, 2.5 hours for a D and 0 hours for an F. An hour of study is defined as studying for 45 minutes and a break of 15 minutes.
Ten hours of continuous study without a break is defined as one hour of study.
The brain does not process and store information the way students prefer studying.
Occasionally, some succeed by studying at the last minute, but they are exceptions to the rule.
</p>
<p>
Research also suggests that the 10 percent of the students may need 5 to 6 times as much time to learn the same material as the fastest 10 percent.
Each person is very likely to have strengths and weaknesses.
Overcoming your weakness increases your strength.
