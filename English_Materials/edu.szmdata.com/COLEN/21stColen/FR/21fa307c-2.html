Many intelligent people still equate happiness with fun.
The truth is that fun and happiness have little or nothing in common.
Fun is what we experience during the act.
Happiness is what we experience after an act.
It is a deeper, more abiding emotion.
</p>
<p>
Going to an amusement park or ball game, watching a movie or television, are fun activities that help us relax, temporarily forget our problems and maybe even laugh.
But they do not bring happiness, because their positive effects end when the fun ends.
</p>
<p>
I have often thought that if Hollywood stars have a role to play, it is to teach us that happiness has nothing to do with fun.
These rich, beautiful individuals have constant access to glamorous parties, fancy cars, expensive homes, everything that spells "happiness".
But in memoir after memoir, celebrities reveal unhappiness hidden beneath all their fun:
depression, alcoholism, drug addiction, broken marriage, troubled children, profound loneliness.
</p>
<p>
Yet people continue to believe that the next, more glamorous party, more expensive car, more luxurious vacation, fancier home will do what all the other parties, cars, vacations, homes have not been able to do.
</p>
<p>
The way people cling to the belief that a fun-filled, pain-free life equals happiness actually diminishes their chances of ever attaining real happiness.
If fun and pleasure are equated with happiness, then pain must be equated with unhappiness.
But in fact, the opposite is true:
more times than not, things that lead to happiness involve some pain.
</p>
<p>
As a result, many people avoid the very endeavors that are the source of true happiness.
They fear the pain inevitably brought by such things as marriage, raising children, professional achievement, religious commitment, civic or charitable work, self-improvement.
</p>
<p>
Ask a bachelor why he resists marriage even though he finds dating to be less and less satisfying.
If he's honest, he will tell you that he is afraid of making a commitment.
For commitment is in fact quite painful.
The single life is filled with fun, adventure, excitement.
Marriage has such moments, but they are not its most distinguished features.
</p>
<p>
Similarly, couples who choose not to have children are deciding in favor of painless fun over painful happiness.
They can dine out whenever they want and sleep as late as they want.
Couples with infant children are lucky to get a whole night's sleep or a three-day vacation.
I don't know any parents would choose the word fun to describe raising children.
But couples who decide not to have children never experience the pleasure of hugging or tucking them into bed at night.
They never know the joy of watching a child grow up or of playing with a grandchild.
