The word "recreation" brings to mind activities that are relaxing and enjoyable.
Such activities as an evening talk around the neighborhood, a Sunday picnic with the family, and playing catch in the yard with the children seem relatively spontaneous and relaxing.
</p>
<p>
Much American recreational activity, however, seems to foreign visitors to be approached with a high degree of seriousness, planning, organization, and expense.
Spontaneity and the fund are absent, as far as the visitor can tell.
"These crazy Americans!" a south American exclaimed on seeing yet another jogger go past her house in subfreezing winter weather.
Many Americans jog every day, or play tennis, handball, racquetball, or bridge two or three times a week, or bowl every Thursday night, or have some other regularly scheduled recreation.
They go on vacations, ski trips, and hunting or fishing expeditions that require weeks of planning and organizing.
In the Americans' view, all these activities are generally funny and relaxing, or are worth the discomfort they may cause because they contribute to health and physical fitness.
</p>
<p>
Much American recreation is highly organized.
There are classes, clubs, leagues, newsletters, contests, exhibitions and conventions centered on hundreds of different recreational activities.
People interested in astronomy, bird watching, cooking, dancing, ecology, fencing, gardening, and hiking&#151;and on and on&#151;can find a group of like-minded people with whom to meet, learn, and practice or perform.
</p>

In America, recreation is a big business.
Many common recreational activities require supplies and equipment that can be quite costly.
Recreational vehicles (used for travelling and usually including provisions for sleeping, cooking, and bathing) can cost as much as 35,000 dollars.
In 1984 Americans owned approximately 3,982,000 recreational vehicles, valued at about 7,733 million dollars.
Jogging shoes, hiking boots, fishing and camping supplies, cameras, telescopes, gourmet cookware, and bowling ball are not low-cost items.
Beyond equipment, there is clothing.
The fashion industry has successfully persuaded many Americans that they must be properly dressed for jogging, playing tennis, skiing, swimming, and so on.
Fashionable outfits for these and other recreational activities can be surprisingly expensive.
