Road politeness is not only good manners, but good sense too.
It takes the most cool-headed and good-tempered of drivers to resist the temptation to take revenge when subjected to uncivilized behavior.
On the other hand, a little politeness goes a long way towards relieving the tensions of motoring.
A friendly nod or a wave of acknowledgement in response to an act of politeness helps to create an atmosphere of goodwill and tolerance so necessary in modem traffic conditions.
But such acknowledgements of politeness are all too rare today.
Many drivers nowadays don't even seem able to recognize politeness when they see it.
</p>
<p>
However, misplaced politeness can be dangerous.
Typical examples are the driver who brakes violently to allow a car to emerge from a side street at some hazard to following traffic, when a few seconds later the road would be clear anyway;
or the man who waves a child across a zebra crossing into the path of oncoming vehicles that may be unable to stop in time.
The same goes for encouraging old ladies to cross the road wherever and whenever they care to.
It always amazes me that the highways are not covered with the dead bodies of these grannies.
</p>
<p>
A veteran driver, whose manners are faultless, told me it would help if motorists learnt to filter correctly into traffic streams one at a time without causing the total blockages that give rise to bad temper.
Unfortunately, modem motorists can't even learn to drive, let alone master the subtle aspects of roadsmanship.
Years ago the experts warned us that an explosion in car-ownership would demand a lot more give-and-take from all road users.
It's high time for all of us to take this message to heart.
