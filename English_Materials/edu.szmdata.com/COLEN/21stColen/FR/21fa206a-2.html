In the late 1920s, Hubble studied the movement of galaxies through space.
His investigation led to the most important astronomical discovery of the 20th century&#151;the expanding universe.
</p>
<p>
Earlier observations about the movement of galaxies had been done by V. M. Silpher.
He discovered that galaxies are moving away from Earth at speeds between three-hundred kilometers a second and one-thousand eight-hundred kilometers a second.
Hubble understood the importance of Silpher's findings.
He developed a plan for measuring both the distance and speed of as many galaxies as possible.
With his assistant at Mount Vilson, Milton Humason, Hubble measured the movement of galaxies.
The two men did this by studying what Hubble called the "red shift."
It also is known as Doppler effect.
</p>
<p>
The Doppler effect explains changes in the length of light waves or sound waves as they move toward you or away from you.
Light waves speeding away from you will stretch into longer wavelengths.
They appear red.
Light waves from an object speeding toward you will have shorter wavelengths.
They appear blue.
</p>
<p>
Observations of forty-six galaxies showed Hubble that galaxies were traveling away from Earth.
The observations also showed that the speed was linked directly to the galaxies' distance from Earth.
Hubble discovered that the farther away a galaxy is, the greater its speed.
This scientific rule is called Hubble's law.
</p>
<p>
Hubble's discovery meant a major change in our idea of the universe.
The universe had not been quiet and unchanging since the beginning of time, as many people had thought it was.
And that, Hubble said, meant it probably began with an explosion of unimaginable force.
The explosion is often called the Big Bang.
