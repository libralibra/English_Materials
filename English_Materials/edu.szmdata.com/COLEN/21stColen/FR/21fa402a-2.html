<p>
I am haunted by the thank-you cards I have not sent.
By the ghosts of presents past.
</p>
<p>
There's the one that should have gone to Avis for my wedding flowers in 1997, or to Sharon for the birthday cake in '99&#151;not to mention the 15 or so that were supposed to go out in May after my daughter Savannah turned 1.
</p>
<p>
I used to be better about getting them out.
I've had parties and little pick-me-ups from friends, and I promptly followed up with a card.
I missed the one to my friend Avis only after hundreds of cards already had been sent.
After I ran out of my preprinted wedding notes, and after too much time had passed, I was too embarrassed, but I never forgot I owed her one. and part of me has always been afraid that she never did, either.
</p>
<p>
These days, I've accepted that I have TCI (thank-you card issues).
It is a condition marked by obsession, delay and a great deal of guilt about the ritual of thanks.
I'm not sure how I got it.
I feel that I'm always dashing, dancing, and putting out fires.
A part of me longs for the days when a thank-you card at a birthday party for a child too young to write was unnecessary.
</p>
<p>
It is a post-modern lament Judith Martin has heard before.
</p>
<p>
"I have no sympathy for the idea that an expression of gratitude is a burden on your time," says Martin, who writes the nationally syndicated "Miss Manners" column.
"And thank-you cards are the form for doing it.
It's not enough just to have the sentiment.
You have to convey it."
</p>
<p>
When I was young, my mom always stressed the ceremony of thanks, and my grandfather often reminded me that people don't have to do anything for you, so you must show gratitude.
</p>
<p>
It seems that I have to address some of my long-overdue cards now.
