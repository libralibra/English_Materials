<p class="storyTitle">Best Friends</p><p>
Best friends, even when they are not a part of our day-to-day lives, are essential to our well-being.
They supply the companionship, help, security, and love that we all need.
It is not easy to put into words exactly what a best friend is, because the matter is so personal.
From time to time, however, we may think about our best friends&#151;who they are, what characteristics they share, and why they are so important to us&#151;in order to gain a better understanding of ourselves and our relationships.
</p>
<p>
I recently asked several people for their opinions on the subject, beginning with the qualities they valued in their own best friends.
They all agreed on three traits:
reciprocity, honesty, and love.
Reciprocity means that one can always rely on a best friend in times of need.
A favor doesn't necessarily have to be returned;
but best friends will return it anyway, because they want to.
Best friends are willing to help each other for the sake of helping and not just for personal gain.
One woman said that life seemed more secure because she knew her best friend was there if she ever needed help.
</p>
<p>
Honesty in a best friendship is the sharing of feelings openly and without reserve.
The people I interviewed said they could rely on their best friends as confidants:
they could share problems with their best friends and ask for advice.
They also felt that, even if best friends were critical of each other, they would never be hurtful or spiteful.
</p>
<p>
Love is probably the most important quality of a best friend relationship, according to the people I interviewed.
They very much prized the affection and enjoyment they felt in the company of their best friends.
One man described it as a "gut reaction," and all said it was a different feeling from being with other friends.
Private jokes, looks, and gestures create personal communication between best friends that is at a very high level&#151;many times one person knows what the other is thinking without anything being said.
The specifics differ, but almost everyone I talked to agreed that a special feeling exists, which is best described as love.
</p>
<p>
I next asked who could be a best friend and who could not.
My sources all felt it was impossible for parents, other relatives, and people of the opposite sex (especially husbands or wives) to be best friends.
One woman said such people were "too inhibitive."
Personally, I disagree&#151;I have two best friends who are women.
However, I may be an exception, and most best friends may fit the above requirements.
There could be a good reason for this, too:
most of the people I interviewed felt that their best friends were not demanding while their relatives and partners of the opposite sex can be very demanding.
</p>
<p>
To the question of how many best friends one can have, some in my sample responded that it is possible to have several best friends, although very few people can do so;
others said it is possible to have only a very few best friends;
and still others felt they could have just one&#151;that single friend who is most outstanding.
It was interesting to see how ideas varied on this question.
Although best friends may be no less special for one person than another, people define the concept differently.
</p>
<p>
Regarding how long it takes to become best friends and how long the relationship lasts, all were in agreement.
"It is a long hard process which takes a lot of time," one woman explained.
"It isn't something that can happen overnight," suggested another.
One man said, "You usually know the person very well before you consider him your best friend.
In fact you know everything about him, his bad points as well as his good points, so there is little likelihood you can come into conflict with him."
In addition, everyone thought that once a person has become a best friend, he or she remains so for the rest of one's life.
</p>
<p>
During the course of the interviews, I discovered one important and unexpected difference between men and women regarding the qualities of their best friends.
The men all said that a best friend usually possessed one quality that stood out above all others&#151;an easygoing manner or humor or sympathy, for example.
One of them told me that he looked not for loyalty but for honesty, for someone who was truthful, because it was so rare to find this quality in anyone.
The women I surveyed, however, all responded that they looked for a well-rounded person who had many good qualities.
One said that a person who had just one good quality and not several would be "too boring to associate with."
Does this difference hold true beyond my sample?
If so, it means that men and women have quite different definitions of their best friends.
</p>
<p>
I have always wondered why my own best friends were so important to me;
but it wasn't until recently that something happened to make me really understand my relationship with my best friends.
My father died, and this was a crisis for me.
Most of my friends gave me their condolences.
But my best friends did more than that:
they actually supported me.
They called long distance to see how I was and what I needed, to try and help me work out my problems or simply to talk.
Two of my best friends even took time from their spring break and, along with two other best friends, attended my father's memorial service;
none of my other friends came.
Since then, these are the only people who have continued to worry about me and talk to me about my father.
I know that, whenever I need someone, they will be there and willing to help me.
I know also that, whenever they need help, I will be ready to do the same for them.
</p>
<p>
Yet, I don't value my best friends so much just for what they do for me.
I simply enjoy their company more than anyone else's.
We talk, joke, play sports, and do all kinds of things when we are together.
I never feel ill at ease, even after we've been apart for a while.
However, the most important thing for me about best friends is the knowledge that I am never alone, that there are others in the world who care about my well-being as much as I do about theirs.
Surely this is a comforting feeling for everyone.
