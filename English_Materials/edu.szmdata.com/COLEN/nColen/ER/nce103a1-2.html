<p class="storyTitle">Dining Customs in America</p><p>
Every country has its own peculiar dining customs.
Americans feel that the first rule of being a polite guest is to be on time.
If a person is invited to dinner at six-thirty, the hostess expects him to be there at six-thirty or not more than a few minutes after.
Because she usually does the cooking, she times the meal se that the hot rolls and the coffee and meat will be at their best at the time the guests come.
If they are late, the food will not be so good, and the hostess will be disappointed.
When the guest cannot come on time, he calls his host or hostess on the telephone, gives the reason, and tells at what time he can come.
Depending on the situation, guests sometimes bring a box of candy or some flowers to give to the hostess as a sign of appreciation.
</p>
<p>
As guests continue to arrive, it is usually considered polite for the men in the group to stand when a woman enters the room and continue to stand until she is seated.
However, most young people and some groups of older people that stress equality of the sexes no longer observe the custom.
A visitor should be sensitive to each situation and follow the lead of the Americans present.
</p>
<p>
When the guests sit down at a dinner table, it is customary for the men to help the ladies by pushing their chairs under them.
Some Americans no longer do this, so the visitor must notice what others do and do likewise.
Until the meal is under way, if the dinner is in a private home, a guest may avoid embarrassment by leaving the talking to someone else.
Some families have a habit of offering a prayer of thanks before they eat.
Other families do not.
If a prayer is offered, everyone sits quietly with bowed head until the prayer is over.
If the family does not follow the custom, there is no pause in the conversation.
</p>
<p>
There is a difference between American and European customs in using the knife and fork.
Europeans keep the knife in the right hand, the fork in the left.
They use both hands in eating.
Americans, on the contrary, use just one hand whenever possible and keep the other one on their lap.
They constantly change their fork to the left hand when they have to cut meat.
Between bites they put the fork on their plate while drinking coffee or buttering bread.
Europeans are more apt to drink coffee after the meal and to keep their knife and fork in hand until they finish eating.
</p>
<p>
Since Americans often lay their silverware down during the meal, certain customs have developed.
It is not considered good manners to leave a spoon in a soup bowl or coffee cup or any other dish.
It is put where it will lie flat (a coffee spoon on the saucer, a soup spoon on the service plate beside the soup bowl, etc.) but not on the tablecloth.
By doing this, one is less likely to knock the silverware onto the floor or spill the food.
Another difference in custom is that Americans and Europeans use the side of the soupspoon, not the tip.
</p>
<p>
Americans do not use silverware for eating bread.
They hold it in their fingers, usually breaking it first.
Other things that Americans eat with their fingers are corn on the cob, celery, radishes, and olives.
In America a person does not eat lettuce that way, nor pick up a soup bowl to drink what remains at the bottom.
</p>
<p>
If for any reason a guest has to leave the table during a meal, he or she should ask the hostess, "Would you please excuse me for a minute?"
When the meal is finished, the guests put their napkins on the table and rise.
Guests do not fold their napkins in the original folds unless they are houseguests and intend to stay for more than one meal.
</p>
<p>
Following dinner, guests usually stay for two or three hours, but the thoughtful person is careful not to overstay his or her welcome.
The host and hostess may urge a guest to stay longer in order to be polite, but most dinner parties break up at about 11 o'clock.
</p>
<p>
As the guests leave, it is the custom to thank the hostess for a very pleasant evening.
One may say anything that expresses appreciation.
Common expressions are:
"Good-bye.
It was so nice of you to have me," or "Good-bye.
It's been a thoroughly enjoyable evening," or "Thank you.
I've had a very nice time."
For larger favors than a dinner party, such as an overnight or weekend visit, it is customary to send a thank-you note.
