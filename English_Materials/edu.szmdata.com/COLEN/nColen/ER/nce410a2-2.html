<p class="storyTitle">Human Cloning, Don't Just Say No!</p><p>
That scientists have cloned a sheep sends academics and the public into a panic at the prospect that humans might be next.
That's an understandable reaction.
Cloning is a radical challenge to the most fundamental laws of biology, so it's not unreasonable to be concerned that it might threaten human society and dignity.
Yet much of the ethical opposition seems also to grow out of an unthinking disgust.
And that makes it hard for even trained scientists and ethicists to see the matter clearly.
While human cloning might not offer great benefits to humanity, no one has yet made a persuasive case that it would do any real harm, either.
</p>
<p>
Theologians contend that to clone a human would violate human dignity.
That would surely be true if a cloned individual were treated as a lesser being, with fewer rights or lower stature.
But why suppose that cloned persons wouldn't share the same rights and dignity as the rest of us?
A leading ethicist has suggested that cloning would violate the "right to genetic identity".
Where did he come up with such a right?
It makes perfect sense to say that adult persons have a right not to be cloned without their voluntary, informed consent.
But if such consent is given, whose "right" to genetic identity would be violated?
</p>
<p>
Many of the science-fiction scenarios prompted by the prospect of human cloning turn out, upon reflection, to be absurdly improbable.
There's the fear, for instance, that parents might clone a child to have "spare parts" in case the original child needs an organ transplant.
But parents of identical twins don't view one child as an organ farm for the other.
Why should cloned children's parents be any different?
</p>
<p>
Another disturbing thought is that cloning will lead to efforts to breed individuals with genetic qualities perceived as exceptional (math geniuses, basketball players).
Such ideas are repulsive because of the atrocities committed by the Nazis in the name of eugenics.
But there's a vast difference between "selective breeding" as practiced by totalitarian regimes (where the urge to produce certain types of people leads to efforts to eradicate other types) and the immeasurably more benign forms already practiced in democratic societies (where, say, lawyers freely choose to marry other lawyers).
Banks stocked with the frozen sperm of geniuses already exist.
They haven't created a master race because only a tiny number of women have wanted to impregnate themselves this way.
Why would it be different if human cloning became available?
</p>
<p>
So who will likely take advantage of cloning?
Perhaps a grieving couple whose child is dying.
This might seem psychologically twisted.
But a cloned child born to such dubious parents stands no greater or lesser chance of being loved, or rejected, or warped than a child normally conceived.
Infertile couples are also likely to seek out cloning.
That such couples have other options (in vitro fertilization or adoption) is not an argument for denying them the right to clone.
Or consider an example raised by Judge Richard Posner:
a couple in which the husband has some tragic genetic defect.
Currently, if this couple wants a genetically related child, they have four not altogether pleasant options.
They can reproduce naturally and risk passing on the disease to the child.
They can go to a sperm bank and take a chance on unknown genes.
They can try in vitro fertilization and dispose of any afflicted embryo&#151;though that might be objectionable, too.
Or they can get a male relative of the father to donate sperm, if such a relative exists.
This is one case where even people unnerved by cloning might see it as not the worst option.
</p>
<p>
Even if human cloning offers no obvious benefits to humanity, why ban it?
In a democratic society we don't usually pass laws outlawing something before there is actual or probable evidence of harm.
A moratorium on further research into human cloning might make sense, in order to consider calmly the grave questions it raises.
If the moratorium is then lifted, human cloning should remain a research activity for an extended period.
And if it is ever attempted, it should&#151;and no doubt will&#151;take place only with careful scrutiny and layers of legal oversight.
Most important, human cloning should be governed by the same laws that now protect human rights.
A world not safe for cloned humans would be a world not safe for the rest of us.
