<p class="storyTitle">Specific Taboos</p><p>
If someone gave you a lily at any time other than Easter, you might be surprised because in our culture a lily is regarded as a symbol of death.
Husbands here might feel hurt if some well-intentioned visitor gave their wives sexy undergarments.
Those are just two examples of taboo gifts in America.
</p>
<p>
So it is with other cultures.
1 We can't possibly mention all of the taboos here&#151;indeed, they probably are not all listed anywhere.
However, the following list covers some key taboos:
</p>
<p>
The Japanese customarily wrap their gifts in paper, but they don't use white paper (color of death);
they don't use bright colored paper;
and they don't use bows.
</p>
<p>
Don't give four of anything to a Japanese or Korean;
it is the "bad luck" number, like the number 13 in many cultures including the United States and England.
</p>
<p>
Don't give a clock to a Chinese;
the word for clock in Chinese has a funeral connotation to it.
</p>
<p>
For someone from Hong Kong, giving two of something, or a pair, carries better luck than a single item.
</p>
<p>
Among Latin Americans, the gift of a knife or knives suggests the "cutting" of a relationship;
yet this notion can be blunted by including a coin with the knives.
</p>
<p>
In the Middle East, a handkerchief suggests tears or parting, and therefore is inappropriate as a gift.
</p>
<p>
Flowers carry all kinds of symbolism:
purple flowers are the flowers of death in Mexico and Brazil;
the same with white flowers in Japan;
and white chrysanthemums are the flower of death in many European countries.
Also, it is considered bad luck in many European countries to present an even number of flowers.
Therefore, always present an odd number (except 13, of course).
</p>
<p>
When you present flowers to a person from Germany, always unwrap the bouquet first.
</p>
<p>
Giving red roses in Germany signals that you have strong romantic interests.
In fact, throughout history, the rose has signified "secrecy".
Consider the Latin word sub rosa, meaning secret, and note that many confessional booths in Catholic churches have carvings of roses above the doors.
</p>
<p>
Giving a French person a gift of perfume is carrying the proverbial coals to Newcastle.
</p>
<p>
In the Middle East, any pictures of partially unclothed females (even of famous statues) or of pet animals, like dogs who are considered dirty and lowly, are inappropriate gifts.
</p>
<p>
In rank-conscious societies like Japan, be careful to present gifts in accordance with position and prestige.
If several people are involved and you are uncertain about the hierarchy, give the group a joint gift (e. g., a silver tray, a carving, porcelain statue, fine molded glass).
</p>
<p>
Tone down corporate symbols on your gifts.
Either make them very subtle or simply insert your business card with the gift.
</p>
