<p class="storyTitle">Fatal Attraction</p><p>
The "Queen" of British murder mystery writing is, without doubt, Agatha Christie.
Although the writer herself died over 20 years ago, her 78 "Whodunit" novels continue to sell in huge numbers.
They have been translated into more than a hundred languages and they have sold over two billion copies.
</p>
<p>
The appeal of Agatha Christie's books, both in Britain and abroad, is not hard to understand.
Each book is cleverly constructed.
She uses characters that are easily recognizable and her plots develop almost like clockwork.
But most importantly, all her stories set a puzzle for the reader.
</p>
<p>
Nearly all of Christie's books start with a murder, forcing the reader to ask the question, "whodunit?", and all of them end with a solution.
The fun for the reader is in following the clues hidden in the story and trying to reach the correct solution before the author reveals it.
This formula appeals to the strongest of human instincts&#151;curiosity&#151;and its popularity shows no sign of going away.
</p>
<p>
Many of the mysteries are solved by one of the Christie's regular investigators, like the very confident Belgian, Hercule Poirot, or the apparently harmless little old lady, Miss Marple.
She also created a special setting for her stories which has become as familiar as some of her characters.
It is England between the two World Wars, where close-knit communities live in quiet villages or rich city folk assemble for weekends at grand country houses.
</p>
<p>
This world is ruled by a rigid social hierarchy.
The owners of the country houses, probably members of the aristocracy, are at the top, then there are the professional classes:
doctors, lawyers and businessmen.
At the bottom are the common people, who normally appear in the books as servants, cooks and gardeners.
When a murder is committed, there's no shortage of suspects to be investigated.
</p>
<p>
Agatha Christie's world is not quite a real world, which is one of the reasons why her books have not become dated.
This is a world which is safe and predictable until a murder shatters people's lives.
The crime must be solved so that the murderer can be arrested, but also, so that calm can be restored.
</p>
<p>
During most of Agatha Christie's life, England had the death penalty for murder.
So, once the crime in her books is solved and the murderer identified, that is the end for him or her.
There are no loose ends and the reader can sleep peacefully in his or her bed.
</p>
<p>
In the real world, of course, things don't happen quite like that.
Criminals go unpunished, people are wrongly convicted and there are miscarriages of justice.
In short, the real world is not a safe place.
It is for this reason that so many readers like to bury their heads in an old-fashioned detective story with a safe and predictable ending.
</p>
<p>
The kind of whodunit Agatha Christie wrote is certainly old-fashioned.
Few contemporary crime writers are producing this kind of book.
The modern crime novel is more morally and psychologically complex, often adding to "whodunit?", another question:
"whydunit?".
Modern writers are more interested in understanding the criminal's mind and what drives a person to kill.
They explore a world of crime that is much darker than anything imagined by Agatha Christie.
Instead of being comforting, most contemporary crime novels unsettle their readers.
</p>
<p>
But Britain's affection for what the Americans call the "cosy" school of crime fiction has not died.
Murder is still considered to be entertainment and the television schedules are full of detective dramas which end with a murderer safely under arrest.
</p>
<p>
Another sign of how popular whodunits have become are "Murder Mystery Weekends", offered by hotels.
Guests take on the characters of classic whodunit suspects and spend a weekend trying to find out who among them is the "murderer".
Or there are murder dinner parties, at which groups of friends get together to solve a crime over the dinner table, using specially prepared information about their character and their whereabouts.
If murder with your meal doesn't appeal, there are a range of popular board games and computer games to test your powers of detection.
</p>
<p>
But for some people it can become an obsession.
Letters still get sent to "221b Baker Street, London", home of Sherlock Holmes, perhaps the most famous fictional detective of all, asking for his help in solving a variety of mysteries.
So many letters arrive for the great detective, that the company which now occupies that address employs someone with the special job of answering them.
</p>
<p>
So long as human beings remain curious, there seems no doubt that the whodunit, in all its various forms, will continue to exert its fatal attraction.
