<p class="storyTitle">Performance and Technology</p><p>
For those persons interested in sports and the performance of athletes, the last half of the twentieth century has been an interesting time.
In some competitive sports, it is clear that greater strength, more rigorous training regimes, and better coaching are the prime factors that have resulted in the ever-increasing levels of performance.
Thus in track and field events, the same distances are run in a shorter time and throwing and jumping events show greater distances and heights.
The same factors have produced superior athletic performances in other sports such as wrestling, table tennis and badminton.
</p>
<p>
However, in some instances, it is not merely stronger athletes, more rigorous training and superior coaching which contribute to better and more frequent record-breaking performances, but rather it is the introduction of new and superior materials technology which has been responsible for the rapid increase in performance.
</p>
<p>
For example, prior to 1950, pole vaulting was a sport which had only the natural bamboo pole to assist the athlete in vaulting over the crossbar.
Vaulters with that technology were typically individuals with a strong upper body, rapid acceleration to the vaulting box where the end of the bamboo pole was planted, and the ability to use the flexibility of the naturally-grown bamboo in pulling into the appropriate position to propel feet over the crossbar, then push off with arms and shoulders.
Top performance at that time was about 15 feet (about 4.6 meters).
In the 1950s first the aluminium, and then aluminium alloy metal poles, were developed.
These were less likely to break than bamboo poles, were lighter, and only a little less flexible than bamboo.
During that period only modest increases occurred in heights of record performances.
However, in the 1960s a new synthetic plastic called fiberglass was used to make vaulting poles.
This material was almost as strong as the aluminium pole, but in addition had a degree of flexibility never possible with either bamboo or metal vaulting poles.
</p>
<p>
The more flexible fiberglass poles permitted a much greater "slingshot" action, first bending to a much greater arc and then reflexing to help propel the vaulter upward and over the crossbar.
The athlete most favored by this type of pole was no longer the explosive sprinter with greater upper body strength.
Instead, it favored the person with greater acrobatic skills.
This type of person could maximize the reflex action of the pole, and allow himself to be propelled as well by the pole's flexibility as by his own push from the pole.
Within a few years the top performances in pole vaulting were consistently over 19 feet in height&#151;an increase of about 25 %&#151;due primarily to the superior technology of the pole used in vaulting, and a different set of skills mastered by the athlete.
</p>
<p>
However, fiberglass was not only a successful material in pole vaulting.
It was quickly incorporated into the construction of superior javelins, better tennis rackets, lighter skis, superior golf clubs and better flycasting rods for fishing.
Fiberglass has been used widely along with other types of plastics in many sporting items.
For example, rowing boats for competitive racing are nearly all made of fiberglass embedded in polymeric plastics.
These racing boats are both lighter and stronger than the older wooden and aluminium shells which they replaced.
Likewise, sailboats have been greatly improved by the use of fiberglass and plastics.
Even the tillers, rudders, seats and paddles for other boats such as canoes, kayaks, and motorboats have been improved thanks to these new materials.
Protective helmets for football, boxing and wrestling have also used fiberglass and newer polymeric plastics.
Interestingly enough, fiberglass did not produce a superior bat for baseball and softball, where the greater rigidity of wooden and metal alloys continues to be preferable for hitting the ball farther.
</p>
<p>
Fiberglass has recently been replaced by graphite so that poles, rods and paddles are stronger, lighter and even more flexible.
As in fiberglass, the graphite fiber is incorporated into improved plastics to produce the desired flexibility and strength.
7 Beyond the materials incorporated into poles, rackets, bats, boats, bobsleds, etc., superior materials in flooring for basketball courts, running tracks, timing devices, scoreboards, and even TV and radio equipment have contributed to the efficiency and economic growth of sports at all levels.
</p>
<p>
Computer technology and computerized design have become incorporated into sports communication and recording/ timing equipment, and into the publication of educational and business items associated with sports activity.
Even the engineering and construction involved in sports arenas are reaping the rewards of improved technology.
</p>
<p>
And finally, one should recognize that sports clothing itself has contributed to increased athletic performance.
All of us are aware of the unique footwear available for each type of sports activity, and some of the claims made by the companies which produce these types of shoes may even be factually true!
Lighter, more comfortable clothing of all types has contributed, along with other technologies, to vastly improved athletic performances.
</p>
<p>
So, when you join the growing numbers of fans who cheer their favorite athlete or athletic team to victory, it is worth remembering the technological input which has assisted them in reaching their present performance levels.
While it is true that in the last 50 years athletes have pushed the limits of the human body and broken innumerable records, it is equally true that new materials have given them a distinct advantage.
