<p class="storyTitle">Aruba</p><p>
"The greatness of our people is their great cordiality" is a line from the national anthem of Aruba, and from the moment one sets foot on this beautiful island in the center of the blue Caribbean Sea, this will be found to be true.
The Arubans, descended from native Arawak Indians and Spanish and Dutch settlers, offer a warm welcome at any time of the year, but they show unusual hospitality and special happiness during the New Year's holiday, when the island's many gambling casinos and night clubs as well as other types of entertainment places celebrate the New Year with great festivity and warmth.
A spectacular midnight fireworks display will add to the celebration and musicians will walk from house to house singing good-luck greetings for the New Year.

But before putting on a party dress (dressing up is expected at Aruba's night clubs) one should see the island's many spectacular daytime attractions.
Sunbathers and swimmers can stretch out on seven miles of beautiful sunny beaches.
They can also head to the northern coast with its uncrowded beaches and snow-white sand dunes.
Divers will marvel at one of the Caribbean's largest shipwrecks, a 400-foot World War II German freighter that was abandoned by its crew and later sank off one of the famous beaches.
Experienced divers will want to explore the notorious CALIFORNIA, the only ship that received the sinking TITANIC's distress signals in that Atlantic Ocean tragedy.
Unfortunately, the CALIFORNIA failed to respond, thus it will be known forever as the "notorious" CALIFORNIA.
Experienced windsurfers can ride the fast-moving waves off the island, but beginners will want to try the calmer, shallower water near the shore, and divers will find many reefs full of colorful undersea life including coral, marine worms, and fish of unbelievable variety in color, shape and size.
Aruba also has many sports facilities for sailing, deep-sea fishing, water-skiing, golf, tennis, horseback riding, and less demanding activities like shuffle-board, table tennis, and countless board and card games
</p>

Of course, there's more to Aruba than sunny beaches and nightclubs.
The island boasts a fascinating history and has many historic sites to show for it.
These range from the Stone Age cave-wall drawings at the National Park to the marvelous 20th-century Dutch architecture in the capital city.
For natural wonders, there are the back roads of the northern coast where strange looking trees and rock formations can be seen.
The Natural Bridge, a dramatic coral structure 100 feet long and rising 25 feet above sea level, is also a favorite scene along the northern coast road.
And if a woman forgets to bring her beautiful dress for New Year's, there is no big worry&#151;Aruba is a shopper's paradise.
There are wonderful boutiques and duty-free stores throughout the capital and in the more than a dozen shopping malls and many luxury hotels.
If one is dressed for an elegant evening of entertainment, the casinos are places where one can place bets and hope to win a fortune.
Win or lose, a person is always lucky while visiting the fantastic island of Aruba!

Caribbean beaches are famous, but the cordiality experienced in Aruba makes it a true jewel in the crown of Caribbean islands.
