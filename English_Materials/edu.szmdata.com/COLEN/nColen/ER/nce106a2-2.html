<p class="storyTitle">The Older Subculture</p><p>
Although business people have a very high opinion of the opportunities in the youth market, elderly people have been largely neglected by marketers and frequently by society itself.
Many people feel that American marketers have gone too far in attempting to please the youth market and particularly those aged 18 to 34.
A recent survey found that over 40 percent of the nation's leading advertisers said the 50-plus market has little impact on their current marketing strategies.
An advertising executive observed that markets have long concentrated only on consumers below the age of 49.
He noted that "it is as if the world ceases to exist once you are beyond 49.
One of the problems with retailing in America is that merchants have lost touch with older customers&#151;their customer has changed, but they have not.
</p>
<p>
Why the neglect?
Many marketers consider the youth market to be attractive and exciting, whereas older consumers are thought to be dull and uninteresting.
Although this situation may be understandable psychologically, it may make poor economic sense, because middle-aged consumers hold considerably more promise for a wide range of consumer goods and services than do the young.
</p>
<p>
Nevertheless, many Americans&#151;even many marketers&#151;hold negative stereotypes about the 50-plus market that are not based on fact.
The following eight myths about this group can limit a company's success in attracting older customers:
</p>
<p>
i.
Older consumers are all the same.
(Actually this market is comprised of numerous groups.)
</p>
<p>
ii.
They think of themselves as old. (" Old
age" is typically 15 years older than they are, and doesn't begin until well past 70.)
</p>
<p>
iii.
They aren't an important percentage of consumers.
(Those 50 and over often have a lot of spending money and they account for almost one-third of spending on refrigerators, floor coverings, new cars, jewelry, and groceries.)
</p>
<p>
iv.
They won't try something new.
(A survey for one company found that in one year, 45 percent had tried a new brand of cereal, and 30 percent had tried a new canned soup and soft drink brand.)
</p>
<p>
v.
They have impaired mental faculties.
(Only about 5 percent have serious mental impairment.
Moreover, intelligence tests reveal little change from age 17 to 80.)
</p>
<p>
vi.
They are in poor health.
(Most are not disabled and will remain healthy until their last years.)
</p>
<p>
vii.
They keep to themselves.
(Many are socially active, are involved as volunteers, and are taking on new responsibilities.)
</p>
<p>
viii.
They aren't physically active.
(A recent Gallup poll revealed almost half of those 65 and over regularly engage in exercise.)
