<p class="storyTitle">Mother Tongue</p>
<p class="storyAuthor">Amy Tan</p>
<p>
I am a writer.
And by that definition, I am someone who has always loved language.
I am fascinated by language in daily life.
I spend a great deal of my time thinking about the power of language&#151;the way it can evoke an emotion, a visual image, a complex idea, or a simple truth.
Language is the tool of my trade.
And I use them all&#151;all the Englishes I grew up with.
</p>
<p>
Recently, I was made keenly aware of the different Englishes I do use.
I was giving a talk to a large group of people, the same talk I had already given to half a dozen other groups.
The nature of the talk was about my writing, my life, and my book, The Joy Luck Club. The talk was going along well enough until I remembered one major difference that made the whole talk sound wrong.
My mother was in the room.
And it was perhaps the first time she had heard me give a lengthy speech, using the kind of English I have never used with her&#151;a speech filled with carefully constructed grammatical phrases, burdened, it suddenly seemed to me, with nominalized forms, past perfect tenses, conditional phrases, all the forms of standard English that I had learned in school and through books, the forms of English I did not use at home with my mother.
</p>
<p>
Just last week, I was walking down the street with my mother, and I again found myself conscious of the English I was using, the English I do use with her.
We were talking about the price of new and used furniture and I heard myself saying this:
"Not waste money that way."
My husband was with us as well, and he didn't notice any switch in my English.
And then I realized why.
It's because over the twenty years that we have been together I've often used the same kind of English with him, and sometimes he even uses it with me.
It has become our language of intimacy, a different sort of English that relates to family talk, the language I grew up with.
</p>
<p>
You should know that my mother's expressive command of English doesn't reflect how much she actually understands.
She reads financial reports, listens to Wall Street Week (a TV financial news program), converses daily with her stockbroker, and reads many types of books with ease.
Yet some of my friends tell me they understand only 50 percent of what my mother says.
Some say they understand 80 to 90 percent.
Some say they understand none of it, as if she were speaking pure Chinese.
But to me, my mother's English is perfectly clear, perfectly natural.
It's my mother tongue.
Her language, as I hear it, is vivid, direct, full of observation and imagery.
That was the language that helped shape the way I saw things, expressed things, made sense of the world.
</p>
<p>
Lately, I've been giving more thought to the kind of English my mother speaks.
Like others, I have described it to other people as "broken" English.
But I shrink with pain when I say that.
It always bothered me that I can think of no way to describe it other than "broken", as if it were damaged and needed to be fixed, as if it lacked certain wholeness and soundness.
I've heard other terms used, "limited English", for example.
But they seem just as bad, as if everything is limited, including people's perceptions of the "limited" English speaker.
</p>
<p>
I know this for a fact, because when I was growing up, my mother's "limited" English limited my perception of her.
I was ashamed of her English.
I believed that her English reflected the quality of what she had to say.
That is, because she expressed them imperfectly her thoughts were imperfect.
And I had plenty of empirical evidence to support me:
the fact that people in department stores, at banks, and at restaurants did not take her seriously, did not give her good service, pretended not to understand her, or even acted as if they did not hear her.
</p>
<p>
My mother has long realized the limitations of her English as well.
When I was fifteen, she used to ask me to call people on the phone to pretend I was she.
In this guise, I was forced to ask for information or even complain and yell at people who had been rude to her.
One time it was a call to her stockbroker in New York. She had cashed out her small stock portfolio and it just so happened we were going to go to New York the next week, our very first trip outside California.
I had to get on the phone and say in an adolescent voice that was not very convincing, "This is Mrs Tan."
</p>
<p>
And my mother was standing in the back whispering, "Why he don't send me check, already two weeks late.
So mad he lie to me, losing me money.
</p>
<p>
And then I said in perfect English, "Yes, I'm getting rather concerned.
You had agreed to send the check two weeks ago, but it hasn't arrived."
</p>
<p>
Then she began to talk more loudly, "What he want, I come to New York tell him front of his boss, you cheating me?"
And I was trying to calm her down, make her be quiet, while telling the stockbroker, "I can't tolerate any more excuses.
If I don't receive the check immediately, I am going to speak to your manager when I'm in New York next week."
</p>
<p>
Why are there not more Asian Americans represented in American literature?
Why are there so few Asian Americans enrolled in creative writing programs?
Why do so many Chinese students go into engineering?
Well, these are broad sociological questions I can't begin to answer.
But I have noticed in surveys that Asian students, as a whole, always do significantly better on math achievement tests than in English.
And this makes me think that there are other Asian-American students whose English spoken in the home might also be described as "broken" or "limited".
And perhaps they also have teachers who are steering them away from writing and into math and science, which is what happened to me.
Fortunately, I happen to be rebellious in nature and enjoy the challenge of disproving assumptions made about me.
I became an English major my first year in college, after being enrolled as pre-med.
