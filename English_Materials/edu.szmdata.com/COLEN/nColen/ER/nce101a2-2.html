<p class="storyTitle">Benefits from Pets</p><p>
Recently, a number of US newspapers carried a very small article entitled "Things You Can Learn from Your Dog".
The article listed seven things done regularly by pet dogs which could be helpful to pet owners if they themselves did them.
These things are:
1) When your loved one comes home, run to greet him.
2) Eat with pleasure.
3) When it's hot, drink lots of water.
4) Take naps.
5) Don't bite, just growl.
6) When you want something badly, dig for it.
7) Give unconditional love.

There are many people who would like to insist that only human beings are capable of feeling the emotion of love.
However, there are many more people, usually pet owners, who feel that they not only love their pets, but that their pets love them in return.
This is only one, but a very important, benefit of owning a pet.
All of us want to enjoy good health.
Thousands of articles are written in newspapers and magazines giving advice of all types as to what people should be doing if they wish to improve their chances of having good health.
Most often this advice includes suggestions that we should eat right, exercise, take vitamins and get a pet.
Why get a pet?
Because more and more studies are showing that people who have pets are healthier, both physically and mentally, than those who don't.
Right now more than half of the households in the United States have a companion animal.
That includes 51 million dogs, 56 million cats, 45 million birds, and other small animals.

Besides the obvious things, like being cute, interesting to watch, and a lot of fun, pets do more for us than we often realize.
If you now have or have ever had a pet, you know how wonderful it is to have someone there for you, no matter how you look, how you are dressed, or what you are doing.
Pets love you unconditionally and don't require brilliant conversation.
A simple "good boy" and a pat on the head or scratch under the chin is enough for them.
They will find ways to let you know their appreciation of your praise, whether it is by wagging their tails, rubbing against you, purring, or simply looking at you with adoring eyes.

People who own pets often remark on what good company they are and what fun they have together.
Pet experts and researchers identify many other additional benefits that come with pet ownership or interaction.
In addition to those mentioned thus far, pets ease stress and anxiety, aid relaxation, provide a sense of security, and are a great diversion from troubles.
One medical study showed that people's blood pressure would fall when they stroked their pets.

Pets are increasingly being used in therapy for the elderly and those who have Alzheimer's disease or physical disabilities.
One lady in Tucson, Arizona, shares her lovely little dog with many elderly nursing home residents.
She takes her dog there at least once or twice a week and allows the elderly people to hold and pat her little dog.
They eagerly await its arrival and always ask when she and her dog will be back.
She is just one of hundreds of people who share their pets with the old and lonely.
And then, of course, there are countless stories of dogs trained to aid blind, deaf, or wheel-chair bound individuals, often allowing them to live independently when otherwise this would not be possible.
The love between these people and their four-footed friends is touching.
Even brushing or patting a dog is great physical therapy, and we all know the benefits of walking, which is something a dog needs too.
</p>

James Herriot, a country veterinarian in England, has been a very popular writer in the English-speaking world.
He has written a number of books and stories about pet owners and their pets.
Many of his stories tell of the love between them as well as the benefits that owners and pets derive from each other.
Part of his great popularity as a writer comes from the fact that people who love pets like to read about and identify with other pet lovers.
