1.
Love at first sight
</p>
<p>
It was love at first sight, I suppose.
And yet it wasn't just the way she looked.
It was also the way she talked.
</p>
<p>
We'd been for a stroll in the country, one lazy, hazy summer Saturday.
I felt about sixteen again&#151;walking close enough for our hands to keep touching in the hope that she might hang on.
</p>
<p>
At a little country pub overlooking Evesham vale, I popped the inevitable question.
</p>
<p>
"I'll have a Jameson," she replied.
</p>
<p>
"A what?"
</p>
<p>
"A Jameson.
You know, the famous Irish Whiskey."
</p>
<p>
"Oh," I said somewhat blankly.
</p>
<p>
"Haven't you tried it?" she said, laughing.
"Don't look so amazed, it's great.
Made from the finest Irish barley, the softest spring water, and it's distilled three times, so it's really smooth."
</p>
<p>
"Two Jamesons, please," I said to the barman a moment later.
And before going back to my partner I took a little sip&#151;just to see if she was right.
</p>
<p>
"Was I right?" she said.
"I saw you taking a crafty swig!"
</p>
<p>
"Excellent taste," I said.
</p>
<p>
She raised an eyebrow quizzically and said, "Are you talking about me, or the Jameson?"
</p>
<p>
2.
Can you control how well you age?
</p>
<p>
Perhaps you've noticed while some women really show age, others seem to defy it.
Aging well is the result of many factors.
Heredity, exposure to the elements, and, of course, the way you care for your skin.
As you get older, your skin demands special care.
The kind you get from Oil of Olay. The remarkable beauty fluid that works in mysterious ways.
</p>
<p>
You'll notice instantly how extraordinarily sheer and greaseless it feels.
As each cool, light drop disappears under your touch, precious fluids work to replenish your skin's natural fluid supply.
</p>
<p>
One touch will tell you just how smooth, how silky your skin has become.
Your skin will take on an altogether younger appearance as tiny lines mysteriously seem to fade from view.
</p>
<p>
Discover the mystery of Oil of Olay and discover younger looks at every age.
</p>
<p>
3.
Why did you stop asking for the window seat?
</p>
<p>
Frequent travelers often forget that a flight can be a breathtaking experience, not merely a means of transportation.
But at Hyatt, we believe every journey should be uplifting.
Even after you've landed.
</p>
<p>
That's why we fill our hotels and resorts with so many opportunities to broaden your horizons.
Unique restaurants in the sky where you can dine with sparkling cities at your feet.
Meeting rooms that free your imagination by opening to grand panoramas.
And lobbies that greet you with spectacular architecture and dramatic vistas.
</p>
<p>
Instead of merely a place to stay at your destination, a Hyatt is a destination in itself.
A place to experience.
A window seat that always rewards you with a fresh perspective.
</p>
<p>
So next time, ask to stay with the people of Hyatt.
We think you'll like what you see.
</p>
<p>
4.
If you think it's hard getting to Mars, try getting to plaque three millimeters below the gumline.
</p>
<p>
With all due respect to the Pathfinder program, exploring the farthest reaches of inner space can be almost as challenging.
That is, unless you have the sonicare sonic toothbrush.
Not only does it remove plaque bacteria from the surface, its 31,000 brush strokes per minute also create sonic waves which go beyond the reach of the bristles.
Gently cleaning between teeth and even below the gumline.
In fact, sonicare removes hidden plaque bacteria between teeth better than the leading power brush.
So like the Mars Sojourner, we too like to seek our life forms in hard-to-reach places.
Only we blow them away.
</p>
<p>
5.
This is the truth.
</p>
<p>
Human beings do not come with odometers.
So how do you tell who is a serious runner?
We don't believe serious runners are defined by how many miles they cover in a week.
They're defined by how important running is in their lives.
It doesn't matter why you run, or how far.
If it's important to you, you're a serious runner to us.
That's why we work so hard to make great running shoes.
Because the goal of a running shoe is very simple.
To keep you running.
</p>
<p>
The more comfortable you are, the more miles you'll run.
That's the idea behind the GEL-130.
</p>
<p>
6.

Turn burglary into attempted burglary.
</p>
<p>
When 3M Scotchshield Ultra Safety and Security Film is applied to windows, it resists penetration and helps keep glass in place through attempted break-ins, storms, even earthquakes.
It's another innovative 3M product that helps make your home more safe and comfortable.

</p>
<p>
8.
Diversity works.
</p>
<p>
It has long made sense to us at IBM to welcome and value individual differences.
We prove this commitment to our workforce every day.
Programs such as employee networking groups, child/ elder care, domestic partner benefits and flexible work hours help us attract and retain the best and most talented individuals.
And in our diverse marketplace, that's always good business.
