<p class="storyTitle">Dress for Success</p><p>
Since I had very early on discovered that the socioeconomic value of a man's clothing is important in determining his credibility with certain groups, his ability to attract certain kinds of women and his acceptance to the business community, one of the first elements I undertook to research was the socioeconomic level of all items of clothing.
</p>
<p>
Take the raincoat, for example.
Most raincoats sold in this country are either beige or black;
those are the two standard colors.
Intuitively I felt that the beige raincoat was worn generally by the upper-middle class and black by the lower-middle class.
</p>
<p>
First I visited several Fifth Avenue stores that cater almost exclusively to upper-middle-class customers and attempted to ascertain the number of beige raincoats versus black raincoats being sold.
The statistical breakdown was approximately four to one in favor of beige.
I then checked stores on the lower-middle-class level and found that almost the reverse statistic applied.
They sold four black raincoats to each beige raincoat.
</p>
<p>
This indicated that in all probability my feeling was correct, but recognizing that there were many variables that could discredit such preliminary research, I set the second stage in motion.
On rainy days, I hired responsible college students to stand outside subway stations in determinable lower-middle-class neighborhoods and outside determinable upper-middle-class suburban commuter-stations, all in the New York area.
The students merely counted the number of black and beige raincoats.
My statistics held up at approximately four to one in either case, and I could now say that in the New York area, the upper-middle class generally wore beige raincoats and the lower-middle class generally wore black ones.
</p>
<p>
My next step was to take a rainy-day count in the two different socioeconomic areas in Chicago, Los Angeles, Dallas, Atlanta and six equally widespread small towns.
The research again held up;
statistics came back from the cities at about four to one and from the small towns at about two-and-a-half to three to one.
(The statistics were not quite that clear-cut, but averaged out into those ranges.)
</p>
<p>
From these statistics I was able to state that in the United States, the beige raincoat is generally worn by members of the upper-middle class and the black raincoat generally worn by members of the lower-middle class.
From this, I was able to hypothesize that since these raincoats were an intrinsic part of the American environment, they had in all probability conditioned people by their predominance in certain classes, and automatic reactions could he expected.
</p>
<p>
In short, when someone met a man in a beige raincoat, he was likely to think of him as a member of the upper-middle class, and when he met a man in a black raincoat, he was likely to think of him as a member of the lover-middle class.
I then had to see if my hypothesis would hold up under testing.
</p>
<p>
My first test was conducted with 1362 people&#151;a cross section of the general public.
They were given an "extrasensory perception" test in which they were asked to guess the answers to a number of problems to which the solutions (they were told) could only he known through ESP. The percentage of correct answers would indicate their ESP quotient.
Naturally, a participant in this type of test attempts to get the right answer every time and has no reason to lie, since he wants to score high.
</p>
<p>
In this test, among a group of other problems and questions, I inserted a set of almost identical "twin pictures."
There was only one variable.
The twin pictures showed the same man in the same pose dressed in the same suit, the same shirt, the same tie, the same slices.
The only difference vas the raincoat&#151;one black, one beige.
Participants were told that the pictures were of twin brothers, and were asked to identify the more prestigious of the two.
Over 87 percent, or 1,118 people, chose the man in the beige raincoat.
</p>
<p>
I next ran a field test.
Two friends and I wore beige raincoats for one month, then switched to black raincoats the following month.
We attempted to duplicate our other clothing during both months.
At the end of each month, we recorded the general attitude of people toward us&#151;waiters, store clerks, business associates, etc.
All three of us agreed that the beige raincoat created a distinctly better impression upon the people we met.
</p>
<p>
Finally, I conducted one additional experiment alone.
Picking a group of business offices at random.
I went into each office with a Wail Street Journal in a brown envelope and asked the receptionist or secretary to allow me to deliver it personally to the man in charge.
When wearing a black raincoat, it took me a day and a half to deliver twenty-five papers.
In a beige raincoat, I was able to deliver the same number in a single morning.
</p>
<p>
The impression transmitted to receptionists and secretaries by my black raincoat and a nondescript suit, shirt and tie clearly was that I was a glorified delivery boy, and so I had to wait or was never admitted.
But their opinion of me was substantially altered by the beige raincoat worn with the same other clothes.
They thought I might be an associate or friend of the boss because that is what I implied, and they had better let me in.
In short, they reacted to years of preconditioning and accepted the beige raincoat as a symbol of authority and status while they rejected the black raincoat as such.
</p>
<p>
The experiment will give you an idea of why I have spent so many years and so much money in determining what constitutes upper-middle-class dress.
It is obvious from the experiment that secretaries and receptionists, who generally were not members of the upper-middle-class, did in fact recognize upper-middle-class clothing, if not consciously then at least subconsciously, and they did react to it.
Their reactions indicate that dress is neither trivial nor frivolous, but an essential element in helping a man to function in the business world with maximum effectiveness.
</p>
<p>
But does everyone react as the secretaries did?
</p>
<p>
For years, some companies have been attempting to increase the efficiency of employees by prescribing dress and establishing dress codes.
Most of these schemes have proved ineffective because they have been created by amateurs who don't understand the effect clothing has on the work environment.
Dress codes can work, but the assumption that clothing has a major, continuing impact on the wearer is erroneous.
True, you may feel shabby when you wear shabby clothes, and your morale may perk up a bit when you splurge on an expensive tie.
But clothing most significantly affects the people whom the wearer meets and, in the long run, affects the wearer only indirectly because it controls the reaction of the world to him.
My research shows that in most business situations the wearer is not directly affected by his clothing, and that the effect of clothing on other people is mainly controlled by the socioeconomic level of the clothing.
</p>
<p>
Let me say it straight out:
We all wear uniforms and our uniforms are clear and distinct signs of class.
We react to them accordingly.
In almost any situation where two men meet, one man's clothing is saying to the other man:
"I am more important than you are, please show respect";
or "I am your equal and expect to be treated as such";
or "I am not your equal and I do not expect to be treated as such."
