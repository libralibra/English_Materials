<p class="storyTitle">The Secrets of Good Health</p><p>
Exercise.
Eat right.
Don't smoke.
These are some of the most common words of advice to people who wish to stay healthy.
But a growing amount of scientific research shows that there is another, equally important, aspect to staying well, peace of mind.
</p>
<p>
Think about how your heart races while you are waiting to be called into the doctor's office or how unhappy a bad headache can make you.
There is a two-way connection between mind and body.
When one is bothered, the other feels it.
At the heart of the communications network are brain chemicals called neurotransmitters which communicate messages not only within the brain, but also within the body.
One key receptor, the immune system, is a network of cells and organs that work to fight off viruses and bacteria.
When you experience joy, fear, or relaxation, the immune system may increase or decrease production of disease-fighting cells, thus helping you to fight off the flu, or even cancer.
</p>
<p>
By now, how the immune system is affected by stress has been well documented.
In one study involving newlywed couples, for example, those who showed hostile behavior during a 30-minute discussion about marriage problems had lower immune functioning for the 24-hour period following the experiment than people who showed less negative behavior.
It is not just stress that can do damage.
One researcher thought that if the same cold virus was put under two different noses, the person who is depressed or anxious or pessimistic would be more likely to develop the cold.
</p>
<p>
What is it about stress and related emotions that can encourage poor health?
These feelings can cause the production of substances that damage or weaken our immune cells.
Negative emotions can also cause our bodies to produce fewer immuno-transmitters which ultimately help fight off disease.
</p>
<p>
If stress, depression, anger and other negative feelings can make you more likely to get sick, can the reverse be true?
Will you have a stronger immune response and greater health if you are happier, less stressed, and more optimistic?
Experts believe that the answer is yes.
There are studies showing that by employing certain mind-body techniques that help reduce stress and improve outlook, cancer patients can live longer.
But cancer patients aren't the only ones who can benefit.
Certain mind-body techniques can help all of us.
Research has found that when patients with chronic pain used relaxation therapies and other behavioral techniques to manage discomfort, they reduced their visits to the doctor by 36 percent.
Relaxation produces better health through deep, rhythmic breathing, muscle loosening, and a slower heart rate.
When some of the tension is taken out of the body, the strain is taken off the entire system.
Relaxation decreases blood pressure, heart rate and respiration and increases one's sense of well-being.
That is important because a body that is constantly tense will eventually give out.
</p>
<p>
There are dozens of mind-body techniques for you to choose from.
The key is to find one you're comfortable with and then do it regularly.
Simply writing about negative, unpleasant events may actually boost your immunity according to researchers.
Scientists are not completely sure why it works, but they know that when individuals write, it helps them organize events, which in turn gives them more understanding of the situation.
When you can give a stressful experience meaning through writing, you don't think about it or worry about it as much.
And when you reduce stress, you boost immune functioning.
How much you write or how long you write depends upon how much stress you feel about the event.
One doctor suggests that people write until they aretired of writing and then read over what they have written.
This helps make more sense of it.
Also, just talking about a stressful experience with a friend can have the same positive effect.
</p>
<p>
Study after study has shown that people with good support systems&#151;caring, helpful family, friends and co-workers&#151;have better health.
Researchers think that the understanding we get from them reduces stress, which in turn helps the immune system.
As one psychologist states, "When you have someone who loves you and cares about you to share your problems and feelings with, you don't feel you have to fight your problems, or the world, alone."
Another interesting study has shown that the more diverse your social network, the better, that people who have a number of different social relationships have a lower risk of getting colds than those with fewer.
</p>
<p>
There are other fast but effective mind-body relaxation techniques.
One could be called "belly breathing."
Sit in a comfortable chair in a quiet room.
Close your eyes.
Breathe through your nose, fill your lungs with air, then slowly release the breath through your mouth.
Another technique could be called "mindfulness."
Take a slow walk and be aware of exactly what is happening to you at each moment&#151;whether the wind is on your face, an insect is flying near you, or you hear birds singing.
Even if you continue thinking about problems, you will become calmer and distance yourself from your problems.
If you are at home, you might dance.
Put on some fast music, close the door, and let yourself go.
The dancing will energize you and that alone will make you feel better.
</p>
<p>
Whichever mind-body techniques work best for you, never rely on them and them alone to keep you mentally and physically well.
Like exercise, good nutrition and proper medical care, methods such as relaxation therapies are only one part of the recipe for good health.
Still, they are an important ingredient.
