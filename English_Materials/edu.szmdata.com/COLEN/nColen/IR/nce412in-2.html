<p class="storyTitle">Ambition</p><p>
In college, my friend Beth was very ambitious, not only for herself but for her friends.
She was interested in foreign relations, in travel, in going to law school.
"I plan to be secretary of state' someday," she would say matter-of-factly.
One mutual friend was studying literature, planning to go to graduate school;
he would be the chairman of the Yale English department.
Another friend was interested in political journalism and would someday edit Time magazine.
I was a biology major, which was a problem:
Beth's best friend from childhood was also studying biology, and Beth had already decided she would win the Nobel Prize.
This was resolved by my interest in writing fiction.
I would win that Nobel, while her other friend would win for science.
</p>
<p>
It was a joke;
we were all smart-ass college freshmen, pretending the world was ours for the asking.
But it was not entirely a joke.
We were smart college freshmen, and why should we limit our ambitions?
</p>
<p>
I've always liked ambitious people, and many of my closest friends have had grandiose dreams.
I like such people, not because I am desperate to be buddies with a future secretary of state but because I find ambitious people entertaining, interesting to talk to, fun to watch.
And, of course, I like such people because I am ambitious myself, and I would rather not feel apologetic about it.
</p>
<p>
What I mean by ambition is dreaming big dreams, putting no limits on your expectations and your hopes.
I don't really like very specific, attainable ambitions, the kind you learn to set in the career-strategy course taught by the author of How to Stomp Your Way to Success.
I like big ambitions that suggest that the world could open up at any time, with work and luck and determination.
The next book could hit it big.
The next research project could lead to something fantastic.
The next bright idea could change history.
</p>
<p>
Of course, eventually you have to stop being a freshman in college.
You limit your ambitions and become more realistic, wiser about your potential, your abilities, the number of things your life can hold.
Sometimes you get close to something you wanted to do, only to find it looks better from far away.
Back when I was a freshman, to tell the truth, I wanted to be Jane Goodall, go into the jungle to study monkeys and learn things no one had ever dreamed of.
This ambition was based on an interest in biology and several National Geographic television specials;
it turned out that wasn't enough of a basis for a life.
There were a number of other early ambitions that didn't pan out either.
I was not fated to live a wild, adventurous life, to travel alone to all the most exotic parts of the world, to leave behind a string of broken hearts.
Oh well, you have to grow up, at least a little.
</p>
<p>
One of the worst things ambition can do is to tell you that you're a failure.
The world is full of measuring tapes, books and articles to tell you where you should be at your age, after so-and-so many years of doing what you do.
</p>
<p>
I read an article recently about how one's twenties are the decade for deciding on a career and finishing your training, and the thirties are for consolidating your success and rising within your chosen job (and here I am in my thirties, not even sure what I want to do yet!).
With all these external yardsticks, the last thing anyone needs is an internal voice as well, whispering irritably that you were supposed to do it better, get further and that all you've actually accomplished is mush, since you haven't met your own goals.
</p>
<p>
The world is full of disappointed people.
Some of them probably never had much ambition to start with;
they sat back and waited for something good and felt cheated because it never happened.
Some of them had very set, specific ambitions and, for one reason or another, never got what they wanted.
Others got what they wanted but found it wasn't exactly what they'd expected it to be.
Disappointed ambition provides fodder for both drama and melodrama:
aspiring athletes (who could have been contenders), aspiring dancers (all they ever needed was the music and the mirror).
</p>
<p>
The world is full of people so ambitious, so consumed by drive and overdrive that nothing they pass on the way to success has any value at all.
Life becomes one long exercise in delayed gratification;
everything you do, you're doing only because it will one day get you where you want to be.
Medical training is an excellent example of delayed gratification.
You spend years in medical school doing things with no obvious relationship to your future as a doctor, and then you spend years in residency, living life on a miserable schedule, staying up all night and slogging through the day, telling yourself that one day all this will be over.
It's what you have to do to become a doctor, but it's a lousy model for life in general.
There's nothing wrong with a little delayed gratification every now and then, but a job you do only because of where it will get you&#151;and not because you like it&#151;means a life of muttering to yourself, "Someday this will be over."
This is bad for the disposition.
</p>
<p>
As you grow up, your ambitions may come into conflict.
Most prominently nowadays, we have to hear about Women Torn Between Family and Career, about women who make it to the top only to realize they left their most precious things behind.
Part of growing up, of course, is realizing that there is only so much room in one life, whether you are male or female.
You can do one thing whole-heartedly and single-mindedly and give up some other things.
Or you can be greedy and grab for something new without wanting to give up what you already have.
This leads to a chaotic and crowded life in which you are always late, always overdue, always behind, but rarely bored.
Even so, you have to come to terms with limitations;
you cannot crowd your life with occupations and then expect to do each one as well as you might if it were all you had to do.
</p>
<p>
People consumed by ambition, living with ambition, get to be a little humorless, a little one-sided.
On the other hand, people who completely abrogate their ambition aren't all fun and games either.
I've met a certain number of women whose ambitions are no longer for themselves at all;
their lives are now dedicated to their offspring.
I hope my children grow up to be nice people, smart people, people who use good grammar;
and I hope they grow up to find things they love to do, and do well.
But my ambitions are still for me.
</p>
<p>
Of course, I try to be mature about it all.
I don't assign my friends Nobel Prizes or top government posts.
I don't pretend that there is room in my life for any and every kind of ambition I can imagine.
Instead, I say piously that all I want are three things:
I want to write as well as I can, I want to have a family and I want to be a good pediatrician.
And then, of course, a voice inside whispers&#160;... to write a bestseller, to have ten children, to do stunning medical research.
Fame and fortune, it whispers, fame and fortune.
Even though I'm not a college freshman any more, I'm glad to find that little voice still there, whispering sweet nothings in my ear.
