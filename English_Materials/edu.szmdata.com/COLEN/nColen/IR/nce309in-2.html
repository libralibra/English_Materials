<p class="storyTitle">On Friendship</p><p>
Today millions of Americans vacation abroad, and they go not only to see new sights but also&#151;in those places where they do not feel too strange&#151;to perhaps meet new people.
No one really expects a vacation trip to produce a close friend.
But surely the beginning of a friendship is possible.
Surely in every country people value friendship.
</p>
<p>
The difficulty when strangers from two countries meet is not a lack of appreciation of friendship, but different expectations about what constitutes friendship and how it comes into being.
In those European countries that Americans are most likely to visit, friendship is quite sharply distinguished from other, more casual relations, and is differently related to family life.
For a Frenchman, a German or an Englishman, friendship is usually more particularized and carries a heavier burden of commitment.
</p>
<p>
But as we use the word, "friend" can be applied to a wide range of relationships&#151;to someone one has known for a few weeks in a new place, to a close business associate, to a childhood playmate, to a man or woman, to a trusted confidant.
There are real differences among these relations for Americans&#151;a friendship may be superficial, casual, situational of deep and enduring.
But to a European, who sees only our surface behavior, the differences are not clear.
</p>
<p>
Who, then, is a friend?
</p>
<p>
In France, as in many European countries, friends generally are of the same sex, and friendship is seen as basically a relationship between men.
Frenchwomen laugh at the idea that "women can't be friends," but they also admit sometimes that for women "it's a different thing."
And many French people doubt the possibility of a friendship between a man and a woman.
There is also time kind of relationship within a group&#151;men and women who have worked together for a long time, who may be very close, shaving great loyalty and warmth of feeling.
In French eyes this is not friendship, although two members of such a group may well be friends.
</p>
<p>
For the French, friendship is a one-to-one relationship that demands a keen awareness of the other person's intellect, temperament and particular interests.
A friend is someone who draws out your own best qualities, with whom you sparkle and become more of whatever the friendship draws upon.
Your political philosophy assumes more depth, appreciation of a play becomes sharper, taste in food or wine is accentuated, enjoyment of a sport is intensified.
</p>
<p>
And French friendships are compartmentalized.
A man may play chess with a friend for thirty years without knowing his political opinions, or he may talk politics with him for as long a time without knowing about his personal life.
Different friends fill different niches in each person's life.
These friendships are not made part of family life.
A friend is not expected to spend evenings being nice to children or courteous to a deaf grandmother.
These duties are primarily for relatives.
Men who are friends may meet in a caf&#233;.
Intellectual friends may meet in larger groups for evenings of conversation.
Working people may meet at the little bistro where they drink and talk, far from the family.
</p>
<p>
In Germany, in contrast with France, friendship is much more distinctly a matter of feeling.
Adolescents, boys and girls, form deeply sentimental attachments, walk and talk together&#151;not so much to polish their wits as to share their hopes and fears and dreams, to form a common front against the world of school and family and to join in a kind of mutual discovery of each other's and their own inner life.
Within the family, the closest relationship over a lifetime is between brothers and sisters.
Outside the family, men and women find in their closest friends of the same sex the devotion of a sister, the loyalty of a brother.
Appropriately, in Germany friends usually are brought into the family.
Children call their father's and their mother's friends "uncle" and "aunt."
Between French friends, who have chosen each other because they have similar points of view, lively disagreement and sharpness of argument are the breath of life.
But for Germans, whose friendships are based on mutuality of feeling, deep disagreement on any subject that matters to both is regarded as a tragedy.
Like ties of kinship, ties of friendship are meant to be permanently binding.
Young Germans who come to the United States have great difficulty in establishing such friendships with Americans.
We view friendship more tentatively, subject to changes in intensity as people move, change their jobs, marry, or discover new interests.
</p>
<p>
English friendships follow a still different pattern.
Their basis is shared activity.
Activities at different stages of life may be of very different kinds&#151;discovering a common interest in school, serving together in the armed forces, taking part in a foreign mission, staying in the same country house during a crisis.
In the midst of the activity, whatever it may be, people fall into step&#151;sometimes two men or two women, sometimes two couples, sometimes three people&#151;and find that they walk or play a game or tell stories or serve on a tiresome and exacting committee with the same easy anticipation of what each will do day by day or in some critical situation.
Americans who have made English friends comment that, even years later;
"you can take up just where you left off."
Meeting after a long interval, friends are like a couple who begin to dance again when the orchestra strikes up after a pause.
English friendships are formed outside the family circle, but they are not, as in Germany, complementary to the family nor are they, as in France, separated from the family.
And a break in an English friendship comes not necessarily as a result of some irreconcilable differences of viewpoints or feelings but instead as a result of misjudgment, where one friend seriously misjudges how the other will think or feel or act, so that suddenly they are out of step.
</p>
<p>
What, then, is friendship?
Looking at these different styles, including our own, each of which is related to a whole way of life, are there common elements?
There is the recognition that friendship, in contrast with kinship, implies freedom of choice.
A friend is someone who chooses and is chosen.
Related to this is the sense each friend gives the other of being a special individual, on whatever grounds this recognition is based.
And between friends there is inevitably a kind of equality of give-and-take.
These similarities make the bridge between societies possible, and the American's characteristic openness to different styles of relationships makes it possible for him to find new friends abroad with whom he feels at home.
