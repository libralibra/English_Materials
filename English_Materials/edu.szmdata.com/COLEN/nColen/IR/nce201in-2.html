<p class="storyTitle">Food and Culture</p><p>
We all have ideas about what kinds of foods are good to eat.
We also have ideas about what kinds of foods are bad to eat.
As a result, people from one culture often think the foods that people from another culture eat are disgusting or nauseating.
When the famous boxer Muhammad Ali visited Africa, for example, one member of his group became quite sick when he saw someone pick up a butterfly and eat it.
Many people would find it disgusting to eat rats, but there are forty-two different cultures whose people regard rats as appropriate food.
</p>
<p>
Some people in Africa think African termites make a delicious meal.
Many other people would probably be sick if they had to eat termites, but one hundred grams of termites contain more than twice as many calories and almost twice as much protein as one hundred grams of cooked hamburger.
</p>

However, food likes and dislikes do not always seem related to nutrition.
For example, broccoli is first on a list of the most nutritious common vegetables, but it is twenty-first on a list of vegetables that Americans like most to eat.
Tomatoes are sixteenth on the list of most nutritious vegetables, but they are first on the list of vegetables that Americans like most to eat.
</p>
<p>
But dislike is not the only reason why some cultures will not eat a certain food.
In some cultures, certain foods are taboo.
Taboo is a word from the language of the Fiji Islands that is used to describe something that is forbidden.
Some foods are taboo in certain religions, but there are also other food taboos that are not connected to a religion.
We do not usually think about why certain things are taboo in our culture.
We may not even know why they are taboo.
Anthropologists try to discover the hidden reasons for taboos.
For example, the sacred cows of India are well-known.
Cows can go wherever they want to in the streets of India, and they can eat anything they want from the supplies of the food sellers on the street.
As a result, the cows are a problem.
However, no one in India will kill them or eat them.
It is taboo to do so.
This custom seems strange to other people, but anthropologists believe that there are reasons for it.
First, cows are valuable because the farmers need them to help plow their fields.
Second, cow manure is used as a fertilizer on the fields.
In India, many farmers cannot afford to spend money on fertilizer.
Third, the cow manure can be dried and burned to make cooking fires.
Therefore, farmers that kill their cows for meat soon find that they cannot plow or fertilize their fields or make a cooking fire.
</p>
<p>
Another example is that Americans do not eat dogs, although people from some other cultures regard them as good food.
In the United States, dogs are very important to people as pets.
They are usually regarded as part of the family, almost like a child in some cases.
In addition, dogs have value as protection against criminals.
Thieves will not usually enter a house where there is a dog because the dog will bark and possibly attack a stranger who is trying to get into a house.
Apparently, the dog's place in society as a companion and as a protection against criminals makes the dog taboo as food.

<p>
The taboo against eating pork occurs in more than one culture.
There is some evidence that some ancient Egyptians did not eat pork.
The ancient Israelites also regarded pork as taboo.
One explanation for the pig-eating taboo is that pork that is not cooked sufficiently may spread a disease called trichinosis.
However, most people no longer think that this is a good explanation for the pork taboo.
Another explanation is that the Israelites were nomads&#151;they were always moving from place to place.
People have to stay in one place to raise pigs.
The Israelites did not want to stay in one place because they did not want to change their culture.
As a result, they did not eat pigs.
</p>
<p>
Anthropologists believe that most food likes and dislikes are a result of the ways of life of different people.
Some people live in areas where there are both large animals and many insects.
It is difficult for these people to kill large animals, and it requires a lot of energy.
It is easier for them to use insects for food because it is not difficult to catch insects and it does not require a lot of energy.
Nomadic people who move around will not want to keep pigs for food.
People will not eat pets such as dogs.
Americans eat a lot of beef because there is plenty of land for raising cattle and their meat can be shipped cheaply for long distances by railroads.
