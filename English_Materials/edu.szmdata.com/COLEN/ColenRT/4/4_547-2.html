<p class="storyTitle">The Finger of Suspicion</p>
<p>Fingerprints, one of the great deciders of innocence or guilt in criminal charges, are now being placed in doubt. This is because of a growing number of claims from defendants that their "prints" have been "lifted" and planted at scenes of crimes. And these allegations are being taken seriously by lawyers, judges, and policemen because it is possible to move a fingerprint from one spot and place it elsewhere. A committee of lawyers is making an investigation into fingerprinting. They are not aiming to establish if these allegations are true or not, but they are questioning current fingerprinting methods as part of a general inquiry into scientific evidence.</p>
<p>How can a fingerprint be transferred? A finger-mark left on a greasy glass or some other smooth surface can be "lifted" with a strip of adhesive. It can then be deposited on another, perhaps incriminating, object. Before 1973, fingerprints at the scene of a crime used to be photographed for identification purposes and the objects carrying the prints were shown in court as well. However, this is no longer necessary. Since 1973, a new method of taking prints has been used. Police experts can now use a strip of adhesive tape to "lift" a print, which is then produced in court as evidence. As a result, criminals are accusing the police of lifting their prints and planting them at the scene of a crime. And lawyers are worried about this increasing number of claims.</p>
<p>According to the ex-chief of Scotland Yard's fingerprint department, Mr. Harold Squires, more than 55% of the cases he now gets are making these claims. But so far he has not seen any fingerprint evidence that proves the allegations to be true. Lifting a mark and putting it on another object requires great skill and trouble. It is almost impossible but it can be done. It can usually be easily detected by experts, but there is a chance that even experts may not be able to tell. So he would like the old method of photographing prints and producing them together with the objects to be generally used again.</p>
