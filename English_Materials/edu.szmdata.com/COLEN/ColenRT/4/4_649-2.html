<p class="storyTitle">Preparations for Job Interviews</p>
<p>In some ways the employment interview is like a persuasive speech because the applicant (interviewee) seeks to persuade the employer (interviewer) to employ him or her. Several suggestions might prove helpful to the applicant as preparation is made for the actual interview.</p>
<p>A job applicant has the responsibility of ascertaining certain types of information prior to the interview. First, the applicant should know what kind of job he wants and how the job relates to his career objective. It is important that the applicant be able to state his reasons for wishing to work for a particular company. Second, the applicant should seek as much information as possible concerning the company. Relevant information for the applicant to locate includes such items as the location of the home and regional offices, the financial status of the company, plans for expansion, and company philosophy. Information about most major corporations is available in reference books and periodicals.</p>
<p>After gathering information concerning the company, the applicant is ready for the interview. The interviewer's first impression comes from the interviewee's appearance. For most interviews, appropriate dress for men is a conservative dark colored suit with a long sleeve, white or light blue shirt and conservative tie. For women a conservative tailored suit or dress is appropriate. Both men and women should have neat, conservative length hair.</p>
<p>Although hairstyle and dress are matters of personal taste, many personnel directors form initial impressions from these characteristics. For example, one recent college graduate, who felt himself qualified, interviewed for a public relations job. However, the personnel manager considered this young man's long hair, sloppy dress, and overly causal manner unsuited for this particular position.</p>
