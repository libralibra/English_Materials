<p class="storyTitle">The Private Ownership of Hydrogen Bombs</p>
<p>As soon as it was revealed that a reporter for Progressive magazine had discovered how to make a hydrogen bomb, a group of firearm fans formed the National Hydrogen Bomb Association, and they are now lobbying against any legislation to stop Americans from owning one.</p>
<p>"The Constitution," said the association's spokesman "gives everyone the right to own arms. It doesn't spell out what kind of arms. But since anyone can now make a hydrogen bomb, the public should be able to buy it to protect themselves."</p>
<p>"Don't you think it's dangerous to have one in the house, particularly where there are children around?"</p>
<p>"The National Hydrogen Bomb Association hopes to educate people in the safe handling of this type of weapon. We are instructing owners to keep the bomb in a locked cabinet and the fuse separately in a drawer."</p>
<p>"Some people consider the hydrogen bomb a very fatal weapon which could kill somebody."</p>
<p>The spokesman said, "Hydrogen bombs don't kill people&#151;people kill people. The bomb is for self protection and it also has a deterrent effect. If somebody knows you have a nuclear weapon in your house, they're going to think twice about breaking in."</p>
<p>"But those who want to ban the bomb for American citizens claim that if you have one locked in the cabinet, with the fuse in a drawer, you would never be able to assemble it in time to stop an intruder."</p>
<p>"Another argument against allowing people to own a bomb is that at the moment it is very expensive to build one. So what your association is backing is a program which would allow the middle and upper classes to acquire a bomb while poor people will be left defenseless with just handguns."</p>
