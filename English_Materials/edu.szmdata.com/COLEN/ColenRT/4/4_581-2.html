<p class="storyTitle">Libraries in Metropolitan Areas</p>
<p>Most London colleges have a library, with a full-time or part-time librarian, who will be able to give students information on the facilities available for consulting or borrowing books. In addition, the public libraries give valuable service to students attending colleges, evening classes or working on their own. Public libraries are maintained by the City Corporation and the various London Borough Councils. They will be helpful to students who wish to further their studies by using the comprehensive library services available in the metropolitan areas. These libraries have over five million books in stock, the majority of which are for loan, and there is a system of inter-availability of lending-library tickets which extends throughout the metropolitan area. Reference departments are provided for the use of those who wish to consult hooks and periodicals in the library, or heavy publications such as encyclopedias which cannot be taken out on loan.</p>
<p>Public library stocks are of a general nature, covering all subjects, many of them to higher degree standard or beyond. In addition, each public library in the metropolitan area specializes in a group of interrelated subjects and, through the cooperation between various libraries, their combined resources are made generally available. Moreover, through the inter-lending system of the British library, it is usually possible for books not available in London public libraries to be obtained from specialist libraries. Music stocks, for example, include music writings and records. Full details of these various services can be obtained from the central library in each area. Addresses and telephone numbers are listed in the London telephone directory.</p>
