<p class="storyTitle">Gallup Extreme Magic</p>
<p>The creator of a special version of high risk illusion, "Gallup Extreme Magic", Robert Gallup, is now performing in China. He has been obsessed with tricks since his childhood in the U.S..</p>
<p>Like many kids, Gallup received his first magic set for Christmas at the age of five. Unlike many kids, though, he didn't lose interest in it by New Year's Day.</p>
<p>In fact, he became so obsessed with magic that he spent all his pocket money on tricks. And by the age of 13, he was a good enough magician to be featured on U.S. TV. As he grew into a teenager, the native of Santa Barbara, California, became one of the youngest students at the Magic Castle in Hollywood, California&#151;at the time, the world centre of magic. During high school, Gallup performed in hundreds of bars across the U.S.. He went on to attend the University of California to study business. Gallup's passion for magic, though, made him consider options other than a business career upon graduation. "I decided that if I was ever going to take a chance and become a full-time magician, I had to do it when I was young."</p>
<p>"I never wanted to wonder, 'What if&#160;...&#160;', so I developed a business plan and raised U.S. $60&#160;000 to stage my 'dream' act."</p>
<p>Gallup perfected that dream act in North Carolina one summer where he performed four shows a day, seven days a week. It was hard work at the time, and he seemed to be "drowning" in debt, but eventually he started to get bookings&#151;first at small casinos, and later at some of the most prestigious venues in the world including La Scala in Madrid, Spain and the Super Bowl in Sun City, U.S..</p>
<p>Within a few years, Robert became the youngest person ever to put together a Las Vegas-style magic show. He acted as the producer, director, casting agent, production coordinator, lighting director and for the show that included a cast and crew of 22, and required three trucks to transport all the equipment.</p>
<p>Ten years, 22 countries and six continents later, Gallup has now taken his craft to a level held by few other magicians.</p>
<p>Part athlete, part artist and part daredevil A), Gallup describes what he does in a confident manner. "The concept of 'Extreme Magic' is simple? I want to take magic, and my audience, to the edge of reality and believability. When people see the show, I want them to not only say 'How did he do that?' but, 'I can't believe he even tried doing that!'"</p>
<p>Like all famous magicians, Gallup has developed several tricks over the years that are uniquely his own, including the "Pyre of Death" in which he has to escape from ropes and chains as burning, razor-sharp spikes move towards his body.</p>
<p>"I get a real adrenalin (hormone that stimulates the heart) rush every time I attempt that escape because there is always a very real possibility of it going wrong."</p>
