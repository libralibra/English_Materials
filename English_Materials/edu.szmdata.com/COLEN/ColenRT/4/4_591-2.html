<p class="storyTitle">The Effect of Noise Pollution</p>
<p>Doctors have known for a long time that extremely loud noises can cause hearing damage or loss. The noise can be the sound of a jet plane or machine in factories or loud music or other common sounds found at home and at work. A person only needs to hear the noise for little more than one second to be affected.</p>
<p>An American scientist has found the using of aspirin can increase the temporary hearing loss or damage from loud noise. He did an experiment, using a number of male students at a university, who all had normal hearing. He gave them different amounts of aspirin for different periods of time. He had them listen to loud noise for a short time, then he tested their hearing ability. He found that students who were given four grams of aspirin a day for two days suffered much greater temporary hearing loss than those who did not use aspirin. The hearing loss was about two times as great.</p>
<p>The scientist said millions of persons in the United States use much large amounts of aspirin than were used in the study. He said these persons face a serious danger of suffering hearing loss from loud noise.</p>
