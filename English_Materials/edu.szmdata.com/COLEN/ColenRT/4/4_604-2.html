<p>The natural world is now being damaged and destroyed by man. The seas and rivers are being poisoned by radioactive wastes, by chemical discharges and by the dumping of dangerous toxins and raw sewage. The air we breathe is polluted by smoke and fumes from factories and motor vehicles; even the rain is poisoned.</p>
<p>It's little wonder forests and lakes are being destroyed and everywhere wildlife is disappearing. Yet the destruction continues. Governments and industries throughout the world are making even greater efforts to extract the earth's mineral riches and to plunder its living resources. The great rain-forests and the frozen continents alike are seriously threatened. And this situation continues despite the warnings of the scientific community and the deep concern of millions of ordinary people and despite the fact, too, that we can create environmentally-clean industries, harness the power of the sun, wind and waves for our energy needs and manage the limited resources of the earth in a way that will safeguard our future and protect all the rich variety of life-forms which share this planet with us.</p>
<p>But there is still hope. The forces of destruction are being challenged across the globe&#151;and at the spearhead of this challenge is Greenpeace. Wherever the environment is in danger, Greenpeace has made a stand. Its scientific presentations and peaceful direct actions at sea and on land have shocked governments and industries into awareness that Greenpeace will not allow the world to be destroyed. Those actions, too, have won the admiration and support of millions.</p>
<p>Now you can strengthen the thin green line; you can make your voice heard in defence of the living world by joining Greenpeace today.</p>
<p>Someone's making waves.</p>
