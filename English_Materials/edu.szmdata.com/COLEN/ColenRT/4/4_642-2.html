<p class="storyTitle">Teachers and Pupils' Attitudes</p>
<p>Of all the areas of learning the most important is the development of attitudes. Emotional reactions as well as logical thought processes affect the behavior of most people.</p>
<p>"The burnt child fears the fire" is one instance; another is the rise of despots like Hitler. Both these examples also point up the fact that attitudes stem from experience. In the one case the experience was direct and impressive; in the other it was indirect and cumulative. The Nazis were indoctrinated largely by the speeches they heard and the books they read.</p>
<p>The classroom teacher in the elementary school is in a strategic position to influence attitudes. This is true partly because children acquire attitudes from those adults whose word they respect.</p>
<p>Another reason, it is true, is that pupils often delve somewhat deeply into a subject in school that has only been touched upon at home or has possibly never occurred to them before. To a child who had previously acquired little knowledge of Mexico, his teacher's method of handling such a unit would greatly affect his attitude toward Mexicans.</p>
<p>The media through which the teacher can develop wholesome attitudes are innumerable. Social studies, science matters of health and safety, the very atmosphere of the classroom&#160;... These are a few of the fertile fields for the inculcation of proper emotional reactions.</p>
<p>However, when children come to school with undesirable attitudes, it is unwise for the teacher to attempt to change their feelings by scolding them. She can achieve the proper effect by helping them obtain constructive experiences.</p>
<p>Finally, a teacher must constantly evaluate her own attitudes, because her influence can be deleterious if she has personal prejudices. This is especially true in respect to controversial issues and questions on which children should be encouraged to reach their own decisions as a result of objective analysis of all the facts.</p>
