<p class="storyTitle">Libraries</p>
<p>Libraries are in some way the best evidence we have of civilization. In them is the accumulated knowledge of the ages. The core of a college or university is its library. Schools are spoken highly of for the size and effectiveness of their libraries. Since libraries go on indefinitely and survive even the oldest teachers, they are full of very old books.</p>
<p>It is easy to think of a library as a place where a lot of old books sit unused on the shelf. On the other hand, libraries can be thought of as extremely timely and up to date. They have current books, magazines, newspapers, and other materials that would be very expensive and space-consuming if you were to subscribe to them all. Many libraries have extensive collections of non-book materials as well, including large recorded-music collections.</p>
<p>The best way to use a library is to have some idea of how it is organized. Then you can use the people in the library as efficiently as possible. It is the staff of the library that really make it work. They know where to find the information you need.</p>
<p>You should be aware that different people in the library have different jobs. They range from highly trained reference librarians to part-time clerical help who probably don't know much beyond their specific job. The first thing to do if you are looking for information on a particular topic is to find the right person to help you.</p>
<p>Approach one of the library staff members (preferably one behind the desk in the reference section), and say, "Are you a reference librarian?" If you get an affirmative answer, then explain what you are looking for and, if appropriate, why you are looking for it. The reference librarian can then make a professional judgment about what materials to lead you to. People differ, of course, but generally reference librarians are eager to demonstrate the special training and knowledge they have. Many will really go all out to help you.</p>
