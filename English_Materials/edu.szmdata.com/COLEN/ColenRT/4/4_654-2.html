<p class="storyTitle">Three English Dictionaries</p>
<p>Three English dictionaries published recently all lay claim to possessing a "new" feature. The <i>BBC English Dictionary</i> contains background information on 1&#160;000 people and place prominent in the news since 1988; the <i>Oxford Advanced Learner s Dictionary: Encyclopedic Edition</i> is the OALD plus encyclopedic entries; the <i>Longman Dictionary of English Language and Culture</i> is the LDOCE plus cultural information.</p>
<p>The key fact is that all three dictionaries can be seen to have a distinctly "cultural" as well as language learning content. That being said, the way in which they approach the cultural element is not identical, making direct comparisons between the three difficult.</p>
<p>While there is some common ground between the encyclopedic/ cultural entries for Oxford and Longman dictionaries, there is a clear difference. Oxford lays claim to being encyclopedic on content whereas Longman distinctly concentrates on the languages and culture of the English-speaking world. The Oxford dictionary can therefore stand more vigorous scrutiny for cultural bias than the Longman publication because the latter does not hesitate about viewing the rest of the world from the cultural perspectives of the English-speaking world. The cultural objectives of the BBC dictionary are in turn more distinct still. Based on an analysis of over 70 million words recorded from the BBC World Service and National Public Radio of Washington over a period of four years, their 1&#160;000 brief encyclopedic entries are based on people and places that have featured in the news recently. The intended user they have in mind is a regular listener to the World Service who will have a reasonable standard of English and a developed skill in listening comprehension.</p>
<p>In reality, though, the BBC dictionary will be purchased by a far wider range of language learners, as will the other two dictionaries. We will be faced with a situation where many of the users of these dictionaries will at the very least have distinct socio-cultural perspectives and may have world views which are totally opposed and even hostile to those of the West. Advanced learners from this kind of background will not only evaluate a dictionary on how user-friendly it is but will also have definite views about the scope and appropriateness of the various socio-cultural entries.</p>
