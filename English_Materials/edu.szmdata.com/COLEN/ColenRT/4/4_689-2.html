<p class="storyTitle">Culture Shock</p>
<p>Culture shock is so named because of the effect it has on people when they enter a new culture. Experts have been interested in these effects and have agreed on five basic stages of culture shock. These stages are general and should only be used as a reference. Not every individual will go through each stage, and one stage may last longer than another for different individuals.</p>
<p>The hardest thing for most travelers to deal with is the emotional "roller coaster" they seem to be riding. One moment they feel very positive toward the new culture, and the next moment very negative. It seems common that international visitors and immigrants vacillate between loving and hating a new country. Feelings of separation and alienation can be intensified if they do not have a sense of fitting in or belonging.</p>
<p>Fatigue is another problem people face when entering a new culture. There can be a sense of a greater need for sleep. This is due not only to physical tiredness, but also to mental fatigue. This mental fatigue comes from straining to comprehend the language, and coping with new situations.</p>
<p>The impact of culture shock can vary from person to person. There can be significant differences because some people may be better prepared to enter a new culture. Four factors which play into these are personality, language ability, length of stay, and the emotional support received.</p>
<p>It is logical to think that when people are deprived of their familiar surroundings they will feel disoriented. One solution some have found is to bring a few small reminders of home. Pictures, wall hangings, favorite utensils, and keepsakes are all good candidates to make things feel more familiar. Another helpful activity is to establish little routines that become familiar over time. Even better is fitting things that were part of the regular routine back in the home country into the routine established in the new culture. This will make people feel more at home.</p>
