<p class="storyTitle">Culture Differences</p>
<p>"Intercultural Communication" is communication between members of different cultures. This definition is simple, but the process is complex. Intercultural communication involves differing perceptions, attitudes, and interpretations. We know that even two people from the same culture can have communication problems. People can unintentionally hurt each other by something they say or do. Isn't it logical, then, that communication problems can be compounded among people who do not have the benefit of shared experiences (i.e., language and culture)?</p>
<p>Cultures do not communicate; individuals do. Everyone has a unique style of communication, but cultures determine a general style for their members. The relationship of the individual to his culture is analogous to an actor and his director. The actor puts his own personality into his acting but is nevertheless influenced by the director. We are not always aware of the subtle influences of our culture. Likewise, we may not perceive that others are influenced by their cultures as well.</p>
<p>Problems and misinterpretations do not result every time members from two cultures communicate. However, when cultural conflicts do arise, they may be perceived as personal rather cultural. In the following example it is a cultural misunderstanding that creates negative feelings and confusion:</p>
<p>A young woman from one culture is looking out of the window and sees a male acquaintance from another culture. He signals to her by puckering his lips. She quickly looks away from the window. Later she ignores him. He is confused and she is angry.</p>
<p>The misunderstanding was due to the woman's failure to understand the man's nonverbal signal. In her culture, his gesture conveys a sexual advance. According to his culture, he was only saying (nonverbally), "Oh, there you are. I've been looking for you." The woman's misinterpretation resulted in her angry reaction and his confusion. If the two had known more about each other's nonverbal cues, they could have avoided the cultural conflict.</p>
<p>Some misunderstandings are insignificant and can be easily ignored or remedied. Other conflicts are more serious in that they can cause misinterpretations and create persistent negative attitudes toward foreigners.</p>
