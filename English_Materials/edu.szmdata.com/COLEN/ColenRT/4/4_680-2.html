<p class="storyTitle">The Antler Riddle</p>
<p>Scotland Yard's top fingerprint expert, Detective Chief Superintendent Gerald Lambourne had a request from the British Museum's Prehistoric Department to focus his magnifying glass on a mystery "somewhat outside my usual beat".</p>
<p>This was not a question of Whodunit, but Who Was It. The blunt instruments he pored over were the antlers of red deer, dated by radio-carbon examination as being up to 5&#160;000 years old. They were used as mining picks by Neolithic man to hack flints and chalk, and the fingerprints he was looking for were of our remote ancestors who had last wielded them.</p>
<p>The antlers were unearthed in July during the British Museum's five-year-long excavation at Grime's Graves, near Thetford, Norfolk, a 93-acre site containing more than 600 vertical shafts in the chalk some 40 feet deep. From artifacts found in many parts of Britain it is evident that flint was extensively used by Neolithic man as he slowly learned how to farm land in the period from 3&#160;000 to 1&#160;500 BC.</p>
<p>Flint was especially used for axe-heads to clear forests for agriculture, and the quality of the flint on the Norfolk site suggests that the miners there were kept busy with many orders.</p>
<p>What excited Mr. G. de G. Sieveking, the museum's deputy director of the excavations, was the dried mud still sticking to some of them. "Our deduction is that the miners coated the base of the antlers with mud so that they could get a better grip," he says. "The exciting possibility was that fingerprints left in this mud might at last identify as individuals a people who have left few relics, who could not read or write, but who may have had much more intelligence than has been supposed in the past."</p>
<p>Chief Superintendent Lambourne, who four years ago had "assisted" the British Museum by taking the fingerprints of a 4&#160;000-year-old Egyptian mummy, spent two hours last week examining about 50 antlers. On some he found minute marks indicating a human grip in the mud. Then on one he found the full imprint of the "ridge structure" of a human hand&#151;that part of the hand just below the fingers where most pressure would be brought to bear in wielding a pick.</p>
<p>After 25 years' specialization in the Yard's fingerprints department, Chief Superintendent Lambourne knows all about ridge structures&#151;technically known as the "tri-radiate section".</p>
<p>It was his identification of that part of the hand that helped to incriminate some of the Great Train Robbers. In 1955 he discovered similar handprints on a bloodstained tee-marker on a golf course where a woman had been brutally murdered. They eventually led to the killer, after 4&#160;065 handprints had been taken.</p>
<p>Chief Superintendent Lambourne has agreed to visit the Norfolk site during further excavations next summer, when it is hoped that further hand-marked antlers will come to light. But he is cautious about the historic significance of his findings.</p>
<p>"Fingerprints and handprints are unique to each individual but they can tell us nothing about the age, physical characteristics, even sex of the person who left them," he says. "Even the fingerprints of a gorilla could be mistaken for those of a man. But if a number of imprinted antlers are recovered from given shafts on this site I could at least determine which antlers were handled by the same man, and from there might be deduced the number of miners employed in a team."</p>
<p>"As an indication of intelligence I might determine which way up the miners held the antlers and how they wielded them."</p>
<p>To Mr. Sieveking and his museum colleagues any such findings will be added to their dossier of what might appear to the layman as trivial and unrelated facts but from which might emerge one day an impressive new image of our remote ancestors.</p>
