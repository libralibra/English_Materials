<p class="storyTitle">Elite Pool</p>
<p>The process of entering the confines of political and economic power can be pictured as a system in which persons are chosen from a potential elite pool. In this reservoir of possible leaders are the individuals with the skills, education, and other qualifications needed to fill elite positions. It is here that competition does exist, that the highest achievers do display their abilities, and that the best qualified do generally succeed. Hence, what is most important is entering this reservoir of qualified people.</p>
<p>Many in the masses may have leadership abilities, but unless they can gain entrance into the elite pool, their abilities will go unnoticed. Those of higher class and status rank enter more easily into this competition since they have been afforded greater opportunities to acquire the needed qualifications.</p>
<p>In addition to formal qualifications, there are less obvious social-psychological factors which tend to narrow the potential elite pool further. "Self-assertion" and "self-elimination" are processes by which those of higher social status assert themselves and those of lower social status eliminated themselves from competition for elite positions. A young man whose family has been active in politics, who has attended Harvard, and who has established a network of connections to the economic and political power establishments would not be unrealistic in his aspiring to a high position in the business or political world. On the other hand, a young man with less prestigious family background, no connections, and only a high school education or even a college degree from a state university would not likely expect a future place for himself at the top. As Prewitt and Stone explain, such an individual "has few models to follow, no contacts to put him into the right channels, and little reason to think of himself as potentially wealthy or powerful". Thus, self-selection aids in filtering out those of lower income and status groups from the pool of potential elites. Most eliminate themselves from the competition early in the game.</p>
