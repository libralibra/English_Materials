<p class="storyTitle">Virus Blockers</p>
<p>Computer experts have been gripped by fear of a dangerous illness. It is highly contagious, difficult to diagnose and in many cases impossible to cure.</p>
<p>It is not computer experts or programming staff who are likely to be affected, but rather the electronic data banks themselves. Computer programs are threatened by a computer "virus" that can paralyze entire computer networks once it has been smuggled into the system. Initially, the viruses were quite harmless. Amateur computer enthusiasts smuggled them into big electronic systems, where they showed up as little messages or games. Such spectacular cases of computer espionage have shown that the big data banks are efficient, but also vulnerable.</p>
<p>Many experts complain that computer safety has been neglected for too long. By threatening to place a computer virus into the heart of the electronic data system, a large company could be put under extreme pressure. The damage by computer viruses is already incalculable. The insidious thing about computer viruses is that if they are well programmed they will spread throughout the entire system unnoticed. Bit by bit they infect the programs that they have access to and then one day they jump into action all at once.</p>
<p>And there seems to be hardly any countermeasures. The chance of finding a computer virus in an electronic system without comprehensive knowhow and technical program assistance is practically zero.</p>
<p>As an antidote, "virus blockers" have been introduced to keep viruses from entering and detect viruses that have already gained access. The main attraction is the virus blocker is the first anti-virus program that protects itself against virus infection.</p>
