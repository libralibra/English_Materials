<p class="storyTitle">Holidays and Vacation</p>
<p>Holidays in the United States usually occur at least once a month. Most months have a national holiday that has been arranged to be celebrated on a Monday. The holidays have all been decided to be celebrated on a Monday so that the workers may have 3-day weekends, that is, Saturday, Sunday and Monday in order to rest or travel or do things with their families. Major holidays in the United States include New Year's Day, Christmas Day and the day, when we remember the first settlers of the United States, called Thanksgiving Day. In these holidays most businesses close and the workers stay at home and celebrate with their families.</p>
<p>Vacation can be from 2 weeks a year to 4 weeks a year. This usually depends on how long you have been working for a company, what type of position you have, whether you have a very high and important position and whether you can find someone to replace you. In this case, you might take a few days at a time rather than take one month all at once. Usually the more time you spend working for a company, the more time you may get for a vacation.</p>
