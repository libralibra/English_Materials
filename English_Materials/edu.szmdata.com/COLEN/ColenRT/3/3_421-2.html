<p class="storyTitle">America's Influence on Chinese Culture</p>
<p>Throughout the history of mankind, whenever two civilizations contact with each other, cultural adoption happens.</p>
<p>Like many other cultures, Chinese culture has been influenced by American culture in many areas such as food, language, customs, beliefs, religion, traditions and festivals.</p>
<p>One of the major areas of Chinese culture, which has been affected, is food, which is the god of Chinese people. There are many different ways of cooking that have been used for thousands of years in China; however, the first American food business that is growing rapidly nowadays began in China less than 100 years ago.</p>
<p>One of the factors is United States scientific and technological advances. Some Chinese believe that American food has more nutrition than theirs; furthermore, American food is easier and faster to cook than Chinese food. For these reasons Chinese have already accepted American food about 20 years ago, most Chinese had never heard of sandwiches, hamburgers, or hot dogs. As time goes by, not only they are eating American food, such as McDonald's, KFC, but also many Chinese are doing the same. Obviously the concept of American food has been a part of Chinese culture.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the American food has been absorbed into the Chinese culture. There is no doubt that the inter-influence between these cultures will continue in the future.</p>
