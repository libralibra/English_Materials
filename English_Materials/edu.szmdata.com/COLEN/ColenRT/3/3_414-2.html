<p class="storyTitle">Time Problem</p>
<p>"Time is a problem for kids," states a news report for a new Swiss watch. Children in some countries "learn time slowly" because "they don't wear watches" and "parents don't really know how to teach them time". The kids grow up with this handicap and become adults and then can't get to work on time. Is there an answer to this problem? Of course it's the Flik Flak, made by a famous Swiss watch company.</p>
<p>The Flik Flak is being marketed as some teaching watch for children aged 4 to 10. The watch itself does not teach kids how to tell time, of course; it merely "captures their imagination" by presenting the "hour" hand as a beautiful red girl named Flak and the "minute" hand as a tall blue boy named Flik. Flik points to corresponding "blue" minutes on the dial, while Flak points to red hour numbers. The characters and the colors combined with parental help, are supposed to teach young children how to tell time.</p>
<p>The watch comes equipped with a standard battery and a nylon band. Peter Lipkin, the United States sales manager for the Flik Flak, calls it "kidproof: if it gets dirty you can throw the whole watch in the washing machine". The product is being sold in select department stores in Europe, Asia and the United States for a suggested price of $25. Parents who buy the watch may discover that it is one thing for kids to tell time; it's quite another for them to be on time.</p>
