<p class="storyTitle">Examinations</p>
<p>Examinations have come to exercise so great an influence in the modern age that it may be difficult to take a view of them unclouded by prejudices. Those who pass examinations have an interest in encouraging their use and in emphasizing their advantages. Those who fail may be in danger of accepting a pessimistic view of their own abilities which could affect their whole future. Here lies a great danger, for even in society in which everyone would be given an equal chance, no means of selection can be tolerated which depresses the ambition of those rejected. There was little disgrace in failing an examination at a time when only a small elite was involved. Nowadays nearly everyone is examined and graded at one level or another, and opportunity for promotion is becoming steadily more available to those who pass the tests.</p>
<p>Examinations are important, but what is regrettable is that there is a tendency to put aside that which is not to be estimated by examinations. Moral excellence and strength of character, though encouraged in schools by tradition, come second to examination technique when a pupil applies for entrance to the next stage of education. But we must bear in mind that it is the defects in personal qualities rather than lack of knowledge which are responsible for failures in life.</p>
