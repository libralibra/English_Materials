<p class="storyTitle">Napoleon's Waterloo</p>
<p>Napoleon Bonaparte was born in the little Island of Corsica, south of France, of rather undistinguished parents. He rose from obscurity, and through his brilliant military campaigns and political maneuvers, became Emperor of France. Not content with the extent of his empire, which then included the Kingdom of Italy, he proceeded with the conquest of other lands. He fought and defeated combined armies of Austria, Bavaria, and Spain and placed his brothers as kings of these countries.</p>
<p>In 1812, however, he was unsuccessful in his invasion of Russia, losing most of his men in a severe, freezing winter of retreat. Early in 1813, although he defeated the armies of Prussia, Russia, England, and Sweden in many battles, he lost so many of his men that he was forced to retreat to Paris. In the face of the advancing army of these combined nations toward his capital, Napoleon was forced to abdicate his throne, and retire to the little island of Elba still with the title of Emperor, but only of the little Island. Louis XVIII took over the throne of France.</p>
<p>However, in March 1815, with an escort of 1&#160;000 of his old guards, he left Elba and returned to France. Wherever he went, his old soldiers joined him. Marshall New, a former army of Emperor Louis XVIII, was sent to stop him. But on seeing his old commander, Marshall New embraced Napoleon and, with his men, joined Napoleon's army. Louis was driven from his throne without a shot having been fired. Napoleon was again Emperor of France. He tried to make peace with many enemy nations but his propositions were turned down.</p>
<p>With 130&#160;000 men, Napoleon set out to meet the forces of the English under the Duke of Wellington, and of the Prussians, under Blucher. They met at Waterloo on June 18, 1815. Here Napoleon's army was completely crushed. The allied forces went on to Paris without opposition. Napoleon again abdicated his throne and surrendered to the British.</p>
<p>Napoleon was banished to the Island of St. Helena where he died of stomach cancer in May 1821. Since then Waterloo has come to mean one thing&#151;complete, dishonorable defeat.</p>
