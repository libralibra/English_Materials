<p class="storyTitle">Wearing a Seat Belt</p>
<p>More than 30&#160;000 drivers and front seat passengers are killed or seriously injured each year. At a speed of only 30 miles per hour it is the same as falling from a third floor window. Wearing a seat belt saves lives. It reduces your chance of death or serious injury by more than half.</p>
<p>Therefore drivers or front seat passengers over 14 in most vehicles must wear a seat belt. If you do not, you could be fined up to $50. It will not be up to the driver to make sure you wear your belt. But it will be the driver's responsibility to make sure that children under 14 not to ride in the front seat unless they are wearing a seat belt of some kind.</p>
<p>However, you do not have to wear a seat belt if you are reversing your vehicle or you are making a local delivery or collection using a special vehicle, or if you have a valid medical certificate which excuses you from wearing it. Make sure these circumstances apply to you before you decide not to wear your seat belt. Remember you may be taken to court for not doing so, and you may be fined if you cannot prove to the court that you have been excused from wearing it.</p>
