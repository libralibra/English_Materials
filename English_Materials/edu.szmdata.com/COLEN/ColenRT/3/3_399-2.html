<p class="storyTitle">Pay for Your College</p>
<p>High school students who, after graduation, would like to continue their education are frequently faced with many problems in financing college training. Free education is not so widespread at the college level as at the elementary and secondary school levels. There is usually a charge for tuition. In addition, for most students, going to college means living away from home, an expensive matter.</p>
<p>What, then, can be done by a student who finds that he must help to finance himself if he is to extend his education beyond high school? There are several possibilities. Scholarships are sometimes available. These are usually given partly on the basis of high grades. Therefore the day-to-day work in high school may be very important for determining one's chances of help from this source. Another source of help is the college loan fund, which is established for the purpose of providing loans to worthy students. A third plan is that of working one's way through school. Work may involve holding a part-time job outside the college. Sometimes it means assisting professors in laboratory work, library work, or office routine. Sometimes it means performing some services which the student body requires, such as helping in the preparation and serving of meals, working in college stores, and the like.</p>
