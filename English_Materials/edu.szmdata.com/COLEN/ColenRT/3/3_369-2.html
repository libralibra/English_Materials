<p class="storyTitle">Manners and Customs</p>
<p>In England recently three foreign gentlemen approached a bus stop. They studied the information on the sign attached to the concrete post and decided which bus to take. About five minutes later the bus they wanted came along. They prepared to board it. Suddenly there was a clamor behind them. People rushed onto the bus and tried to push them out of the way. Someone shouted insulting remarks about foreigners. The bus conductor came rushing down the stairs to see what all the trouble was about. The three foreign gentlemen looked puzzled and embarrassed. No one had told them about the British custom of queuing for a bus so that the first person who arrived at a bus stop is the first person to get on the bus.</p>
<p>Learning the language of a country isn't enough. If you want to ensure a pleasant visit, find out as much as possible about the manners and customs of your hosts. You will probably be surprised just how different they can be from your own. A visitor to India would do well to remember that people there consider it impolite to use the left hand for passing food at table. The left hand is supposed to be used for washing yourself. Also in India, you might see a man apparently shaking his head at another and assume that he is disagreeing. But in many parts of India a rotating movement of the head is a gesture that signifies agreement or acceptance. Nodding your head when offered a drink in Bulgaria is likely to leave you thirsty. In that country you shake your head to signify "yes"&#151;a nod indicates "no". Arabs are known for their sumptuous hospitality. At a meal in countries on the Arabian Peninsula, you will find that any drinking vessel is repeatedly refilled as soon as you drain it. The way to indicate that you have had enough is to take the cup of glass in your hand and give it a little shake from side to side or place your hand over the top.</p>
<p>In Europe it is quite usual to cross your legs when sitting talking to someone even at an important meeting. Doing this when meeting an important person in Thailand, however, could cause offence. It is considered too informal an attitude for such an occasion. Also when in Thailand avoid touching the head of an adult&#151;it's just not done.</p>
