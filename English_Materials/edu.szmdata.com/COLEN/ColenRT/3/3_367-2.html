<p class="storyTitle">On Being Punctual</p>
<p>A punctual person is in the habit of doing a thing at the proper time and is never late in keeping an appointment.</p>
<p>The unpunctual man, on the one hand, never does what he has to do at the proper time. He is always in a hurry and in the end loses both time and his good name. A lost thing may be found again, but lost time can never be regained.</p>
<p>Time is more valuable than material things. In fact, time is life itself. The unpunctual man is forever wasting and mismanaging his most valuable asset as well as others'. The unpunctual person is always complaining that he finds no time to answer letters, or return calls or keep appointments promptly. But the man who really has a great deal to do is very careful of his time and seldom complains of want of it. He knows that he cannot get through his huge amount of work unless he faithfully keeps every piece of work when it has to be attended to.</p>
<p>Failure to be punctual in keeping one's appointments is a sign of disrespect towards others. If a person is invited to a dinner and arrives later than the appointed time, he keeps all the other guests waiting for him. Usually this will be regarded as a great disrespect to the host and all other guests present.</p>
<p>Unpunctuality, moreover, is very harmful when it comes to doing one's duty, whether public or private. Imagine how it would be if those who are put in charge of important tasks failed to be at their proper place at the appointed time. A man who is known to be habitually unpunctual is never trusted by his friends or fellow men.</p>
