<p class="storyTitle">Musical Instruments</p>
<p>As with most aspects of Plains Indian culture, music was closely bound-up with religious beliefs. Instruments were played individually and during public dances, and there was music for almost every occasion.</p>
<p>In public ceremonies singing was combined with dancing and with music from a variety of instruments. The dancers shook rattles or pounded hand-held drums to underscore their foot-beats. Rattles were made of gourds or of turtle shells filled with pebbles or seeds. Drums generally were made by soaking a strip of wood in hot water and bending it into a circle, then the drum skin was tightly strapped over the circle with rawhide laces. While some Plains Indian drums had a single drum skin, as a tambourine has, there were others, such as the drums of the Ute, that had skins lashed onto both sides.</p>
<p>The whistle and flute were the only Plains Indian wind instruments. Whistles were made from the wing bone of an eagle, the bird that symbolized courage. The recorder-like flutes with finger holes along the top, were carved from a length of soft, straight-grained wood, like willow or box elder, that was split in half and hollowed out; the halves were rejoined with glue made from boiled hide scrapings and bound together with rawhide lace to make them airtight.</p>
