<p class="storyTitle">Unusual but Legal</p>
<p>Police Officer Tidwell left the station just after 8 a.m. on Sunday, June 4. He had spent a night on duty and was looking forward to his day of rest. By habit he took a short cut down the path behind Digby Hall Road and after a minute or two he saw a man climbing down a drainpipe from an open bedroom window of number 29. The man reached the ground and was dusting himself down when he felt his arm gripped.</p>
<p>"It's 8:15 on a Sunday morning," said the officer, "and this sort of thing seems an unusual adventure at such a time. Would you mind explaining?"</p>
<p>The man was obviously startled but kept calm. He said, "I know what you're thinking, officer, but it isn't true. This is a very funny mistake."</p>
<p>"It's part of my job to take an interest in unusual events. I think you've just left this house in a manner other than the customary one. That may be quite innocent, but I'd like to make sure." Tidwell took out his notebook and a pen. "Name, address and occupation and then, please, tell me your story."</p>
<p>"Charlie Crane. Lorry driver, from Nottingham, 51 Brecon Street. My story&#160;... "</p>
<p>"Yes. What were you doing like a fly on that wall, Mr. Crane?"</p>
<p>"Well, I had a breakdown yesterday and had to stay the night here. Bed and breakfast. The land lady's name is Mrs. Fern. She gave me breakfast at seven, and I was out of here in the right way and down at the lorry park by half past seven. It was only when I felt around for a cigarette I realized I'd left 80 pounds in my pay envelope under the pillow here at number 29. I always put it under my pillow at night. It's a habit I've got into. I even do it at home&#160;... "</p>
<p>"I see. Why didn't you miss it when you went to pay Mrs&#160;... What's her name?"</p>
<p>"I'd paid her last night. You've got to pay when you take the room, see? So I came rushing back, but it's Sunday, and she'd gone back to bed, and could I wake her? I rang the bell and banged on the front door for ten minutes before I came round here to the back and found my bedroom window still open. Up I went, then, up this pipe. She hadn't made the bed, and the money was still there, you know the rest, and I hope you believe it because&#160;...&#160;"</p>
<p>"Mr. Crane, what are you doing here? I thought you'd gone an hour ago." It was Mrs. Fern, speaking from the kitchen window at the corner of the house.</p>
