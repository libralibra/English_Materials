<p class="storyTitle">Bungee Jumping</p>
<p>Some years ago I read about a bungee jumper who died because the organizers forgot to tie him onto the bungee cords. Not surprisingly, jumping off a bridge with just an elastic rope tied to my legs lost its appeal for me until years later when I felt the need to prove myself.</p>
<p>I was struggling to make a go of a craft business. Lack of funds and chronic inexperience were feeding self-doubts. All I could see were life's missed opportunities: the failure to excel at school, pitiful performances on the sporting field, a series of bad career moves. I would use bungee jumping to leap away from all the negative factors in my fife and into a new, confident, creative "me".</p>
<p>The idea of bungee jumping brought mixed responses from family and friends, from exhilaration at successful bungee, to "No way, never." I was repeatedly warned about possible damage to my back or eyes. But my mind was firm.</p>
<p>At a weekend gathering of women in Taupe, New Zealand, I found nine others who agreed to jump with me from the bungee platform over the Waikato River. We decided to do it that Saturday afternoon; I felt scared.</p>
<p>Somehow, on arrival, I was the first on the platform. The river was a long way down&#151;47 meters to be precise&#151;and my fear rose to terror. I was already crying as they tied the cords round my ankles. But, as the organizer of the jumping party&#151;and another 15 women who'd come along to cheer us on&#151;turning back was not an option I'd take.</p>
<p>I stood on the edge terrified, but sure that once I jumped it would be OK.</p>
<p>"1&#151;2&#151;3 bungee," the team called, and I jumped. What a mistake!</p>
<p>The sensation of falling headfirst through the air was horrific. I would have given anything to stop. My hands shot up to cover my eyes as I screamed like a banshee.</p>
