<p class="storyTitle">Valentine's Day</p>
<p>Valentine's Day is named for Saint Valentine, an early Christian churchman who reportedly helped young lovers. Valentine was executed for his Christian beliefs on February 14 more than 1&#160;700 years ago, but the day that has his name is even earlier than that.</p>
<p>More than 2&#160;000 years ago, the ancient Romans celebrated a holiday for lovers. As part of the celebration, girls wrote their names on pieces of paper and put them in a large container. Boys reached into the container and pulled one out. The girl whose name was written on the paper became his lover or sweetheart for a year.</p>
<p>Lovers still put their names on pieces of paper and they send each other Valentine's Day cards that tell of their love. Sometimes they also send gifts, like flowers or chocolate candy. Americans usually send these gifts and cards through the mail system. But some used another way to send this message. They have it printed in a newspaper. The cost is usually a few dollars. Some of the messages are simple and short: "Jane, I love you very much." Others say more. This one, for example: "Dan, roses are red. Violets are blue. I hope you love me as much as I love you. Forever. Mary."</p>
<p>Most of the newspapers that print such messages are local, but <i>USA Today</i> is sold throughout the United States and 90 other countries as well. This means someone can send a valentine message to a lover in a far-away city or town almost anywhere in the world. These messages cost 80 dollars and more. An employee of <i>USA Today</i> says readers can have a small heart or rose printed along with their messages this year. Will this kind of Valentines Day message reach the one you love? Well, just make sure he or she reads the newspaper.</p>
