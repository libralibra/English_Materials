<p class="storyTitle">American Indians</p>
<p>American Indians played a central role in the war known as the American Revolution. To them, however, the dispute between the colonists and English was peripheral For American Indians the conflict was a war for American Indian independence, and whichever side they chose they lost it. Mary Brant was a powerful influence among the Iroquois. She was a Mohawk, the leader of the society of all Iroquois matrons, and the widow of Sir William Johnson, Superintendent of Indian Affairs. Her brother, Joseph Brant, is the best-known American Indian warrior of the Revolution, yet she may have exerted even more influence in the Confederacy than he did. She used her influence to keep the western tribes of Iroquois loyal to the English king, George III. When the colonists won the war, she and her tribe had to abandon their lands and retreat to Canada. On the other side, Nancy Ward held positions of authority in the Cherokee nation. She had fought as a warrior in the war against Creeks and as a reward for her heroism was made "Beloved Woman" of the tribe. This office made her chief of women's council and a member of the council of chiefs. She was friendly with the white settlers and supported the Patriots during the Revolution. Yet the Cherokees too lost their land.</p>
