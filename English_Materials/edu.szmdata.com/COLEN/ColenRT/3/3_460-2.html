<p class="storyTitle">Judge by Appearance</p>
<p>It is interesting to reflect how much we judge people by the clothes they wear. Long hair and patched blue jeans? A student, we say to ourselves instantly, and not living at home either or he wouldn't be going about with those holes in his sweater. A graceful lady in a close fitting dress, carefully cut nails and earrings must be a foreigner, we think. English women of that age don't dress so smartly, and she probably has money, too. Those shoes weren't bought in a chain store. And that man walking along the pavement over there? Well tailored suit, hat just at the right angle&#151;a businessman, of course and undoubtedly English. Why English? Well, it's raining, isn't it? Only an Englishman would carry his treasured umbrella, still perfectly rolled, in the rain.</p>
<p>I once read of a journalist who went into an extremely expensive department store dressed in her shabby clothes. She was eyed with suspicion as she examined the goods on display. When she finally decided on a small purchase, she said she had forgotten to bring enough money with her and asked whether she could pay by check. The assistant politely told her that checks were not accepted for goods of &#163;2 under. The next day she went back, dressed to kill, smelling of expensive perfume. She selected an even cheaper article, told the same story and her check was accepted without question. It only goes to show how easily we are impressed by clothes. I wonder if Stone Age Man selected his woman by the quality of the bearskin she was wearing?</p>
