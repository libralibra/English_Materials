<p>Participation in the classroom is not only accepted but also expected of the student in many courses. Some professors base part of the final grade on the students' oral participation. Although there are formal lectures during which the student has a passive role (i.e., listening and taking notes), many courses are organized around classroom discussions, student questions, and informal lectures. In graduate seminars the professor has a "managerial" role and the students make presentations and lead discussions. The students do the actual teaching in these seminars.</p>
<p>In the teaching of science and mathematics, the dominant mode of instruction is generally traditional, with teachers presenting formal lectures and students taking notes. However, new educational trend have emerged in the humanities and social sciences in the past two decades. Students in education, sociology, and psychology classes, for example, are often required to solve problems in groups, design projects, make presentations, and examine case studies. Since some college or university courses are "applied" rather than theoretical, they stress "doing" and involvement.</p>
<p>Professors may establish social relationships with students outside of the classroom, but in the classroom they maintain the instructors' role. A professor may have coffee one day with students but the next day expect them to meet a deadline for the submission of a paper or to be prepared for a discussion or an exam. The professor may give extra attention outside of class to a student in need of help but probably will not treat him or her differently when it comes to evaluating school work. Professors have several roles in relation to students; they may be counselors and friends as well as teachers. Students must realize that when a teacher's role changes, they must appropriately adapt their behavior and attitudes.</p>
<p>Many teachers believe that the responsibility for teaching lies with the student. If a long reading assignment is given, instructors expect students to be familiar with information in the reading even if they do not discuss it in class or give an examination. (Courses are not designed merely for students to pass exams). The ideal student is considered to be one who is motivated to learn for the sake of learning, not the one interested only in getting high grades. Grade conscious students may be frustrated with teachers who do not believe it is necessary to grade every assignment. Sometimes homework is returned with brief written comments but without a grade. Even if a grade is not given, the student is responsible for learning the material assigned.</p>
