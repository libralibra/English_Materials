<p class="storyTitle">Education in America</p>
<p>America has had a great respect for education from its earliest times. Education is now the most important factor in determining a person's social role and economic prospects. Universities were founded in the earliest days of the settlers who had come across from England. Harvard College was founded in 1636, only fifteen years after the Pilgrim Fathers had landed, and there were eight other colleges before 1776, though for a long time they had few students. Religious bodies were active in developing elementary and secondary schools, and soon after 1800 progress was made in the northeast towards universal education paid for from taxes. Except in the south, America was before Europe in providing schools for all children, and more recently in providing free education up to the age of eighteen.</p>
<p>Under the United States Constitution the Federal government has no power to make laws in the field of education; each state is fully responsible within its own territory. The Federal government can give financial help, and new laws have vastly increased its powers to help in this field. The Department of Health, Education and Welfare headed by a member of the cabinet, is responsible for these functions at federal level. Since 1960 it has contributed ever-increasing amounts of federal funds to local programs at all levels, including special assistance to schools in disadvantaged areas. Total public expenditure on education rose from $25 billion in 1960 to $120 billion in 1975, and thus more than doubled in real terms, to an amount twice as great per person as in any West European country.</p>
