<p class="storyTitle">Beware of Pickpockets!</p>
<p>Are you forty years old and fat? Do you wear fine clothes? Do you look rich? If so, be careful. There is a pickpocket looking for you. World travelers, away from home and usually carrying much money, are often troubled by pickpockets in foreign countries, but they should remember that there are pickpockets in their own country, too.</p>
<p>A typical pickpocket is under forty years of age, usually a male. He has nimble fingers and has trained himself in running. Generally, he carries a newspaper or magazine in his hand. He may appear fairly clever and pretend to be calm. He has learned his job from another pickpocket, and he repays his "teacher" by giving him a percentage of the money or things which he steals.</p>
<p>The good pickpocket always operates in crowded places. Very well-dressed men and slightly drunken men are the favorite victims of the pickpocket.</p>
<p>An average-sized department store hires about six or seven full-time detectives. These men and women are constantly looking for pickpockets and shoplifters detectives whose only job is to catch the pickpockets quickly. But a good pickpocket knows these things and is very careful. He is especially busy on buses, trains and subways between 11:00 a.m. and 3:00 p.m. when there are many shoppers with much money to spend. He carefully remembers the payday and bonus times of companies.</p>
<p>Pickpocketing and shoplifting together represent about 75% of daytime petty crimes in America. The sentence for these crimes is usually from three to five years in prison. After finishing their sentence, pickpockets and shoplifters seldom reform; they usually advance to more serious crimes. So, how about you? Are all your pockets buttoned? When you go home tonight, be careful.</p>
