<p class="storyTitle">A Journey</p>
<p>Knowing how English people always look for an empty compartment and are reluctant to talk to strangers I thought I was going to have a quiet trip up to Scotland. That suited me as I had a lot of work to do in preparation for my business meeting the following day. I always travel long distances by train. I can sit down and work at a table and in any case I find both driving and flying very nerve-racking and exhausting.</p>
<p>The journey turned out to be something of a nightmare. Our train was blocked by heavy snowfalls. When it became clear that rescue would take some time, everybody piled into one carriage to huddle together for warmth. So I spent the night singing and telling and listening to stories. We were airlifted out by helicopter in the morning.</p>
<p>Despite my ordeal I am glad I took the train. Some of my colleagues, traveling by car, never arrived at the meeting.</p>
