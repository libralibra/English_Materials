<p class="storyTitle">Children's Intelligence</p>
<p>As researchers learn more about how children's intelligence develops they are increasingly surprised by the power of parents. The power of the school has been replaced by the home. To begin with all the factors which are part of intelligence&#151;the child's understanding of language, learning patterns and curiosity&#151;are established well before the child enters school at the age of six. Study after study has shown that even after school begins, children's achievements have been far more influenced by parents than by teachers. This is particularly true about learning what is language-related. The school rather than the home is given credit for variations in achievement in subjects such as science.</p>
<p>In view of their power it's sad to see so many parents not making the most of their children's intelligence. Until recently parents had been warned by educators who asked them not to educate their children. Many teachers now realize that children cannot be educated only at school and parents are being asked to contribute both before and after the child enters school.</p>
<p>Parents have been particularly afraid to teach reading at home. Of course children shouldn't be pushed to read by their parents, but educators have discovered that reading is best taught individually&#151;and the easiest place to do this is at home. Many four-and five-year-olds who have been shown a few letters and taught their sounds will compose single words of their own with them even before they have been taught to read.</p>
