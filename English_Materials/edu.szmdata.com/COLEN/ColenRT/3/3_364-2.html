<p class="storyTitle">Aptitude</p>
<p>The term "aptitude" refers to the ability of an individual to learn and perform certain tasks. Behavioral scientists use the term to determine how much a person will benefit from specific training.</p>
<p>One aspect of aptitude is physical ability. A person with good finger dexterity may become a better piano player than another person who has less dexterity even though both have received the same number of piano lessons. Another component of aptitude is intelligence. Intelligence is the ability of a person to think clearly and logically. Intelligence is not necessarily measured by the amount of education a person has. Instead, it is measured by a person's ability to use "common sense". Perhaps the most important part of aptitude is interest. A person may have the physical and mental requirements for a specific job.</p>
<p>However, if he has no interest in training for that job or career, the chances of his success are small. On the other hand, many people have overcome great obstacles, such as a physical handicap, to succeed in an area in which they were given little chance for success.</p>
