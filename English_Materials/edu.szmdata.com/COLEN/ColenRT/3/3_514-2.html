<p class="storyTitle">Science Fiction</p>
<p>The obvious motive for writing is to earn an honest living, and the obvious motive for reading is to be entertained. But this does hold true for all kinds of literature. Science fiction differs from its cousins in having something extra to give. This fact is obscured by the ridiculous so-called science fiction produced in Hollywood. And unfortunately, it is these low-level products that the average person thinks of as science fiction. There are, however, thoughtful science-fiction stories that seriously consider the action of man on society and society on man.</p>
<p>In this, science fiction resembles the serious novel. But science fiction goes further in one respect: it does not deal with society as it exists, but with societies that may exist in the future. This turning to future has an importance, for society will not long exist if its leaders do not consider the future and make provisions for it. Truly important science fiction poses a social problem and suggests a possible outcome, though not necessarily a solution.</p>
<p>For instance, Robert Heinlein wrote a remarkable novel in 1941 dealing with the use of atomic weapons by the United States in ending a war. He not only predicted the new invention but also accomplished the more difficult job of predicting the consequences of it. In his story, people were faced with the problem of controlling the deadly atomic menace after the war. He also pointed out that atomic weapons could not long remain the secret of one nation. Eventually, the world would be like a room full of armed men, each dependent on the good will of the others to stay alive. Had more statesmen seen the future as clearly as he did half a century ago, we might not be in the deadly situation that now exists.</p>
