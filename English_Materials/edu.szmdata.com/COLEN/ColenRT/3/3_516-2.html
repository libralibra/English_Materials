<p class="storyTitle">Stereotypes</p>
<p>Apparently, good will and education are not sufficient to destroy the power of stereotypes. If people treat others in such a way as to bring out behavior that supports stereotypes, they may never have an opportunity to discover which of their stereotypes are wrong.</p>
<p>I suspect that even if people were to develop doubts about the accuracy of their stereotypes, chances are they would proceed to test them by gathering precisely the evidence that would appear to confirm them.</p>
<p>The experiments I have described help to explain the persistence of stereotypes. But, as is so often the case, solving one puzzle only creates another. If, by acting as if false stereotypes were true, people lead others, too, to act as if they were true, why do the stereotypes not come to be true? Why, for example, have researchers found so little evidence that attractive people are generally friendly, sociable, and outgoing and that the unattractive people are generally shy and aloof?</p>
<p>I think that the explanation goes something like this: very few among us have the kind of looks that virtually everyone considers either very attractive or very unattractive. Our looks make us rather attractive to some people but somewhat less attractive to other people. When we spend time with those who find us attractive, they will tend to bring out our more sociable sides, but when we are with those who find us less attractive, they will bring out our less sociable sides. Although our actual physical appearance does not change, we present ourselves quite differently to our admirers and to our detractors. For our admirers we become attractive people, and for our detractors we become unattractive. This mixed pattern of behavior will prevent the development of any consistent relationship between physical attractiveness and personality.</p>
<p>Now that I understand some of the powerful forces that work to perpetuate social stereotypes, I can see a new mission for my research. I hope, on the one hand, to find out how to help people see the flaw in their stereotypes. On the other hand, I would like to help the victims of false stereotypes find ways of liberating themselves from the constraints imposed on them by other members of society.</p>
