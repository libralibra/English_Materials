<p class="storyTitle">Philosophers</p>
<p>If it is the role of philosophers to explain to us what life is all about, then I think the great majority of them are doing a pretty bad job. They are acting under false pretences. What do they know of life&#151;shutting themselves away in dreary refuges from the real world and dealing only with second-hand experience? The university libraries of northern Europe are haunted by these unhappy-looking figures. They are not concerned with life, they are just depressed by the dismal climates they find themselves born into. If they had any get-up-and-go they certainly wouldn't sit around moping and lamenting how the world is going to rack and min. Still, I suppose if life is completely futile as they claim, why bother to go anywhere?</p>
<p>And yet, if they lived in more congenial climates, they would soon realize how trivial philosophy seems when the warm sunshine and clear skies enable them to live and really enjoy life. After all, who ever heard of a philosopher born and bred on a tropical island?</p>
