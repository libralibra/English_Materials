<p class="storyTitle">Books-on-tape</p>
<p>Americans may be reading fewer books, but they are listening to more. The books-on-tape business is booming. The audio industry, as it likes to be called, used to amount to little more than the odd stand in a book-shop; most customers assumed they were for the blind. As an American publisher puts it, books on tape give people a chance to utilize their downtime Statistics are vague, but Americans probably spend around $500 million a year on audio books, ranging from self-help guides to fiction.</p>
<p>Publishers say the market is growing by at least 10% a year. Purists prefer to rent books unabridged from mail-order firms like Recorded Books and Books on Tape. The latter boasts a library of 2&#160;700 works including a 40-tape version of <i>War and Peace</i>. The average book is on ten tapes and costs $18 to rent for a month.</p>
<p>Yet the biggest growth has come in the abridged market&#151;where the book is cut down to two tapes (or three hours of listening) and sold for around $15. Most of the new buyers are commuters or joggers. Lorry drivers are keen buyers; there are small books-on-tape stalls in pit stops.</p>
<p>The abridged books are usually read by well-known actors&#151;or by the authors themselves. Tapes by Richard Nixon and</p>
<p>Oliver North have all appeared in bookshops at the same time as their books. Literary agents, who used to cede the audio rights for a good lunch, now haggle</p>
<p>Despite the huge potential, the big bookshops tend to hide away their audio sections. One reason may be that selling hardback books at $30 is more profitable than selling tapes at $15.</p>
<p>This should change. Already a few specialist stores have sprung up. An audio shop close to Los Angeles airport, carries 6&#160;000 different tapes of books. Nearly all its business comes from selling tapes rather than renting them. It will soon open another branch in central Los Angeles.</p>
<p>Smarter shops and commercial success will probably never convert those in the publishing industry who think that books should be read&#151;and certainly not abridged. In private, though, publishers admit that many non-fiction books are too long anyway; they should have been cut by their editors in the first place.</p>
