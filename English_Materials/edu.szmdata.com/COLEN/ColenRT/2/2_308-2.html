<p class="storyTitle">A Climbing Expedition</p>
<p>Last summer Tom and his friends George and Bill wanted to take a vacation, but they did not have much money. They decided that a short mountain climbing expedition was the only trip they could afford. Since each of them was accustomed to climbing, the vacation would be a lot of fun.</p>
<p>Tom made all the plans. He decided that they should share the expenses for food and gas equally and that each one should bring some extra clothes because the weather at high altitudes is usually cold.</p>
<p>The boys were not in a hurry, so they climbed casually the first day. The weather was pleasant, and they enjoyed the fresh air as they climbed up a narrow path. Tom expected the weather to stay nice, but late in the afternoon there was a storm. The boys rushed toward a cave and decided to camp there that night.</p>
<p>When the sun rose the next morning, they continued climbing. As the boys went higher, the climbing became more dangerous, and by late that afternoon the trip appeared endless.</p>
<p>When they finally reached the top of the mountain, they saw a beautiful sight. The colors of the sunset were yellow, red, and gold. The boys relaxed and enjoyed the view. The farms and fields of wheat and corn below appeared very small. In the distance, they could see many trees, hills, and valleys.</p>
<p>Tom, George, and Bill spent four more days camping and exploring the mountains. When they returned from their vacation, they told their friend Jim about the fun they had had. Jim was envious. He had intended to go with them, but he could not go at the last minute because he had to work. Jim told the boys that he wanted to go with them whenever they decided to go on another mountain climbing expedition.</p>
