<p class="storyTitle">Stress</p>
<p>Cancer is among the top killer diseases in our society today and scientists have found out that stress helps to bring it on. It is worthwhile to consider, therefore, what are the causes of stress in our life, and whether we can do anything about them.</p>
<p>Are we under-employed, or overburdened with too many responsibilities? Do we have a right balance of work and leisure in our lives? Are our relationships with family, friends or fellow workers all they should be?</p>
<p>All these things can be a cause of stress, and it is best to face them honestly, and to bring our frustrations into the open. People who have a good row and then forget it are doing their health more good than those who bottle up their feelings.</p>
<p>If our self-examination has brought any causes of stress to light, let us consider what we can do about them. It is possible to change jobs. We can make more leisure and fill it more happily, if we will accept a different living standard. We can improve our personal relationships by a different attitude. It is we who allow other people to make ourselves unhappy. Often the little things that disturb us are not worth an hour's anger. The teaching in the Bible "Let not the sun go down upon your wrath" is good advice from the health point of view as well as the religious.</p>
