<p class="storyTitle">Reward</p>
<p>One evening Mr. Green was driving in his car along a lonely country road. He had been to London where he had drawn 50 pounds from the bank, and he was now returning home with the money which he had put in his pocketbook. At the loneliest part of the road a man in shabby, badly-fitting clothes stopped him and asked for a lift. Mr. Green told him to get into the car and continued on his way. As he talked to the man he learned that he had been in prison for robbery and had broken out of prison two days ago. Mr. Green was very worried at the thought of the 50 pounds that he had put in his pocketbook.</p>
<p>Suddenly he saw a police-car and had a bright idea. He had just reached a small town where the speed limit was 30 miles an hour. He pressed down the accelerator and drove the car as fast as it would go. He looked back and saw that the police-car had seen him and had begun to chase him After a mile or so the police-car overtook him and ordered him to stop. A policeman got out and came to Mr. Green's car. Mr. Green had hoped that he could tell the policeman about the escaped robber, but the man had taken a gun out of his pocket and had put it to Mr. Green's back. The policeman took out his notebook and pencil and said he wanted Mr. Green's name and address. Mr. Green asked to be taken to the police station but the policeman said, "No, I want your name and address now. You will have to appear at the police court later." So Mr. Green gave the policeman his name and address. The policeman wrote it down, put his notebook and pencil back in his pocket and gave Mr. Green a talk about dangerous driving. Then Mr. Green started up his car again and drove on. He had given up all hope of his 50 pounds, but just as he reached the outskirts of London, the passenger said he wanted to get out here. Mr. Green stopped the car, the man got out and said, "Thanks for the lift. You've been good to me. This is the least I can do in return." And he handed Mr. Green the policeman's notebook.</p>
<p>While the policeman had talked to Mr. Green, the thief had stolen the notebook.</p>
