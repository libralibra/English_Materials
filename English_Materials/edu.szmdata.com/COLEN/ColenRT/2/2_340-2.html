<p class="storyTitle">Apollonia</p>
<p>The modern village of Apollonia is on the coast, sixteen kilometers north of Cyrene. It is reached by a delightful road that drops down seven hundred meters over two huge steps of rock to the sea.</p>
<p>Tourists go down to Apollonia in the afternoon, after they have spent the morning in Cyrene. Both places were cities long ago, and they are full of interesting and beautiful ruins. There is more to be seen in Cyrene&#151;on the ground, you understand. If you want to know the excitement of an underwater city, Apollonia is the place.</p>
<p>Some ruins of Apollonia are on the mainland. Some are on an island a thousand meters from the shore. The rest now lie between, under eight or ten meters of water. The sea is warm, seldom rough. It is often almost as clear as glass.</p>
<p>On a still day, then swim out towards the island. Swim under water as much as you can, with your eyes open. Look down.</p>
<p>First you see a street, with houses and shops on both sides. Their roofs have fallen in, but the walls are standing. Some shops have a big stone table&#151;a counter perhaps&#151;and stone shelves. At the end of this street you come to a square. It has a wide pavement all around, and some buildings open directly on to the pavement. Were they caf&eacute;s? Did the waiters put tables and chairs on the pavement in summer long ago?</p>
<p>Over two thousand years ago the king of Egypt visited the city. He brought his daughter Cleopatra with him. She was ten years old at the time, and her father built a huge swimming bath for her. You can still see Cleopatra's Bath, behind the caf&eacute;s in the square. And you will not be surprised to hear that it is full of water.</p>
