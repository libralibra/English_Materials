<p class="storyTitle">Dilemma of Working Women</p>
<p>My husband and I got married in 1969 and for the first ten years of our marriage I was very happy to stay at home and raise our three children. Then four years ago, our youngest child went to school and I thought I might go back to work.</p>
<p>After several weeks of job-hunting, I found my present job, which is working for a small public relations firm. At first, my husband was very proud of me and would tell his friends, "My clever little wife can run that company she is working for."</p>
<p>But as his joking remark approached reality, my husband stopped talking to me about my job. I have received several promotions and pay rises, and I am now making more money than he is. I can buy my own clothes and a new car. Because of our combined incomes, my husband and I can do many things that we had always dreamed of doing, but we do not do these things because he is very unhappy.</p>
<p>We fight about little things and my husband is very critical of me in front of our friends. For the first time in our marriage, I think there is a possibility that our marriage may come to an end.</p>
<p>I love my husband very much, and I do not want him to feel inferior, but I also love my job. I think I can be a good wife and a working woman, but I do not know how.</p>
