<p class="storyTitle">Color</p>
<p>Are the 1980's and 1990's the era of color? According to some people they are. Now you can buy radios and electric fans in purple and pink. Restaurants have an emphasis on flowers and colorful plates. Cars are coming out in pink and aqua. Even bathroom fixtures are being made in "honeydew" and "blond". Part of the importance of the color of an object is that the color affects the way one feels about it. You want a vacuum cleaner to look light and easy, which is why it may be colored in pastels and light colors. But gardening equipment and athletic equipment you want to look powerful. You would never find a lawn mower in pink, but red would be fine. Not very long ago, sheets were always white, and refrigerators commonly came in colors like "Old Gold", "Avocado Green" and "Coppertone". Now those are thought of as old-fashioned. Popular colors change, because fashion influences everything. In fact, new colors often spring from the fashion industry. It is a lot cheaper to make a blouse or skirt than a sofa. After people get used to seeing new colors on clothing or towels, they have been very successful in recent years. People want to choose the most flattering colors for make-up and clothing. Some car designers are even saying that people may begin buying cars of the color that goes with their skin coloring. This sounds too extreme. It is hard to believe that people are that impressionable.</p>
