<p class="storyTitle">Money and Friendship</p>
<p>Recently, a professor of philosophy in the United States has written a book called <i>Money and the Meaning of Life</i>. He has discovered that how we deal with money in our day-to-day life has more meaning than we usually think. One of the exercises he asked his students to do is to keep a record of every penny they spend for a week. From the way they spend their money, he can see what they really value in life.</p>
<p>He says our relation with others often becomes clearly defined when money enters the picture. You might have wonderful friendship with somebody and you think that you are very good friends. But you will know him only when you ask him to lend you some money. If he does, it brings something to the friendship that seems stronger than ever before. Or it can suddenly weaken the friendship if he doesn't. This person may say that he has a certain feeling, but if it is not carried out in the money world, there is something less real about it.</p>
<p>Since money is so important to us, we consider those who possess a lot of it to be very important. The author interviewed some millionaires in researching his book.</p>
<p>Answer: The most surprising thing is that people give me so much respect. I am nothing. I don't know much. All I am is rich.</p>
<p>People just have an idea of making more and more money, but what is it for? How much do I need for any given purposes to my life? In his book, the professor uncovered an important need in modern society: to bring back the idea that money is an instrument rather than the end. Money plays an important role in the material world, but expecting money to give happiness may be missing the meaning of the life.</p>
