<p class="storyTitle">The American Way: Freedom</p>
<p>Ask the average American, "What is the freedom?" You will probably hear, "It's being able to do what I want to do." When Americans think of freedom, they often think of individualism. They see themselves more as individuals than as members of a family or social group.</p>
<p>In American culture, freedom means equality. <i>The Declaration of Independence</i> states that "all men are created equal". That does not mean equal in abilities or status. For Americans, equality refers to equal worth and equal opportunity.</p>
<p>Every individual should have an equal chance to improve his life. True, America has not always lived up to that ideal. For many years, native Americans, African Americans and immigrants have protested the unequal treatment they have received. But American culture still teaches that people can work hard and fulfill their dreams. Whether this idea is true or not, people hear rags-to-riches stories often enough to confirm it in the minds of many people.</p>
<p>Freedom arouses strong feelings for Americans. The idea of liberty binds people together in this "land of the free". However, problems still exist. One individual's freedom can conflict with the rights of others. Someone once said, "You have the freedom to swing your fist around if you want. But your freedom ends where my nose begins." People can also become too concerned about their own rights. They might demand special treatment. However, the path to freedom is not completely smooth. Even so, for Americans, no other road is really worth traveling.</p>
