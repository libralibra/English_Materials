<p class="storyTitle">Plants and Insects</p>
<p>Which came first, the chicken or the egg? This age-old question touches, in another form, on the theory of evolution. Which came first, the plants or the insects, in particular the bees? If the plants came first, they would have had to be plants that could survive without pollination. If, however, they had no need for bees, then there was no need for bees to evolve. Further, if plants were able to survive without bees, there was no need for plants to have a particular color or smell to attract bees, there being no bees to attract.</p>
<p>A bee cannot exist by itself. It needs to be part of a unit, sixty thousand strong. Did one bee originally evolve on his own? Evolution believes that before the bees there were bee-like creatures going through various changes, evolving into what finally and suddenly became a fully developed nest with workers, drones and one queen. If this is so, the question that puzzles anti-evolutionists is how the stages took place and how the creatures survived meanwhile, and was there a stage at which the creatures were half bees and half something else?</p>
<p>But the question here with regard to bees is the question of food. If the bees came first, what did they feed on? Perhaps on some other life forms or, cannibalistically, on one another. There seems to be no record of this but, in this age, there has been a great deal of which there was no previous record, that has suddenly come to light. If bees come before the plants, it is clear that they managed to survive until the appearance of plants, and that whatever their first or original food, they eventually transferred their needs to plants. Equally, if the plants came first they must have had some way of survival that did not require the help of bees. If the evolutionists are right, it may also be that the plants underwent changes and that part of their evolution is concerned with passing from a form that could do without bees to a form that needed them.</p>
<p>Anti-evolutionists will argue that neither needed to come first, that the two could have come into existence side-by-side and interdependently at the same time. But how, your evolutionist will say, could bees just have "come into existence"? There must have been some bee-like insect there before. And if this is so, what did it feed on? At which point we are back to the beginning again with the age-old question: Which came first, the plants or the insects, the chicken or the eggs?</p>
