<p class="storyTitle">Throw Your Pills Away&#151;No Hesitation</p>
<p>Sleeping pills depress the brain and students who take them are less fit for study, or other work, or for driving a car, on the next day, than they would otherwise be. Try to keep up-to-date with your studies and get enough relaxation, especially just before going to bed. If you are fresh and free from worry, and have regular sleeping habits, you should not need sleeping pills. If you seem to take a long time in going to sleep, try to relax so that you can at least benefit from the rest. Let all your muscles relax. Some experts suggest that it is best to think only about relaxing. Alternatively, to take your thoughts away from any current worry, you may prefer to recollect some pleasant experience.</p>
<p>Pep pills stimulate the brain and some people take them to overcome a feeling of tiredness, when they should be trying to relax and go to sleep. It is unwise to take pep pills, when you have already studied for long enough, to help you to stay awake and work longer. Extreme physical tiredness and mental depression may be felt when the effects of the pills wear off, so that they have the opposite to the intended effect. There may then be a temptation to take more pep pills to help overcome the feeling of exhaustion resulting from the previous dose. This is a vicious circle. It is best to plan your work so that you are wide awake all day and ready to sleep at bed-time.</p>
