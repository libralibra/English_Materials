<p class="storyTitle">What Are Good Manners?</p>
<p>People in different countries have different standards for good manners. Before entering a house in some Asian countries it is necessary to take off one's shoes. In European countries, even though shoes sometimes become very muddy, this is not done. A guest in a Chinese house never finishes a drink. He leaves a little to show that he has had enough. In a Malay house, a guest always leaves a little food. In England, a guest always finishes a drink or eats up his food to show that he has enjoyed it.</p>
<p>Here are some examples of the things that a well-mannered person does or does not do no matter whether he is an oriental or a westerner. He never laughs at people when they are in trouble. Instead, he tries to help them. He is always kind whether to people or to animals.</p>
<p>When he is waiting for a bus, he takes his turn and never pushes to the front of the line. In the bus, he gives his seat to an old person, or a disabled person, or a lady who is standing. When talking to people, he never tells heavy people they are fat, but says that they are losing weight for he knows everyone is diet conscious and wants to be thin. He never asks people, women in particular, their age. Everyone wants to be young. If he is invited to a dinner party at seven, he is sure to be there by seven, knowing how people respect time and expect everyone to be "on time". If he smokes, he never lights his cigarette before getting the permission from people around him.</p>
<p>He says "Please" when making a request and "Thank you" when he receives something. He stands up when speaking to a lady or an older person, and he does not sit down until the other person is seated.</p>
