<p class="storyTitle">The Threat of AIDS</p>
<p>WASHINGTON&#151;Nearly 40 million children in developing countries stand to lose one or both parents to AIDS over the next 13 years, and almost 3 million children under 15 have caught disease worldwide, US experts said.</p>
<p>"More than 40 million children in 23 developing nations will likely have lost one or both their parents by 2010. Most of these deaths will be the results of HIV/AIDS and complicated illness," Brain Atwood, a US official said. Meanwhile, since the first reported death of a child by AIDS in Los Angeles 15 years ago, almost 3 million children under 15 are estimated to have caught the disease worldwide, and at least 1&#160;000 dying each day.</p>
<p>"In countries across Africa, Asia and Latin America, HIV/AIDS is pulling years of progress in economic and social development," he added.</p>
<p>"Life expectancy, which has been steadily on the rise for the last 30 years, will drop 40 years or less in nine African countries by the year 2020." Atwood said serious work to help stop children from dying in developing countries was being wiped out.</p>
<p>"In all 23 countries included in this study, AIDS-related death will take away the gains made in child survival over the past 20 years. In Zambia and Zimbabwe, children's death rates will likely nearly double," Atwood said.</p>
