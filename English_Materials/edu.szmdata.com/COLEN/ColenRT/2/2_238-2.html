<p class="storyTitle">How to Advertise for a Bank</p>
<p>Do you know how to advertise for a bank? If you ask people about the functions of a bank, they would probably say that the bank is where you can deposit money and cash a check. But it's much more than these. And we have to tell people this in our advertisement.</p>
<p>There are several things to think about for a bank advertisement. The first problem is to decide who should be our audience. Should our advertisement be aimed at adults with full employment only? Or should it also appeal to students, housewives, retired workers, or even children? It is a good idea to address the largest possible audience. If we introduce the name of our bank to children they will never forget it.</p>
<p>The next question is how to attract people of different social groups to our bank. The usual trick is to offer free gifts. For example, portable radios or T-shirts for the young, and gold pens for business executives. That always works. But what do we give to our best customers? That's another question. What about leather diaries, for example?</p>
<p>Banks are very competitive. We have to think of something new to offer our customers. That's the third problem. Ours is one of the first banks to have drive-in service and to open on Saturdays, but now many banks do. Most banks also offer a variety of checking and savings accounts and a full range of investment plans to suit the needs of their customers, as well as the 24-hour ATM banking which makes it much faster and easier for customers to withdraw cash or do other things. To attract more customers to our bank, it is essential that we have something that no other bank offers.</p>
<p>The last problem is where to put the advertisement. On television, of course, but what about journals and newspapers? Which ones are more suitable? And when and how often? These are also questions we have to ask ourselves about advertising for a bank.</p>
