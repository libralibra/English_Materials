<p class="storyTitle">Diary of an Adoptive Mother</p>
<p>January 1: It has happened. I got a call today saying a little girl in Russia is now my little girl. There is a lot of paperwork to do, and we have to travel to Russia to bring her home, but now it is certain. I think I'll tell some close friends. Jason is so excited. I haven't told Steven yet. How can I tell a seven-year-old that he has a sister who is already five years old?</p>
<p>January 10: Today I received a picture of Katerina. The picture is small and not very clear, but I look at it over and over again. I don't know anything else about her. She has lived in an orphanage for most of her life. I wonder how I will talk to her. I don't speak Russian, and she doesn't speak English.</p>
<p>February 1: Today I showed Katerina's picture to Steven. He is very happy and wants to tell all his friends about his new sister. I want to buy some clothes for Katerina, but I don't know her size. I haven't received any more information from the adoption agency, and I'm feeling a little worried.</p>
<p>February 16: Finally! Today we received good news! All the papers are ready and tomorrow we will go to Russia to bring Katerina home with us.</p>
<p>February 18: Today I met my daughter for the first time. She is very small, very thin, and very afraid. On the way home in the airplane, she slept most of the time. When she woke up, she cried. I am very nervous and hope that I can be a good mother to Katerina.</p>
<p>February 19: Steven met his sister this morning. Although Katerina was shy at first, soon she and Steven began to communicate in a mixture of Russian, English, and hand gestures. Steven and his sister get along well together. In fact, he is able to help her communicate with Jason and me. I am worried about how Katerina will be in school. Next week she will start kindergarten. How will she communicate with the other children? How will she understand her teacher?</p>
<p>March 21: Katerina looks much healthier now. She has gained weight, her hair is shiny, and her skin is clear. She loves to watch television with her brother, and she has learned to roller skate. She is doing well in school, and her English gets better every day. Although she sometimes looks sad, and sometimes cries, most of the time she is happy. I think she is slowly getting used to her new life with us. After only three months, I can't imagine my life without her.</p>
