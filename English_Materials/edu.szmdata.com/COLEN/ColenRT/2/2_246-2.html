<p class="storyTitle">Effects of Global Warming</p>
<p>Global warming could cause drought and possibly famine in India, a new report predicts. Some cities could also be at risk from flooding as sea levels rose. The report recommends building sea-walls around low-lying areas such as the new port and airport reclamations.</p>
<p>By 2050 about 30 to 40 percent of the country will experience changes in the type of plants it supports. In many places it will be too dry to grow crops such as rice. The growing season also is expected to alter, becoming shorter in southern and central India. The rapid changes make it unlikely that plants could adapt.</p>
<p>India will produce smaller crops. In the central and northern areas, and the southern part, there will be decreased production because of water limitations. Famine could result because of the demands of feeding the population&#151;particularly if it grows&#151;and the diminished productivity of the land. It looks very difficult for the world as a whole.</p>
<p>Global warming is caused by the burning of large amounts of fossil fuels, such as coal and oil, which release gases that trap heat in the atmosphere. World temperatures already have increased last century by about 0.7 degrees Celsius and will rise by between 1.6 degrees and 3.8 degrees by 2100. India should take the problem seriously.</p>
<p>Food supplies, for instance, could be affected by lower crop yields. Maybe we could afford to import food from elsewhere but you have to keep in mind that the type of changes experienced in southern India will take place elsewhere as well. Sea levels could rise as a huge mass of ice melted and the higher temperatures expanded the size of the oceans, threatening much of some cities which is built on reclaimed land. Sea levels worldwide will rise by 15 to 90 centimeters by 2100, depending on whether action is taken to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
<p>Depleted fresh water supplies would be another problem because increased evaporation would reduce levels. The general outlook could be helped if the cities used water less wastefully and encouraged energy efficiency to reduce fuel-burning. The West is called on to help India improve its efficiency.</p>
