<p class="storyTitle">Guns in School</p>
<p>More than 6&#160;000 children were expelled from US school last year for bringing guns and bombs to school, the US Department of Education said on May 8.</p>
<p>The department gave a report to the expulsions as saying handguns accounted for 58 percent of the 6&#160;093 expulsions in 1996-1997, against 7 percent for rifles or shotguns and 35 percent for other types of firearms.</p>
<p>"The report is a clear sign that our nation's public schools are cracking down on students who bring guns to school," Education Secretary Richard Riley said in a statement. "We need to be tough-minded about keeping guns out of our schools and do everything to keep our children safe."</p>
<p>In March 1997, an 11-year-old boy and a 13-year-old boy using handguns and rifles shot dead four children and a teacher at a school in Jonesboro, Arkansas. In October, two were killed and seven wounded in a shooting at a Mississippi school. Two months later, a 14-year-old boy killed three high school students and wounded five in Paducah, Kentucky.</p>
<p>Most of the expulsions, 56 percent, were from high school, which have students from about age 13. Among the expulsions, 34 percent were from junior high schools and 9 percent were from elementary schools, the report said.</p>
