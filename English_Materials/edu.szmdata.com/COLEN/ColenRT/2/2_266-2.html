<p class="storyTitle">Tips</p>
<p>The porter (a person who helps carry baggage) brings your bags to your room and helpfully explains all you want to know. Then he points to the phone and says: "If there's anything else you need, just call." All this time you have been thinking one thing: "How much should I tip him?" To make your next trip a little easier, here's a guide to tipping across some Asian countries.</p>
<p class="subTitle">Bangkok</p>
<p>In general, the more Westernized the place is, the more likely you will be expected to leave a tip. Some top-end restaurants will add a 10% service charge to the bill. If not, waiters will appreciate your tacking on the 10% yourself. However, if you're eating at a lower-end restaurant, a tip is not necessary. If you're staying at one of Bangkok's many five-star hotels, expect to tip the porter 20 to 50 baht, depending on how many hags you have. Taxis are now metered in Bangkok. Local custom is to round the fare up to the nearest five baht.</p>
<p class="subTitle">Hong Kong</p>
<p>Tipping is customary in this money-mad metropolis. Most restaurants add a 10% service charge to the bill, but the extra money often ends up in the pocket of the owner. If the service is good, add another 10% to the bill, up to HK$20 bill may be more acceptable. When in a taxi, round up to the nearest dollar.</p>
<p class="subTitle">Kuala Lumpur</p>
<p>Tipping in Malaysia is limited to the expensive Westernized hotels, which often add a 10% service charge to your meal or hotel room. If you are at a hotel restaurant, expect a 10% service charge. But at local restaurants, there's no need to add a tip. At a five-star hotel, one or two ringgit will content a porter. At lower end buildings don't feel you have to tip. Like Bangkok, many taxis are now metered so you can just round up to the nearest ringgit.</p>
<p class="subTitle">Seoul</p>
<p>Tipping is not part of Korean culture, although it has become a matter of course in international hotels where a 10% service charge is often added. If you're at a Korean barbecue joint, there's no need to add anything extra. But a nice Italian restaurant may require a 10% contribution. If you're at a top-end hotel, expect to pay 500-1&#160;000 won per bag. Taxi drivers don't accept a tip. Keep the change for yourself.</p>
