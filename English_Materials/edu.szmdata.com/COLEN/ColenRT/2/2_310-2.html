<p class="storyTitle">The Advantages of Television</p>
<p>It is an acknowledged fact that television is a great invention of the modern times. It has had a great impact on society. It has also become a natural feature of modern living.</p>
<p>Because of its audio-visual nature, television has several advantages. In the first place it is a great educator. Films, especially documentary ones which depict events and conditions in other parts of the world greatly increase our general knowledge. Spectacular events like man's exploration of the moon can be telecast. So, too, can live performances of great stars be screened.</p>
<p>Nowadays, television is increasing in importance as a medium of instruction. In Hong Kong, the Educational Television series serves to encourage more learning. Children and students find it easier to learn the lessons that are viewed over TV, because they actually see the thing working and hear it at the same time. It is also more interesting this way. Besides this, pupils can also increase their store of knowledge through special technical or academic programs. In large schools or universities, closed-circuit television is now used to educate the masses.</p>
<p>At the same time commercial television is also increasing in importance. This means the screening of advertisements before and after programs. These advertisements serve to provide information of goods and services. In addition, commercial television has helped to cut down the cost of television charges and also enables the presentation of better programs through sponsorship.</p>
<p>During leisure time, television provides good entertainment at home. Office workers after a hard day's work can sit back comfortably and enjoy their favorite movie. Some programs like the language-teaching programs are highly instructive to the general public.</p>
