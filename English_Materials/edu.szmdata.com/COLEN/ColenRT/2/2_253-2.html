<p class="storyTitle">Leaving Tips</p>
<p>Leaving a tip in a restaurant has become a custom in most countries. The word "tip" came from the Latin word "Gratis", meaning free. Tips are defined as small gifts of money for service in addition to the payment due.</p>
<p>Believe it or not, the practice of tipping has a little interesting history. The custom can be traced back to the Roman era. The Romans were the first civilization to use coins. It is possible that the word "tip" came from the word <i>stipend</i>. <i>Stips</i> in Latin means gift. A more common belief is tips were first given in the 18th century England. A popular coffee house equipped each table with a coin box. The label of each box read: "To insure promptness." Dropping a coin into the box would result in quick service. Also, the first letter of each word is T.I.P.&#151;tip.</p>
<p>In America and Europe it is customary to tip anywhere from 10% to 20%. Taxi drivers, waiters in restaurants, waitresses in lounges, hotel boys, doormen, and disco coat check girls, all expect a little something. People working at these jobs usually receive a low basic salary. Tips are quite necessary to supplement their income. Today most people decide the size of tip according to the quality of the service. If the service and food are not satisfactory, a small tip or possibly no tip will be left. For excellent food and service most people are quite happy to leave a tip.</p>
<p>The world is full of big spenders and people who act like big spenders. Surprisingly, rich people are not "big tippers" unless entertaining guests. It is no use showing off if nobody is there to watch, right? Many throw money around like water to impress a group of friends out for an evening "on the town". People who usually cannot afford it are the biggest tippers in front of their friends. It is all part of the show to prove a certain level of social success. Nobody wants to look cheap, stingy, or poor in front of their friends. Over-tipping also gives some satisfaction just to see the waiter's reaction.</p>
<p>For whatever reason, tipping will continue to be practiced in most countries. Tipping does have its place in our modern society. It will also remain a somewhat personal expression of gratitude.</p>
