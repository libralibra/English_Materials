<p class="storyTitle">London Taxi Drivers</p>
<p>London taxi drivers know the capital like the back of their hands. Just jump into one of the city's 22&#160;000 distinctive shaped cars and tell the driver your destination. No matter how small and obscure the street is, the driver will be able to get you there without any trouble.</p>
<p>The reason why London taxi drivers are so efficient is that they have all gone through a very rough training period known as "the knowledge" to get the special license needed to drive taxi. During this period, which can take from two to four years, the would-be taxi driver has to learn the most direct route to every single road and to every important building in London. To achieve this, most learners go around the city on small motorbikes, practicing how to move to and from different points of the city.</p>
<p>Going around London on a small motorbike can have its problems, particularly during the winter. Collin Sinclair, 40, who has been a taxi driver for 15 years, described his training period as a time of blood, sweat and tears. "There was thick snow everywhere and I had to wear my mother's tights because I was so cold," he said.</p>
<p>Learner taxi drivers are tested several times during their training period by government officers. Sinclair thought his exams were a nerve racking experience. "The officers ask you, 'How do you get from Buckingham Palace to the Tower of London?' and you have to take them there in a very direct line. When you get to the Tower, they will quickly move on to the next question. After five or six questions, they'll just say, 'See you in two months time,' and then you know the exam is over."</p>
