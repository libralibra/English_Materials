<p class="storyTitle">Amy Johnson</p>
<p>Amy Johnson was a very ambitious and energetic person. She didn't have much in common with other girls in her school, however. She played football better than most boys, and unfortunately she made a rather bad impression on many of her teachers. Amy just didn't act the way they thought a girl should. She studied at a university and later took a job as a typist. Although she was enthusiastic and did her best, she made many mistakes and was poorly paid. She didn't want to be a typist anyway&#151;she dreamed of becoming a pilot!</p>
<p>Amy moved to London, borrowed some money, and learned to fly. Nobody, however, wanted to hire a female pilot. She decided to fly alone to Australia to prove that she could fly as well as any man. Her parents lent her money to buy an airplane.</p>
<p>Amy set off on May 5, 1930. Her route took her over Vienna, Constantinople, and Baghdad. She was caught in a sandstorm and had to make an emergency landing in the desert. But she landed in India six days later. She had broken the record to India by two days. Over Burma she ran into a monsoon, and was able to save herself only by landing on a football field. She finally reached Australia. The plane propeller had been broken during her last landing, and she had to crash-land. But Amy had proved that she could fly&#151;and that a woman could do almost anything she really put her mind to.</p>
<p>Amy Johnson later married the pilot who had come to her rescue in Australia.</p>
