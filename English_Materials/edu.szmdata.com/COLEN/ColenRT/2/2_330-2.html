<p class="storyTitle">The Do It Homestead</p>
<p>Charlie and Fran Collins live in southwest Utah on the family farm which they built together. For the last 21 years, the Collinses have not paid any electrical bills. They have run their home and their farm completely on solar energy. They do not depend on electrical companies to supply their power.</p>
<p>Many people dream of becoming energy self-sufficient for different reasons. Some people want to use energy sources that are safer for the environment, or environmentally friendly. However, while most of us only dream about becoming energy self-sufficient, Charlie and Fran Collins actually did it. When the Collinses bought their 240-acre farm they began experimenting with various sources of light and energy. After 21 years, they have a lifestyle that has all of the modern conveniences, but which is powered entirely on solar energy. The Collinses call their home "The Do It Homestead", because Charlie and Fran understood that if they wanted to get anything done, they had to "DO IT" themselves.</p>
<p>Using 24 solar electric panels, the Collinses produce enough electricity to meet their needs for three to five days with no sunlight. They run lights, a solar refrigerator/freezer, and other household appliances, such as a dishwasher, washing machine, and vacuum cleaner.</p>
<p>Charlie's dream is to help others become as self-reliant as he and his wife are on their Utah homestead. He is the author of <i>Ask Mr. Solar</i>, a popular newspaper column that answers people's questions about solar energy. Charlie and Fran Collins also teach a college course about solar energy through the Internet. For people who are interested in alternative energy, the Collinses are experienced sources of information. The knowledge they have can be invaluable to anyone who dreams of providing power to their homes without having to pay monthly electric bills.</p>
