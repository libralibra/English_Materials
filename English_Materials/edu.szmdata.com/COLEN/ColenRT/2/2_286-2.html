<p class="storyTitle">A Passport to Bright Future</p>
<p>The US Department of Labor statistics indicate that there is an oversupply of college-trained workers and that this oversupply is increasing. Already there is an overabundance of teachers, engineers, physicists and other specialists. Yet colleges and graduate schools continue every year to turn out highly trained people to compete for jobs that aren't there. The result is that graduates cannot enter the professions for which they were trained and must take temporary jobs which do not require a college degree. These "temporary" jobs have a habit of becoming permanent.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there is a tremendous need for skilled workers of all sorts: carpenters, electricians, mechanicians, and TV repairmen. These people have more work than they can handle and their annual incomes are often higher than those of college graduates. The old distinction that white-collar workers make a better living than blue-collar workers no longer holds true.</p>
<p>The reason for this situation is the traditional myth that a college degree is a passport to bright future. Parents begin telling their children this myth before they are out of school. Under this pressure the kids fall in line. Whether they want to go to college or not doesn't matter. Everybody should go to college.</p>
<p>One result of this emphasis on a college education is that many people go to college who do not belong there. Of the sixty percent of high school graduates who enter college, half of them do not graduate with their class. Many of them drop out within the first year. Some struggle on for two or three years and then they give up.</p>
