<p class="storyTitle">Hunger</p>
<p>Hunger around the world can be reduced 50 percent by the end of the 1990's. That is the conclusion of scientists and others who met in Bellagio, Italy, several months ago. The people at the meeting were experts on hunger. They reported that at least five hundred million persons in the world suffer from hunger. They noted that several nations still have severe shortages of food. But, the experts said, there is progress. For example, China and India have reduced hunger sharply in recent years, and studies have shown which methods work best at reducing hunger in other parts of the world. The experts meeting in Italy urged public officials and aid groups to take four steps to reduce hunger.</p>
<p>The first step is to end mass hunger of famine. They said neutral international organizations should protect civilian food supplies in areas at war. They also said nations should improve their methods of sending food to emergency locations.</p>
<p>The second step is to produce more food for the world's poorest families. The best way is with more modern farming methods. The green revolution made it possible for India and other nations to greatly increase harvests, yet these farming methods are far from perfect. They do not work everywhere, and they can cause environmental damage. They also must create programs that bring food directly to the very poor.</p>
<p>The third step is to protect mothers and young children against food shortages. The experts said mothers and young children suffer the most from hunger. Many lives can be saved by making sure they are the first to get assistance.</p>
<p>Finally, the experts urged efforts to overcome two serious medical problems linked to food shortages. The first is a lack of iodine. One hundred ninety million persons suffer from goiter and other illnesses because they get too little iodine. The other problem is even more widespread. It is a lack of vitamin A. Both iodine and vitamin A can be supplied.</p>
<p>The experts meeting in Bellagio, Italy, said taking these four steps would cut world hunger in half by the beginning of the next century.</p>
