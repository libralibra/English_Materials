<p class="storyTitle">Unlucky in Love</p>
<p>During the war, a fighter pilot was shot down over enemy occupied territory. Fortunately, he was saved from his burning plane by a group of nuns from a nearby convent. He had been knocked unconscious during the crash landing, and when he came to, he was astonished to find a woman leaning over him.</p>
<p>It was Sister Maria, the nun in charge. She said to the pilot, "This convent is a teaching hospital. We have many young girls here, learning how to be nurses. We will hide you here as long as possible, but you will have to obey very strict rules."</p>
<p>The pilot agreed to disguise himself as a nurse. He was not allowed to talk with either the nuns or the nurses. He had to stay in his small room as much as possible. By shaving twice a day, wearing a wig and a nurse's uniform, he was able to fool anyone at a distance. It was a difficult life, however. He grew very lonely, especially when one of the nursing students caught his eye. She was very quiet and shy, turning away whenever she saw him glancing her way. The pilot fell in love with her, and thought of her constantly.</p>
<p>One day the pilot could stand it no longer. He found the nurse working in the kitchen. He crossed over to her and said, "Please don't turn away. I've fallen in love with you." He started to put his arms round the nurse. The nurse then said something that made the pilot step back in astonishment.</p>
