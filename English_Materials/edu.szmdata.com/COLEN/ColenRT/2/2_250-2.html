<p class="storyTitle">For Rent</p>
<p>Last week as my husband and I were driving near the beach, we noticed a small house with a "For Rent" sign. We went onto the front porch and knocked at the door, but no one answered, so we walked down the steps and around to the rear of the house. There we found a small yard surrounded by a fence with an old metal gate.</p>
<p>Because the house was empty, we decided to take a look inside. We looked in one of the windows near the back porch and saw that the inside was dusty but in generally good condition. The walls and floors were in perfect condition. The only thing that needed repair was the ceiling in the kitchen, which had been damaged by some rain water.</p>
<p>While we were looking, a neighbor came over to see who we were. The house belonged to him so he was able to take us inside. There was a total of six rooms, and all but the kitchen had carpeting. The house was unfurnished, but there were still several pictures hanging in one of the rooms. In general, the house looked wonderful.</p>
<p>The landlord explained to us that the rent was $350 per month, due by the fifth day of each month, and that usually he required a deposit equal to one month's rent. However, if we would repair the ceiling, he would not charge us the deposit. The idea sounded very good, so my husband and I went home to discuss things. We decided to take it.</p>
