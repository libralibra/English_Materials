<p class="storyTitle">Children and Smoking</p>
<p>Children exposed to smoke in their homes have more colds, flu, and pneumonia and miss 7 million more school days than other kids, a major study shows.</p>
<p>Researchers for the Federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, interviewed the parents of 17&#160;488 children aged 1 to 10.</p>
<p>"Secondhand smoke exposure has never been studied in such a large number of children before. This is the first nationally representative sample," says David Mannino, CDC, Atlanta. Based on their sample, representing 33.7 million children, Mannino and colleagues estimate 10.5 million (31.2%) are exposed to cigarette smoke in the home daily and another 2 million (5.8%) are exposed less often.</p>
<p>Results in the <i>Journal Tobacco Control</i> show that 10.5 million children are exposed to smoke every day:</p>
<p>"Miss 28 million school days, a third more than kids not exposed to smoke at home."</p>
<p>"Have 1.7 million more colds and acute respiratory infections, 10% more than unexposed kids. One infection can account for multiple days of illness."</p>
<p>"Have 102 million days of restricted activities, such as missing sports practice after school, 21% more than unexposed kids."</p>
<p>The study also shows exposure varies by region. Nearly 40% of Midwestern parents expose their children to tobacco smoke, while 24% of California parents do.</p>
<p>Rates also vary by income and education levels: 48% of children in homes with low levels are exposed vs.25% in homes with high levels.</p>
<p>Says Mannino: "Children exposed to secondhand smoke in their homes simply spend more time sick. The best prevention is not to let smokers smoke in your house."</p>
