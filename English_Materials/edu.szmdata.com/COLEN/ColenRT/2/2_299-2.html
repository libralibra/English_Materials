<p class="storyTitle">Television in the Future</p>
<p>In the future, television communications will serve many significant functions in the home. Already we have cassette tapes of programs, and we are able to use the home screen to play games such as electronic tennis and tic-tac-toe. Eventually, students might prefer to talk to an instructor on television through special attachments to their home sets, and this could mean the end of public schools as we know them.</p>
<p>Most of all, television will become a place for creative ideas. Instead of passively watching programs the way we do now, new developments will allow us to participate in shows and to feel and sense directly the emotions of the actors we watch. Also, there will be methods that will let us shape and create our own shows. We may even be able to press a button and have our own light show displayed on the screen. We will be able to think of an image and see that image flash on the screen in front of us. Different people in different places will be able to exchange ideas through television and even to interrupt and comment on shows for the benefit of performers in the television studio.</p>
<p>Television is a necessary part of our technological future. Now is the time for us to consider it as a responsibility, so that, when the new inventions make it more interesting to watch television, our own ideas and creative talents will be ready and waiting to make the technology of television more beneficial for all.</p>
