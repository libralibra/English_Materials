<p class="storyTitle">Synonyms</p>
<p>English is a language particularly rich in synonyms, that is, different words which stand for the same thing. This is partly because of the convention, particularly in written English, that one should avoid repeating the same word over and over again. So instead of repeating "enough" one may substitute "sufficient", instead of repeating "everlasting" one may use "never-ending". No two words are exactly identical, however. It is usually possible to find some differences between them or some context in which one is appropriate but not the other. Such differences can take several forms. It may be a difference in regional variety. "Autumn" and "fall", for example, both refer to the same season, but one is used in British English, the other in American English. Similarly, "snack" and "baggin" both refer to a light meal, but the former is standard English and the latter is a regional variety from the north of England. There may be stylistic differences. "Salt" and "sodium chloride" are synonymous, but the former is an everyday expression, and the latter is technical. Similarly, "recalcitrant" is a formal equivalent of "disobedient". There may also be differences in the emotional associations of words. "Youths" and "youngsters" are synonymous, but "youths" sound less pleasant than youngsters. The emotional associations which a word brings to mind will often differ from person to person, so are to some degree unpredictable. Thus, calling someone a "republican" may suggest he has praiseworthy qualities to those in England who wish to abolish the monarchy, but carry hateful characteristics to those who support it.</p>
