<p class="storyTitle">Living on My Own</p>
<p>The first time I decided to leave home was when I was a sophomore in high school. I was having trouble getting along with my parents. I had about a hundred dollars in my pocket, and so I thought about leaving home. It took me only three weeks away from home when I started to feel homesick. Living on my own is a totally different experience for three main reasons: being more responsible, more decisive and more creative.</p>
<p>First of all, I have learned that living on my own requires that I become more responsible. My parents usually assign my work and duties which I have to keep up with almost every day. When I fail to do my assigned work, I only get scolded. However, now that I am on my own, I get to deal with my duties without being told to. When I fail to do my duties, I must also deal with the outcome on my own.</p>
<p>Another different experience for me while living on my own is that now I have become more decisive. I have to be more careful now that I am on my own because my parents are not here to give me their advice. I must make my own decisions now that I am on my own. For example, I must make the best decisions for myself without hurting anybody's feelings and without my parents' authority.</p>
<p>Therefore, I became more creative just by living on my own. I could make my own future plan. I have made rules for myself to follow. I also designed all the furniture in my room by using carving tools. I wrote a lot of songs and kept them in my notebook for any singer out there who might be interested. This to me is a good experience, because I usually think that being creative is the nicest thing in the world. However, when I was with my parents I found it hard for me to be creative simply because I always followed their ideas.</p>
<p>In conclusion, these are the things that usually happen when I am with my parents and when I am alone. In addition, I think that it is appropriate for everyone in this world to love their parents and themselves before they love anyone else. They should learn how to live on their own, but at the same time learn how to support their loving parents. They need to follow every technique that was given to them by their parents. They can make use of their freedom of choice to lead to wherever they want.</p>
