<p class="storyTitle">Making Purchases Intelligently</p>
<p>Everybody has to buy or sell things sometimes. Even students, who are usually not very rich, have to learn something about making purchases intelligently. As a student you may find, for example, that you need to buy a typewriter or winter clothing. You may want to buy a television or a used car. Of course, you want to get good value for your money. If you are considering a major purchase, or any purchase, you should remember two important things.</p>
<p>1. Study first, and then decide what you want to buy. You can learn a lot just by reading books and advertisements.</p>
<p>Remember that a high quality product will probably last longer and work better. Of course, for a superior product you can expect to pay more. An inferior product may not give you the same quality, but the price should be low. Perhaps this seems obvious, but you must know the quality. Don't just look at the price. A poor quality product could be expensive. And a valuable one could be on sale at a greatly reduced price.</p>
<p>2. Don't hurry. Take your time. After you decide what product you want, go to many different stores. If you cannot find the product you want, you may try to order it directly from the factory or ask the store to order it for you.</p>
<p>Look for a good deal. If you wait, you will probably find that your product will go on sale and you may be able to save 10, 20, or even 50 percent off the original price.</p>
<p>Finally, before you buy, make sure that the product is guaranteed. If you don't like it, you want to be able to get your money back.</p>
<p>If you carefully examine your own preferences and then shop until you find the lowest possible price, you will generally be happy with your purchase and also keep more money in the bank.</p>
