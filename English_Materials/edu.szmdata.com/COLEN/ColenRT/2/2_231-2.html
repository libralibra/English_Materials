<p class="storyTitle">Small Cars and Large Cars</p>
<p>Most Europeans want small cars. Many Americans prefer large cars. As a result, European auto-makers produce a wide variety of economical, lightweight cars while American auto-makers tend to build bigger, heavier cars.</p>
<p>The price of gasoline has much to do with this. Gasoline is expensive in Europe, so Europeans naturally prefer cars that will go a long way on a small amount of fuel.</p>
<p>Other reasons also enter into the big or small car decision. Many Old World cities have very narrow, winding streets. In these cities a small car is more practical and easier to handle than a large one.</p>
<p>Some Americans like powerful engines in their cars. They enjoy having roomy cars that are comfortable for large families and long trips. They are prepared to pay higher operating costs to get these advantages.</p>
<p>Other Americans, however, have learned to like the small, nimble cars. Many visitors to Europe during and after World War II discovered that small cars were fun to drive and easy to park in small spaces. They were delighted to learn how far small cars could go on a few gallons of gasoline.</p>
<p>In the 1950's many Americans began buying European cars. In 1957, for the first time, the United States imported more cars than it exported. The best seller among these imported cars was an odd-looking but dependable small car from Germany. Americans promptly nicknamed it "the bug".</p>
<p>Today, American car buyers have a wide choice. There are big cars for people who want elbow room, comfort, and power. And there are small cars, mostly imported but some American-made, for people who want easy parking and economical operation.</p>
