<p class="storyTitle">Modern Libraries</p>
<p>Like business and industry, the academic world is changing as technology advances. Libraries are one place where we see changes. Many innovative things are happening in both public and university libraries. Libraries are using new equipment and techniques for research, and librarians are teaching students the new techniques.</p>
<p>One service that some university libraries are now providing is a computer search of materials for students doing research. Before starting a research project, students check with their library to see if a computer search is worthwhile. This kind of search cannot help with all research projects, but it can save time if the topic is in the computer's database. When you are doing a manual search for a research paper, you look at all the indexes appropriate to the research topic. You look up the words related to the topic in the indexes. It takes many hours to look up this information and write down the references. A computer search is faster and easier. You and a librarian decide on the words to enter the computer. Then the computer looks for these words in this database and gives you a list of references for your topic. A computer can take two or more ideas and produce references that combine those ideas. A computer search can also be more complete than a manual search.</p>
<p>College and university libraries are providing other technological services as well. Another change is the frequent use of microfilm. Librarians are able to collect more materials in one building by having newspapers, magazines, and other documents on microfilm. Students use microfilm readers in the library for these materials.</p>
<p>These innovations in libraries are helpful to library users, but they are also expensive. Many libraries are facing budget problems. There is more technology available today; as a result, libraries are paying higher costs for the equipment that makes research easier.</p>
