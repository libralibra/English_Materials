<p class="storyTitle">Marathon of Hope</p>
<p>When Terry Fox was 18, cancer was discovered in his right leg and it was amputated. Three years later Terry Fox began a 5&#160;432 miles (8&#160;691 km) run across Canada on just one leg. He called his run, a "Marathon of Hope". He hoped to raise $100&#160;000 for cancer research through this run.</p>
<p>Terry Fox never finished his run. He ran 3&#160;400 miles (5&#160;440 km) before he had to stop. He died from cancer on June 29, 1981. Before he died, he raised more than $23 million and had given hope to millions of people around the world.</p>
<p>Mr. Fox began his run in April 1980, from St. John's, Newfoundland. In May, he boarded a ferry and continued his run through Nova Scotia and New Brunswick. He crossed into Quebec by mid-June, then followed the St. Lawrence River south. Terry Fox reached Ottawa, the capital of Canada on July 1 and met the Prime Minister of Canada there.</p>
<p>Several weeks later, Terry Fox reached Toronto. Toronto is 220 miles (352 km) from Ottawa. There, Mr. Fox told a crowd of people that his run was painful and exhausting. But, he added, "My run is not nearly as hard as the struggle faced by hundreds of cancer patients in this country."</p>
<p>Terry Fox reached Thunder Bay, Ontario, in September. He was forced to end his marathon run there. Doctors had discovered cancer in his lungs. In January 1981, cancer was discovered in his stomach. On June 19, Terry Fox went into the hospital for the last time. When he died, the Canadian government lowered its flags to half-mast. This is an honor that is normally used to mark the death of important politicians and world leaders.</p>
<p>Between September 1980 and June 29, 1981, $23 million was donated to the Canadian Cancer Society in Terry Fox's name. It was donated by people from all over the world. Terry Fox was given the highest honor of the Canadian government. He was also named Canadian of the Year 1980.</p>
<p>In memory of Terry Fox, Prime Minister Trudeau said, "Canadians mourn the passing of a young man whose courage and determination inspired this country as no one else's has ever done." He said that Mr. Fox's run gave "help and hope to others".</p>
