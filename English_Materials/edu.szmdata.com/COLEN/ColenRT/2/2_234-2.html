<p class="storyTitle">Jogging</p>
<p>Every day, in all kinds of weather, many thousands of men and women jog. Why has jogging&#151;running slowly for long distances&#151;become so popular? Most joggers begin because they hear it is very good exercise. Jogging makes the heart stronger and helps people lose weight. It can also help them feel better about themselves.</p>
<p>Donald Robbins, who is forty-two years old and works in an office, began jogging a few years ago because he felt he was too fat. At first he could only run about 100 yards. It took him three months to be able to run a mile. But two years later, he ran in a marathon race&#151;over twenty-six miles. Many joggers, like Donald Robbins, feel that if they can succeed in jogging, they can also succeed in other things, and quite often this feeling helps them at their jobs.</p>
<p>Should you jog too? If you do, be sure to ask your doctor for advice. Jogging may be too much exercise for you.</p>
<p>Does jogging cost much? No, it costs almost nothing. But it is very important to have a good pair of shoes that were made especially for jogging. They protect your feet and legs from the shock of running on hard surfaces.</p>
<p>How fast should you go? Jog with a friend and talk to each other as you run. If you have difficulty talking, you're going too fast.</p>
<p>How far should you jog? Remember not to go too far too soon. In fact, you should walk, not run, the first few times. Then do some short jogs, but no more than what you can do comfortably. After that, increase your distance a quarter or half mile every two weeks or so. Maybe in a few years, you can even run in a marathon. Thousands of people do.</p>
