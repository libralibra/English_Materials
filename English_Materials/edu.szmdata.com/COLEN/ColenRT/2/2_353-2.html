<p class="storyTitle">Bonsai</p>
<p>The art of growing dwarf trees, or "bonsai" as their Japanese creators call them, is increasing in popularity in the United States. Growing bonsai can make a fascinating hobby for anyone who enjoys plants and creating beautiful effects with them; elaborate equipment isn't required to grow these lovely and tiny trees, but time, patience, and a sense of natural beauty are.</p>
<p>There are four guidelines to follow in growing bonsai. First, one must be careful in choosing the type of tree. Not all species of trees can be made into bonsai, since the growing conditions are unusual. Varieties of pine with small needles and hardwood trunks are especially suitable.</p>
<p>Second, one must be careful in choosing the size of the container the bonsai will be in. This is necessary because the major growth of bonsai is kept confined to the tree's trunk and leaves, not its root system&#151;a process quite unlike what is done with other plants.</p>
<p>Another thing the bonsai-grower must do is to trim the roots and branches of the tree periodically. Unless this is done, the plants will not have the proper proportions and will look unnatural. The Japanese ideal for bonsai is to have trees which are just like normal trees in everything but size.</p>
<p>The last thing one must do is to be careful to keep the miniature trees well-watered. Because bonsai are grown in smaller-than-usual containers, they often need more water than ordinary houseplants do.</p>
<p>As one can see from the above, the art of bonsai-growing is one which requires a certain amount of time and effort. The satisfactions that growing bonsai brings can be great, however. Imagine a stately pine tree, 100 years old, standing two feet high; imagine having such a tree in your living room and passing it down through several generations of your family. That is actually what bonsai-growing is all about: establishing a tradition of beauty which lasts for years and years and is a symbol of the beauties of the natural world.</p>
