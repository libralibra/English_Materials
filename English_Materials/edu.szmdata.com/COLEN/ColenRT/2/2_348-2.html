<p class="storyTitle">London&#151;Paris</p>
<p>LONDON&#151;A morning's train is riding away, across the Channel, English kids talking about Liverpool's soccer team in a Paris pub.</p>
<p>Some Parisians have even started to go to work in London.</p>
<p>In the 19th century, Charles Dickens compared the two great rival cities, London and Paris, in <i>A Tale of Two Cities</i>. These days, it might be A Tale of One City.</p>
<p>Parisians are these days likely to smile in sympathy at a visitor's broken French and respond in polite English.</p>
<p>As jobs grew lack at home over recent years, perhaps 250&#160;000 Frenchmen moved across the Channel. With an undersea tunnel, they could travel between cities in three hours. The European Union freed them from immigration and customs.</p>
<p>Paris, rich in beauty, is more attractive. But London feels more full of life, and more fun until the pubs shut down.</p>
<p>"For me, the difference is that London is real, alive," said Trevor Wheeler, a banker.</p>
<p>Chantal Jaouen, a professional designer, agrees. "I am French, but I'll stay in London," she said.</p>
<p>There is, of course, the other view. Julie Lenoux is a student who moved to London two years ago. "I think people laugh more in Paris," she said.</p>
<p>In fact, London and Paris, with their obvious new similarities, are beyond the old descriptions. As the European Union gradually loosened controls, Londoners flocked into Paris to shop, eat and buy property.</p>
<p>"Both cities have changed beyond recognition," said Larry Collins, a writer and sometimes a Londoner.</p>
<p>Like most people who know both well, he finds the two now fit together comfortably.</p>
<p>"I first fell in love with Paris in the 1950's, and it is still a wonderful place," Collins said.</p>
<p>"But if I had to choose, it would be London. Things are so much more ordered and life is better."</p>
<p>But certainly not cheaper.</p>
<p>In fancy parts of London, rents can be twice those on Avenue Foch in Paris.</p>
<p>Deciding between London and Paris requires a lifestyle choice.</p>
<p>Like Daphne Benoit, a French journalism student with perfect English, many young people are happy to be close enough so they don't have to choose.</p>
<p>"I love Paris, my little neighborhood, the way I can walk around a centre, but life is so structured," she said. "In London, you can be who you want. No one cares."</p>
