<p class="storyTitle">John Russell</p>
<p>John Russell, 83, got on a Chicago bus and saw a sign saying that senior citizens could ride for half fare. When he dropped his three quarters in the box, the driver demanded identification. John took out an ID card. "You need a special CTA card," said the driver. John did not have the Chicago Transit Authority card because he fives in New York and was in Chicago visiting his two sons.</p>
<p>"Put in another three quarters," said the driver, "or get off the bus."</p>
<p>One privilege of old age is being stubborn. John said, "Give me back my quarters, and I'll get off."</p>
<p>"I can't&#151;it's in the box. If you don't get off, I'll call the police," said he, which he did. Two police cars pulled up.</p>
<p>"I'm the criminal," said John Russell. Then he and the driver told their stories. "That's what you called me for?" one policeman asked the driver. Another policeman then said to John, "I'll give you three quarters."</p>
<p>John shook his head, "Why should you give me the quarters? He has to give me my quarters."</p>
<p>"Where are you going?" asked the policeman.</p>
<p>"Downtown to have lunch with friends," John said.</p>
<p>"Come on," the policemen said. "We'll get you your card." So they took him downtown to the CTA office. But the people there wouldn't give him a CTA card&#151;he needed a picture.</p>
<p>"What about his quarters?" one policeman asked. The officials discussed, and the decision was made to give John's quarters back.</p>
<p>When John got downstairs, the policemen asked where he was going.</p>
<p>"To see my friends," John said.</p>
<p>"How are you going to get there?"</p>
<p>"On the bus. And all I'm going to pay is 75 cents."</p>
<p>"Good luck," the policemen said.</p>
<p>John got on a bus, dropped three quarters in the box, and said, "I'm a senior citizen&#160;...&#160;" The driver looked at John and nodded. He didn't know how lucky he was to be a sensible man.</p>
