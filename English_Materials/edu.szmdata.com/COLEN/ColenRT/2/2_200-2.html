<p class="storyTitle">Maintaining Body Health</p>
<p>Maintaining body health is one of the most important tasks in life. A healthy body requires nutritional foods and liquids for growth, development, and defense against disease. A healthy body also requires fresh air, exercise, and rest.</p>
<p>Maintaining body health requires conscious effort. You choose the foods you eat. You choose whether you get fresh air and exercise. You choose how much rest you get.</p>
<p>Nutrition is one of the most important components of body health. When people do not eat enough food or do not take in certain essential nutrients, they can suffer from malnutrition. Sometimes, disease robs the body of the essential nutrients in the diet. This condition is called secondary malnutrition. Sometimes a diet contains too many otherwise necessary nutrients, such as too many calories which may lead to heart and blood vessel disease The key is to keep to a proper diet.</p>
<p>Three essentials which make foods are carbohydrates, fats, and proteins. Carbohydrates provide body fuel. Fats are stored in the body for future energy uses. Proteins are required for growth needs and for defending the body against disease. Certain vitamins are needed in the body cells. Without them, deficiency diseases can occur. Certain minerals are also needed in the diet.</p>
<p>Mental health is as important as bodily health. Stimulating activities should be part of everyone's everyday life. Depression can result in loss of a person's desire to accomplish realistic goals. When this happens, the body can also suffer because the person loses concern over good nutrition, proper exercise, and sufficient rest. Social workers and other behavioral scientists can help a person recognize and remove blocks in the way of sound mental health.</p>
