<p class="storyTitle">Beggars</p>
<p>In some American cities, you can't walk a block without being asked for money several times. Beggars fill the subways, street corners and parking lots of the biggest cities. Some are blind, while others have small children with them. Some offer to clean your car window and others say they're short of money to buy a bus ticket.</p>
<p>In the past, Americans thought nothing of giving a coin to beggars. But today, some people are so upset by the beggars that they have changed their route to work or refuse to ride the subway.</p>
<p>In 1988, the mayor of New York told New Yorkers not to give money to beggars. "Many people who ask for money just don't want to work for a living," the mayor said. He said many were alcoholics and drug addicts. He suggested those who wanted to help people in need should give to charities instead. Afterwards, some beggars said their income dropped by half on account of the mayor. Seattle passed an ordinance against aggressive beggars. Beggars who insist on getting money or bother people can be fined. The ordinance is rarely enforced because most beggars are flat broke and can't pay fines.</p>
<p>There are about 5&#160;000 beggars on the streets of New York. Many are mentally ill and have no jobs or money. At first glance, most look as though they could use some cash. But there are also phony beggars. In Los Angeles, a couple was cleaning up by telling people that the woman was pregnant and their money had been stolen from their car. For three years, they earned up to $180 an hour. Police said both were aspiring actors who lived in an apartment for free that would have cost $670 a month. Giving money to beggars doesn't help them in the long run. But many people say they feel better because they gave.</p>
