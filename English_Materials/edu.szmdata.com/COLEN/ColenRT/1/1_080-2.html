<p class="storyTitle">Birthday Present</p>
<p>The next day was his girlfriend's birthday and the young man was having a difficult time deciding on a present for her. She already had more clothes than she knew what to do with them, so he couldn't get any kind of apparel. She never ate sweets, so candy was out of the question. What then? He had a very special reason for wanting to impress her with just the right gift; tomorrow he was going to make an offer of marriage to her. He finally decided on perfume. All girls liked perfume. That raised another problem, however. What kind did she prefer? He couldn't ask her, because that would ruin the surprise. At last the young man hit upon a brilliant idea. That afternoon, pretending to take his girlfriend's fox terrier, Fritz, for a walk, he went to his girl's house and got the little dog. Together, the young man and the dog went directly to the perfume counter of the town's biggest department store. Good! There was a large array of perfume. He beckoned a clerk, instructing her to open a large number of bottles and wave the stoppers under the dog's nose. Nestled in the young man's arms, the terrier began to be restless and bored as this seemingly pointless game went on. Then Fritz suddenly became frisky, wiggling in the young man's arms and barking excitedly, as the clerk waved one stopper under his nose. "I'll take that one," said the young man to the clerk. The price was exorbitant; but it was worth it, he thought. "My favorite perfume!" said the delighted girl the next evening as she unwrapped the package. "How did you know?" she asked, adding some perfume behind each ear. "Intuition, I guess," said the young man, deciding that it wasn't exactly wrong to tell a lie under the circumstances. One day, after they were married, he would admit that his intuition had really been a little dog named Fritz.</p>
