<p class="storyTitle">The Garden Hotel</p>
<p>When you are next in Nanoko, be sure to stay at the Garden Hotel whether you come on business or on holiday, you will find everything as comfortable and as convenient as you would expect in a first-class international hotel. Every bedroom has its own private bathroom, telephone, wall-to-wall carpeting and colorful, modern materials and furniture in the local style. In the Mitsu Restaurant, you can choose your meals from as wide a variety of dishes, both Eastern and European, as you will find anywhere in the country. In the Beach Bar, you can drink with your family and friends in air-conditioned comfort, to the music of internationally known artists. Or you can take your drink outside into the beautiful garden that gives the hotel its name, or to the tables that surround the swimming pool. Throughout the hotel, you will find the service is both friendly and efficient. By day, the pool is alive with the holiday spirit and the happy shouting of children; and by night, soft lights and music make it the perfect place for a party, or simply for an after-dinner drink and conversation. The Garden Hotel has its own private mini-bus service. Give us a ring and we will arrange to pick you up at the airport or in the city center. Every day a bus leaves the hotel for day trips up into the hills to see the ruined city of Morote, or the villages and temples of the hill people; or along the coast to the seaside towns and wonderful beaches of Cape St Germain. If you prefer, we can arrange for you to visit the Wainiri Islands that lie just off the coast. Here you can swim and sun-bathe in private and in peace; or you can fish for one of the many varieties of sea-life for which the Wainiris are justly famous. The Garden Hotel is right on the beach, only five minutes for Nanoko's modern shopping centre. Here you will find all that Money can buy, at prices you can afford.</p>
