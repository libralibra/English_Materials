<p class="storyTitle">Where to Live</p>
<p>Many people who work in London prefer to live outside it, and to go to their offices, factories or schools every day by train, car or bus, even though this means they have to get up earlier in the morning and reach home later in the evening.</p>
<p>One advantage of living outside London is that houses are cheaper. Even a small flat in London without a garden costs quite a lot to rent. With the same money, one can get a little house in the country with a garden of one's own.</p>
<p>Then, in the country one can rest from the noise and hurry of the town. Even though one has to get up earlier and spend more time in trains or buses, one can sleep better at night and during weekends and on summer evenings, one can enjoy the fresh, clean air of the country. If one likes gardens, one can spend one's free time digging, planting, watering and doing the hundred and one other jobs which are needed in a garden. Then, when the flowers and vegetables come up, one has the reward of one who has shared the secrets of nature.</p>
<p>Some people, however, take no interest in country things. For them, happiness lies in the town, with its cinemas and theatres, beautiful shops and busy streets or dance-halls and restaurants. Such people would feel that their life was not worth living if they had to live it outside London. An occasional walk in one of the parks and a fortnight's visit to the sea every summer is all the country they want. They are quite prepared to leave the rest to those who are glad to get away from London every night.</p>
