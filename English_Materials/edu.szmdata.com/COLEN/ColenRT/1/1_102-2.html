<p class="storyTitle">TV</p>
<p>Television has now come to nearly every family. It has become a very important part in people's life. School children in the United States watch TV about twenty-five hours a week.</p>
<p>Soon people feel that television is good for children because it helps them learn about their country and the world. With the help of programmes of education, children do better in school.</p>
<p>Other people feel that there are too many programmes about love and crime on TV, and that even programmes of education don't help children a lot. Children simply watch too much television, so they don't do a lot of other important things for their education. Children of three to six learn to speak their language and talk with people. When they are watching TV, they are only listening to the language, and they aren't talking with anyone. When school children watch TV, they read less. Because of this, they don't learn to read or write quickly at school.</p>
<p>All children learn by doing, and they need time to play in order to learn about the world. When they watch TV, they play less. They also have less time to do with their parents and friends, and they have less time to have sports.</p>
<p>Recently, fifteen families in Denver decided to stop watching TV for a month or more. At first it was difficult, but there were soon a lot of good changes. The children read, played, and exercised more, and the family became full of joy. But at the end of the month all the families began to watch TV as much as before. Not one family was able to give up television completely.</p>
