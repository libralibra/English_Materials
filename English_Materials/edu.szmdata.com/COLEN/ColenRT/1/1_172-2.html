<p class="storyTitle">The Sea War Between Britain and Germany</p>
<p>The report came to the British on May 21, 1941. The German battleship <i>Bismarck</i>, the most powerful warship in the world, was moving out into the Atlantic Ocean. Her task: to destroy the ships carrying supplies from the United States to war-torn England.</p>
<p>The British had feared such a task. No warship they had could match the <i>Bismarck</i> in speed or in firepower. The <i>Bismarck</i> had eight 15-inch guns and 81 small guns. She could move at 30 nautical miles an hour. She was believed to be unsinkable.</p>
<p>However, the British had to sink her. They sent out a task force headed by their best battleship Hood to hunt down the <i>Bismarck</i>. On May 24, the Hood found the <i>Bismarck</i>.</p>
<p>It was a meeting that the German commander LÃ¼tjens did not want to see. His orders were to destroy the British ships that were carrying supplies, but to stay away from a fight with British warships.</p>
<p>The battle didn't last long. The <i>Bismarck</i>'s first torpedo hit the Hood, which went down taking all but three of her 1&#160;419 men with her.</p>
<p>But in the fight, the <i>Bismarck</i> was slightly damaged. Her commander decided to run for repairs to France, which had at that time been taken by the Germans. The British force followed her. However, because of the <i>Bismarck</i>'s speed and the heavy fog, they lost sight of her.</p>
<p>For two days, every British ship in the Atlantic tried to find the <i>Bismarck</i>, but with no success. Finally, she was sighted by a plane from Ireland. Trying to slow the <i>Bismarck</i> down so that their ships could catch up with her, the British fired at her from the air. The <i>Bismarck</i> was hit.</p>
<p>On the morning of May 27, the last battle was fought. Four British ships fired on the <i>Bismarck</i>, and she was finally sunk.</p>
