<p class="storyTitle">The Powerful Influence of Weather</p>
<p>Weather has a powerful effect on people. It influences health, intelligence, and feelings.</p>
<p>In August, it is very hot and wet in the southern part of the United States. Southerners have many heart attacks or other kinds of health problems during this month. In the Northeast and the Middle West, it is very hot at some times and very cold at other times. Many people in these states have heart attacks after the weather changes in February or March.</p>
<p>The weather can influence intelligence. For example, in a 1938 study by scientists, the IQ scores (measures of intelligence) of undergraduate college students were very high during a hurricane, but after the storm, their scores were 10 percent below average.</p>
<p>Weather also has a strong influence on people's feelings. Winter may be a bad time for the thin people; they usually feel cold during these months. They might feel depressed during cold weather. In hot summer weather, on the other hand, fat people may feel unhappy. At about 65 degrees Fahrenheit, people become stronger.</p>
<p>Low air pressure relaxes people. It increases forgetfulness; people leave more packages and umbrellas on buses and in stores on low-pressure days. There is a "perfect weather" for work and health. People feel best at a temperature of about 64 degrees Fahrenheit with 65 percent humidity.</p>
<p>Are you feeling sick, sad, tired, forgetful, or very intelligent today? The weather may be the cause.</p>
