<p class="storyTitle">The Living Statues in Barcelona</p>
<p>Las Ramblas is the most famous street in Barcelona. </p>
<p>Especially in summer, thousands of tourists go to the seaside by passing through this street, making it a centre of shops and bazaars. Not only can you find tourists there, but also thieves, swindlers, cops&#160;... among whom the living statue artists are the most special group. </p>
<p>These living statue artists were covered with grease paint in different colors, wearing season-disproportional clothes, standing on a pedestal for several hours without making even a single move. </p>
<p>Are they real or fake, the guests were wondering&#160;... and then suddenly the statues came to life, just for a few seconds to shift positions. But the movement of the statues seemed like someone just had breathed life into them. They really do look like statues, and that's how they got their name. </p>
<p>Usually there is a jar or a hat in front of them. They would change to another pose whenever some tourists put a coin in the hat. You may take photos after giving a Euro, or even less, but be careful not to touch the statues, unless you want yourself to be covered in paint. </p>
<p>It's a really special experience, don't you think?</p>
