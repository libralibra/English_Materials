<p class="storyTitle">Beijingers Speaking English</p>
<p>"Taxi drivers," said BOBICO (Beijing 2008 Olympic Games Bid Committee) staff, "are learning English to support the 2008 bid for the Olympic Games." Albert Selmer, a German businessman who speaks good English, was pleasantly surprised during his latest trip to Beijing. When he got into a taxi on Chang'an Avenue, the driver greeted him and asked where he would like to go in English! "This couldn't be imagined eight years ago when I first visited Beijing," said Selmer.</p>
<p>Selmer wouldn't have been so surprised had he known so many people are learning English in this Olympic bid city. Eight years ago Beijing failed in its bid for the 2000 Games. One of the reasons was that foreigners found it hard to communicate with Beijing residents, most of whom speak only Chinese. This time, the city is working to improve communication. "One great change has happened during Beijing's preparations," BOBICO officials are speaking directly in English instead of using interpreters as they did eight years ago. In addition to BOBICO officials, Beijing residents are looking forward to the 2008 Games by actively learning the foreign language. Free classes offered in a number of Beijing communities are enjoying high attendance. Residences are taught useful expressions, greetings, how to give directions and how to introduce themselves. Shop assistants, bus and taxi drivers and even policemen are learning English. The young taxi driver who surprised the German visitor is probably one of those learners. The first-stage aim of the "Beijing citizens' English speaking plan", started by the city government in August, is to popularize English among government staff, taxi drivers, hotel staff and shop assistants. In five years the percentage of Beijing residents who can speak English will be raised to around 30 percent from the present 15 percent.</p>
