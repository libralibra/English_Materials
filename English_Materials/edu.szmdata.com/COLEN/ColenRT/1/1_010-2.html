<p class="storyTitle">Women's Contribution</p>
<p>Men sometimes say, "We are better and cleverer than women. Women never invented things. We did." </p>
<p>It is true that men have invented a lot of useful things: machines, rockets, and guns, too. But scientists now agree that women invented one very important thing. It has changed history. They invented agriculture. </p>
<p>Before the invention of agriculture men were hunters. They went out every day. Sometimes they killed animals, and sometimes animals killed them. Life was difficult and dangerous. </p>
<p>Women had to go out every day, too. They collected roots, fruits and grass. Then, one day, more than 10&#160;000 years ago, a woman dropped some grass seeds. She dropped them near her home in the Middle East. They grew, and the first wheat was born. The idea grew, too. Women planted roots and fruit trees. Then they could stay at home and look after the children and the animals. </p>
<p>Women like baby animals. Scientists think that women kept the first domestic animals: dogs, cows, sheep and goats. Then their husbands did not have to go hunting for meat. They stayed at home. They built villages and cities. </p>
<p>Civilization began. </p>
<p>Men began civilization&#151;after women invented agriculture.</p>
