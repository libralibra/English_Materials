<p class="storyTitle">Feast on Turkey and Good Wishes at Thanksgiving</p>
<p>Four weeks ago US children dressed as monsters and asked for sweets. That was Halloween. In a few weeks American houses will be red and green and filled with presents for Christmas.</p>
<p>As if all this isn't enough, on Thursday this week, America will enjoy another festival&#151;Thanksgiving.</p>
<p>Children will have two days off school; shops will close and houses will be filled with families enjoying mountains of food. Every year, in Gainesville, Florida, all entire class celebrate Thanksgiving together. The class dresses up and puts on plays for their families. After the plays the families share a feast of traditional Thanksgiving foods like turkey and pumpkin pie.</p>
<p>Dean Foster, an 11-year-old boy, will take part in this celebration. He said: "I love Thanksgiving because it means time off school, lots of nice food and a happy family."</p>
<p>His brother Ben, nine, said: "The best thing about Thanksgiving is that when it is finished, it is time to start Christmas."</p>
<p>But behind the food and the large amount of money spent there is another message. On Thursday evening, Dean and Ben's family will make a basket and put it on the table as they eat their evening meal.</p>
<p>Each of them will write a list of things that they are thankful for and place the paper in the basket. The family will read the pieces of paper and take time to thank God and each other for providing them with comfortable and happy lives.</p>
<p>Thanksgiving is a traditional festival that started in 1621, when the first pilgrims arrived in the US to start a new life. After a hard year, they had a big autumn harvest. They held a feast and invited the native American Indians along to thank God for giving them enough food.</p>
<p>Many countries celebrate Thanksgiving. That is often fall after the fields have been harvested and the crops collected for winter.</p>
