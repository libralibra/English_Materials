<p class="storyTitle">A Wedding Dress</p>
<p>Emily's wedding dress arrived at five o'clock in the evening, just seventeen hours before the wedding. "I just try it on, mother!" she cried, as she ran upstairs. Three minutes later, Emily's cries brought her mother up. The dress was much too big for her. Emily was in tears. "Take it back to the dressmaker's," Mrs. Bale said. "She must alter it tonight. Hurry now. Take it off and go." The dressmaker's shop was closed. "CLOSED FOR ONE WEEK HOLIDAY" said a notice on the door. Fresh tears rose to Emily's eyes. She ran home again to her mother. "This is unlucky," Mrs. Bale said. "But what are we going to do? Shall I ask Mrs. Peter to help? She was a dressmaker once. I'm sure she could alter it for you." Mrs. Peter was brought in and began to work. She could see what was wrong. She had to take in a lot of material at the front, and that was a big job. In fact, she almost made it again. At about ten o'clock the work was finished, and Emily tried her dress on. It fitted her beautifully. The three women were having a cup of tea when the doorbell rang. Mrs. Bale answered it and looked into the worried eyes of a young woman. The woman was carrying a large box. "Does Miss Emily Bale live here?" she asked. "Yes, she is my daughter." "Oh, I am glad I've found you. There's been a mistake. Your daughter has my wedding dress, and I've got hers. And I'm getting married tomorrow!" She held out the box to Mrs. Bale.</p>
