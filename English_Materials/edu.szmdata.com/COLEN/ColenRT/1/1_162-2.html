<p class="storyTitle">Application Letter</p>
<p>It is exciting to apply for a job that really appeals to you. In making your application, there are a number of points for you to observe. In your letter of application, aim to say just enough to give a good account of yourself, without being tedious. If you are answering an advertisement, any information for which it asks must, of course, be given. This will usually cover your scholastic record and any further education and training. You may also be asked to give the names of one or two persons to supply references. For this purpose you should choose people who know you well enough to vouch for your character and ability; and in courtesy you should seek in advance their permission to be named as referees.</p>
<p>It will depend on circumstances how much you can usefully add about yourself. Your purpose is to bring to the notice of employer any good reason why you rather than any of the other applicants should be chosen for the job. If therefore you feel you have any special skill or aptitude for the work or, for example, any particular interest in the line of business, let this be known. Finally, there is your use of language. You cannot go wrong if you keep your sentences and paragraphs short, making sure the sense is clear and well expressed. Choose plain words so long as they convey your meaning.</p>
