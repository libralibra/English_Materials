<p class="storyTitle">A Free Haircut</p>
<p>A barber was in his shop, busily cutting a man's hair, when a handsome young stranger came in. He had a small boy with him. They sat down together and waited until the barber had finished. Then the young man told the barber to shave him and to cut the small boy's hair. The barber said, "Do you want me to cut the boy's hair first, or to shave you?" "Oh, shave me," said the young man. "Then I'll go down the road and have a glass of wine while you're cutting the boy's hair." The young man sat down in the barber's chair, and the barber began to shave him. When he had finished, the young man got up and said, "I'll go down the road now and have my wine while you're cutting the boy's hair." "All right, but don't take long," the barber warned him. The young man went out, the small boy obediently sat down in the barber's chair, and the barber began to cut his hair. As he had said, he soon finished, and then the boy sat down and waited. At the end of half an hour, when the young man had still not come back, the barber said to the boy, "It is a pity that your daddy's taking such a long time. Where is he likely to be now?" "I can't guess," answered the small boy, "and that man wasn't my daddy. I've never seen him before in my life. I was playing in the street this morning, and he came up to me and asked me whether I'd like to have my hair cut without having to pay anything. I said I would, because my hair was rather long, so he brought me here."</p>
