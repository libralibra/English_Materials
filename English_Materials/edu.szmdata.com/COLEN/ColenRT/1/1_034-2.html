<p class="storyTitle">The Danger of Air Traveling</p>
<p>Today, air travel is far safer than driving a car on a busy motorway. But there is a danger that grows every year.</p>
<p>Airliners get larger and larger. Some can carry over 300 passengers. And the air itself becomes more and more crowded. If one giant airliner crashed into another in midair, 600 lives could be lost. From the moment an airliner takes off to the moment it lands, every moment is watched on radar screens. Air traffic controllers tell the pilot exactly when to turn, when to climb and when to come down. The air traffic controllers around a busy airport like London Heathrow may handle 2&#160;500 planes a day. Not all of them actually land at the airport. Any plane that flies near the airport comes under the orders of the controllers there. Even a small mistake on their part could cause a disaster.</p>
<p>Recently such a disaster almost happened.</p>
<p>Two large jets were flying towards the airport. One was carrying 69 passengers and had come from Toronto. The other was carrying 176 passengers from Chicago. An air traffic controller noticed on his radar screen that the two planes were too close to each other. He ordered one to turn to the right and to climb. But he made a mistake. He ordered the wrong plane to do this. So, instead of turning away from the second plane, the first plane turned towards it. They avoided each other by the smallest part of a second. The distance between them was less than that of a large swimming pool.</p>
<p>This is an example of the danger that grows every year.</p>
