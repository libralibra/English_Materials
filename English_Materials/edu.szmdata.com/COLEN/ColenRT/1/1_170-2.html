<p class="storyTitle">Parents and Children</p>
<p>It is natural that young people are often uncomfortable when they are with their parents. They say that their parents don't understand them. They often think that their parents are out of touch with modern ways, that they are too serious and too strict with their children, and that they seldom give their children a free hand.</p>
<p>It is true that parents often find it difficult to win their children's trust and they tend to forget how they themselves felt when young.</p>
<p>For example, young people like to act on the spot without much thinking. It is one of their ways to show that they have grown up and they can face any difficult situation. Older people worry more easily. Most of them plan things in advance, at least in the back of their minds, and do not like their plans to be upset by something unexpected.</p>
<p>When you want your parents to let you do something you will have better success if you ask before you really start doing it.</p>
<p>Young people often make their parents angry with their choices in clothes, in entertainment and in music. But they do not mean to cause any trouble: it is just that they feel cut olT from the older people's world, into which they have not yet been accepted. That's why young people want to make a new culture of their own, and if their parents don't like their music or entertainment or clothes or their way of speech, this will make the young people extremely happy.</p>
<p>Sometimes you are so proud of yourself that you do not want your parents to say "yes" to what you do. All you want is to be left alone and do what you like. It is natural enough, after being a child for so many years, when you were completely under your parents' control.</p>
<p>If you prefer to control your life, you'd better win your parents over and try to get them to understand you. If your parents see that you have a high sense of responsibility, they will certainly give you the right to do what you want to.</p>
