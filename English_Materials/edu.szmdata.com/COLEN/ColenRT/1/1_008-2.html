<p class="storyTitle">Karaoke</p>
<p>More and more often we hear of people talking about Karaoke. What it is about still remains a question for many people. </p>
<p>Karaoke is a sort of acoustic equipment which was originally invented in Japan around the middle of the 1970's. It means "a band without people" in Japanese. In fact, it is just a music tape without words. </p>
<p>This equipment first appeared in some public houses and snack bars, and mainly for the customers to enjoy and relax. Most of the music in Karaoke was popular music. Therefore, at times, when anyone felt like it, he or she might sing songs to the accompaniment of the music that came from the equipment. </p>
<p>Shortly after its invention, Karaoke spread to the whole world. It was introduced to China where it was welcomed by many. </p>
<p>Although you are not a good singer, or even sometimes you may sing out of tune, you can always enjoy yourself by singing Karaoke.</p>
