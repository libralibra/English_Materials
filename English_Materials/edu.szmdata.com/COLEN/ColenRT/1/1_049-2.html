<p class="storyTitle">Barbie Dolls</p>
<p>In the mid 1940's, the young ambitious Ruth and Elliot Handler owned a company that made wooden picture frames. It was in 1945 that Ruth and Elliot Handler joined with their close friend Harold Mattson in forming a company that would be known for the most famous and successful doll ever created. This company would be named Mattel, MATT for Mattson, and El for Elliot. In the mid 1950's, while visiting Switzerland, Ruth Handler purchased a German Lilli doll. Lilli was a shapely, pretty fashion doll first made in 1955. She was originally fashioned after a famous cartoon character. Lilli is the doll that inspired Ruth Handler to design the Barbie doll. With the help of her technicians and engineers at Mattel, Barbie was born. This was a fashion doll unlike any of her time. She was long-limbed, shapely, beautiful, and only 11.5 inches tall. Ruth and Elliot named their new fashion doll after their own daughter, Barbie. In 1959, the Barbie doll made her way to the New York Toy Show and received a warm reception from the buyers. Barbie has experienced a lot of changes over the years and has managed to keep up with current trends in hairstyles, make-up and clothing. She is a reflection of the history of fashion since her introduction to the toy market. Barbie has universal appeal and collectors both young and old enjoy time spent with their dolls.</p>
