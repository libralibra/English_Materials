<p class="storyTitle">The Origins of Basketball</p>
<p>They tell us the origins of basketball can go back to Springfield, Massachusetts, where James Naismith invented a game for those who were always cutting men's gym class to play. The young men were unable to stay still and longed for a sport that was both exciting and interesting. After thinking over how to fill this blank, Naismith snatched some peach baskets, threw them as footballs and told them to go and play.</p>
<p>And so they did, nine to a side, wearing wool pants and turtlenecks. Basketball was officially born, in a form that is hardly recognizable today.</p>
<p>The game that celebrated its 100th anniversary has been quite popular. Those who have watched and played and coached basketball realize Springfield's importance in their sport's history. For it was the place where the game originated.</p>
<p>For Larry Bird, the game of basketball was born in a small town called French Lick, Indiana, where, walking to his grandmother's house from school every day, he passed a court full of older, stronger players. Most times he was too cold and hungry to play. Most times he played anyway, until the game became his great interest and his lifeblood.</p>
<p>Earvin Johnson had never heard of French Lick as a child. He was sure the game of basketball was invented in East Lansing, Michigan, where, after helping his father collect rubbish in the morning, he would seize an old plastic basketball and shake off the cold by shooting again and again. After a while, a warm feeling would come upon him, in spite of the snow.</p>
