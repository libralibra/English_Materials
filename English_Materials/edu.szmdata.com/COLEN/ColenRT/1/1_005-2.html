<p class="storyTitle">The Largest Library in the World</p>
<p>You might think the largest library in the world would be in Europe. But it isn't. It's in Washington D.C. It's called the Library of Congress. President John Adams started the library in 1800 for members of Congress. He wanted them to be able to read books about law. The first 740 books were bought in England. They were simply set up in the room where Congress met. Then Thomas Jefferson sold Congress many of his own books. He felt Congress should have books on all subjects, not just on law. This idea changed the library for good. The library grew and grew. Now it covers acres of land. It contains 20 million books as well as scores of pictures, movies, globes and machines. Experts in every field work here. Hundreds of people call every day with all kinds of questions. Many of them get answers right over the phone. The library is a large storehouse. Thomas Edison's first movie and Houdini's magic books reside there. And it is the proud owner of the world's best collection of comic books.</p>
