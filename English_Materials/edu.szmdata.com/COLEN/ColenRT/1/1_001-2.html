<p class="storyTitle">Expressions of Colors</p>
<p>Mary did not understand such sentences as "You are yellow." "She is blue today." "She has a green thumb." "She has told a white lie." and so on. So she went to her teacher for help.</p>
<p>Mary: Mrs. Smith, there is a color in each of these sentences. What do they mean?</p>
<p>Mrs. Smith: In everyday English, <em>yellow</em> sometimes means <em>afraid</em>. <em>Blue</em>&#151;<em>sad</em>. A person with a green thumb grows plants well. And a white lie is not a bad one.</p>
<p>Mary: Would you give an example for a white lie?</p>
<p>Mrs. Smith: Certainly. Now I give you some cakes. In fact you don't like them but you won't say so. Instead, you say, "No, thanks. I'm not hungry." That's a white lie.</p>
<p>Mary: Oh, I see. Thank you very much.</p>
