<p>Do you know what the word "jazz" means? Today it is used to talk about various styles of music. In the early 1900's, however, jazz was a kind of folk music played by African Americans. This early jazz was played by people in their daily lives simply for their own enjoyment. Indeed, whenever people got together, jazz could be heard.</p>
<p>Jazz was a mix of styles from Europe and Africa. From Europe, the jazz musicians borrowed ideas about melody and harmony, and the instruments they used. From Africa, they borrowed ideas about rhythm. Jazz rhythm was very strong&#151;it made people want to clap their hands or tap their feet. African rhythm had a different beat from most of other music. For example, instead of One-two-Three-four, the beat might be one-Two-three-Four. It was this rhythm that made jazz sound different. There was no other kind of music like it in the United States at that time.</p>
<p>Today, jazz has become a way for many people to express themselves musically. It is also a way for many people to make a lot of money by performing. The audience for jazz is international. Many of the world's biggest jazz festivals now take place in Europe and Asia. Fans pay a lot of money to see one of their favorite musicians at concerts or buy one of their recordings. It can certainly be said that jazz has influenced almost every other kind of music in the United States and Europe and produced some of the world's greatest musicians, composers and singers</p>
