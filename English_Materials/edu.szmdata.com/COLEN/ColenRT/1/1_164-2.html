<p class="storyTitle">Men and Women Shoppers</p>
<p>Shopping for clothes is not the same experience for a man as it is for a woman. A man goes shopping because he needs something. His purpose is settled and decided in advance. He knows what he wants, and his objective is to find it and buy it; the price is a secondary consideration. All men simply walk into a shop and ask the assistant for what they want. If the shop has it in stock, the salesman produces it, and the business of trying it on proceeds at once. All being well, the deal can be and often is completed in less than five minutes, with hardly any chat and to everyone's satisfaction.</p>
<p>For a man, slight problems may begin when the shop does not have what he wants, or does not have exactly what he wants. In that case, the salesman, as the name implies, tries to sell the customer something else. No good salesman brings out such a substitute bluntly; he does so with skill. "I know this jacket is not the style you want, sir, but would you like to try it for size. It happens to be the color you mentioned." Few men have patience with this treatment. And the usual response is: "This is the right color and may be the right size, but I should be wasting my time and yours by trying it on."</p>
<p>Now how does a woman go about buying clothes? She does so in a different way. Her shopping is not based on need. She has never fully made up her mind what she wants, and she is only "having a look round". She will try on any number of things. In her mind is the thought of finding something that everyone thinks suits her. Faced with a roomful of dresses, a woman may easily spend an hour looking around before selecting the dresses she wants to try on. Most dress shops provide chairs for the waiting husbands.</p>
