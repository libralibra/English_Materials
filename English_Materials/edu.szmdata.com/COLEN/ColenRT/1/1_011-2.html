<p class="storyTitle">TV Ads</p>
<p>Television in the United States is free. To pay for programmers, there are many advertisements. Often these advertisements are short plays with actors. The following television advertisement is like many others that Americans see daily. </p>
<p>We see a man and his wife at the breakfast table. They have been married for a long time. They are not speaking to each other. They haven't spoken to each other at the breakfast table for years. The husband is reading a newspaper. We can't see his face. The wife looks bored as she pours a cup of coffee for him. </p>
<p>Today she is using a new kind of coffee for the first time. Suddenly he puts down his newspaper. Something is different. Can it be the coffee? He takes another taste. It's wonderful. He smiles. </p>
<p>He looks at his wife and says, in amazement, "Doris, when did you cut your hair?" </p>
<p>Doris is pleased. She answers, "Two months ago." Doris asks, "Herbie, when did your hair begin to turn white?" </p>
<p>He replies, "A long time ago." </p>
<p>Doris says, "Oh, very handsome." </p>
<p>Now they aren't bored any more. Breakfast is different. </p>
<p>Has the new kind of coffee changed their lives?</p>
