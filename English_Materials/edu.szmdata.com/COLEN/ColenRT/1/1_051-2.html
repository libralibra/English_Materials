<p class="storyTitle">The Answer of Jason</p>
<p>Jason was born in a rich family. His father had a big company and he had two brothers. He was the strongest of the three but he didn't like to use his head. Of course he couldn't pass the examinations. Suddenly the war broke out. Young men were called on to join the army. His father thought for a long time and at last decided to send him to the military camp. Soon after that he was sent to France where they fought with Germans. The young man hated the life in the camp: They couldn't be supplied enough food and had to live in the cold and wet houses. Sometimes, they had to sleep on the hard ground and he was often afraid to be shot. He usually remembered the life in his country and tried to leave the camp. Once he made an excuse in order not to go to the front. Another soldier whose name was Bob reported the captain about it. Jason was punished for it. He hated Bob and the captain very much. In a fight he hurt the captain and he was sent to the court at once. "Have you hurt the captain, Jason?" asked a judge. "Yes, I have, sir," answered the young man, "But it was a fortuitous accident." "Oh?" the judge said surprisingly. "Why?" "The captain was standing just in front of Bob while I was shooting at the young soldier. So I hurt him by mistake."</p>
