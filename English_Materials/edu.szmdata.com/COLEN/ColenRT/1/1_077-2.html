<p class="storyTitle">Intelligence Didn't Work</p>
<p>Snoopy and Lou were robbers. Half a year ago, they decided to plan another bank robbery. It was to be their last one. Then they would give up this business and live a comfortable life. The job was so well done that the judge who sent them to prison for fifteen years each said it was the cleverest robbery of the century, and what a pity it was that their car had used up its petrol not far from the bank. After they were in prison for a few weeks, Snoopy and Lou decided to escape. Soon they worked out a plan as good as any they had ever made. Even the smallest points were considered carefully. They planned as a team because they lived in the same room, and because the guards, who had a great deal of respect for the famous robbers, left them very much alone. They decided the quickest and safest way to escape was to squeeze themselves along a drain from their present workplace in the prison to a quiet country road on the other side of the prison wall. The great day arrived, and the pair started along the drain. With great difficulty, they squeezed themselves along for what seemed ages. In half an hour, they could see daylight. When they got out, the two men were so pleased with themselves at their success that they slapped each other on the back. It was only then that they realized they were not alone. Turning round, they found themselves facing thirty astonished policemen, who were carrying musical instruments of various sorts. The next morning, the same judge seemed very sorry as he told Snoopy and Lou that the plan of the prison drain system, which they had studied so carefully, was more than twenty years old, and that the quiet country road was no longer there. The drain now led directly to the parade ground, where the police band had just finished practicing when the two robbers appeared before them.</p>
