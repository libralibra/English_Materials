<p class="storyTitle">What's Good to Eat and Drink</p>
<p>People in different parts of the world have very different ideas about what is good to eat. Even when people in different countries eat the same food, they often prepare it very differently. </p>
<p>If you were in Germany, you would find soup that is thick and heavy. If you were in China, you would find soup that is thin and clear. </p>
<p>On holidays most of us eat special foods. Year after year, even if many other things change, the food is always the same. Sometimes housewives begin weeks in advance to prepare the special foods that are traditionally served on certain holidays. </p>
<p>People in different parts of the world also have different ideas about what is good to drink. Among the most popular hot drinks are coffee and tea.</p>
<p>Coffee is very popular in northern Europe and in the Middle East. Some people put cream and sugar in their coffee. But in the United States, many people drink their coffee "black"&#151;that is without cream or sugar. </p>
<p>Tea is the national drink in China, Japan, and other Oriental countries. In the Orient, people drink tea without sugar. But in England, where it is also a national drink, many people use both sugar and hot or cold milk in their tea.</p>
