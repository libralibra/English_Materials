<p class="storyTitle">How to Shop Food Wisely</p>
<p>The average family spends about one-sixth of its income on food. Because food is expensive, it is important to spend money wisely when you shop. Here are some hints to help you shop better.</p>
<p>Buy only the food that you need. There are several ways to avoid buying extra food. First, make a shopping list before you go to the store. Then when you are at the store, follow your list carefully. Furthermore, do not go shopping if you are hungry. When you are hungry, foods look very delicious and you want to buy more than you need. Finally, go shopping alone if you can. If you shop with young children, they often ask you to buy unnecessary food like candy.</p>
<p>When you have a selection, choose the least expensive brand of a product. There are three points to remember when you buy a can of tomatoes, for example. First, look at the advertisements in the newspaper to see if your supermarket is having a special on canned tomatoes. In addition, when you are in the store you should check the price per pound of tomatoes. Sometimes you save money if you buy the larger size can; sometimes, however, you do not. Remember that a grade A product or a more expensive product is not necessarily more healthful than a grade B or less expensive product. Grade A tomatoes may look better, but all canned tomatoes have the same nutrients.</p>
<p>Shoppers seem to have special difficulties when they buy fresh fruits and vegetables. There are several things to consider when buying fresh foods. Because fresh foods spoil if not used, you have to buy the correct amount for the number of people you are serving. Remember that a pound of peas in their pod is only two to three servings, but a pound of string beans is enough for six servings. In addition, plan to use fresh foods that are in season because fresh foods are generally less expensive when they are in season. Finally, choose fruits and vegetables that have a bright, fresh color. A good color is often a sign that the food has a lot of vitamins. Careful shoppers try to get as many nutrients as they can for each dollar.</p>
