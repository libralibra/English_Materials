<p class="storyTitle">Getting into College</p>
<p>In many countries, such as France, Greece, and Japan, it is often more difficult for students to pass the college entrance exams than to do the course work when they are actually in college, and students who don't have much money are at a disadvantage. Students prepare for these tests for years in advance. Often, students attend a private school at night to get ready for them. These private schools are usually expensive. If their families don't have much money, students can't attend, and they might not pass the entrance exams without this extra preparation. </p>
<p>In contrast, students can easily get into an American or Canadian college at least more easily than in other countries. American students take an entrance exam called the SAT (the Scholastic Aptitude Test). However, colleges do not consider only SAT Scores. They also consider a student's grades and activities throughout high school. A student who has done well in high school will probably get into college. </p>
<p>What happens when a student finally enters a college or university? </p>
<p>Students in China, Korea, or Japan might find their college studies easier than high school work. On the other hand, when American or Canadian students begin college, many of them discover that they need to work very hard and study seriously for the first time in their lives especially if they plan to go to graduate school.</p>
