<p class="storyTitle">Soap and Water</p>
<p>"Wash every day&#151;and you'll die young, my son!" people often said those words, and that was long ago, of course.</p>
<p>Napoleon's wife had new clothes every month, instead of a bath. ("It's quicker," she always said.) Rich people did not often have a bath. They washed their hands and faces, but not their bodies. Many poor people did not wash at all. A young man once said to a doctor, "Soap and water have never touched my body." (And the doctor answered, "That's true, I know&#160;...&#160;")</p>
<p>Why didn't people wash in those days long ago?</p>
<p>Well, they did not have water in their houses. They carried water from rivers or from holes in the ground (i.e., wells). In towns, people bought it from a water-carrier. Sometimes it was expensive; and soap was always expensive. They drank water, of course; and so they were clean inside. They did not think about the outside! And this is true: they just did not like a bath.</p>
<p>Modern life is different. We use a lot of soap and water. And we are all quite clean. However, a few people use too much soap; and they often get ill. Who are these people?</p>
<p>Many young women work as hairdressers. They wash and then "dress" other women's hair. That is their job and they like it. Young hairdressers sometimes wash dirty heads on a busy day! Their hands are soapy for seven or eight hours every day; and that is not a good thing. A young hairdresser's hands are often red and ugly; and she must then go to a doctor.</p>
