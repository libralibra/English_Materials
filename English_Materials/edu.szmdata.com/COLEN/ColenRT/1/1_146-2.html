<p class="storyTitle">CATV</p>
<p>CATV is a short way saying "community antenna television". But "cable television" is the name most people use. Cable television allows viewers to receive TV programs that they can not pick up with their ordinary antenna.</p>
<p>Television signals do not follow the curve of the earth. They travel in straight lines in all directions. Signals from a TV station move towards the horizon and then go into space. If you live only a few miles from a TV station, you may get a good picture on your set. But if you live more than 50 miles from a station, you may not get any pictures at all.</p>
<p>CATV began in 1948. People in places far from TV stations had to pay for putting up high antennas. A community antenna was usually placed on a hill, a mountain or on a high tower. The antenna picked up TV signals and fed them into a small local station. From the station, thick wires called cable ran out to nearby homes. Each person using the cable paid a monthly charge.</p>
<p>CATV worked well, and soon new uses were found for it. Local stations could feed programs into empty channels 'that were not in use. People along the cable could have local news, weather report, and farm and school news at no extra charge.</p>
<p>Today, cable television has moved into cities. It brings in extra programs that city viewers with ordinary antenna can not see. It is also used in many classrooms throughout the country.</p>
