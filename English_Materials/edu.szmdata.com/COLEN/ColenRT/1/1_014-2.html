<p class="storyTitle">Honeymoon</p>
<p>Tradition says that at the beginning of the sixth century one of the tribes in Ireland was called Celt. The chief of Celt had a beautiful daughter, named Ellis, who was from childhood, fond of having honey. </p>
<p>When she grew up, lots of knights and princes from neighboring countries came to propose marriage to her. Ellis fell in love with a young master of a southern tribe who was among the proposers. They were soon in love with each other. At last they decided to get married. </p>
<p>On the wedding day, Ellis entertained the honored guests with honey wine made from the honey which had been presented by the young master. </p>
<p>After drinking the wine the guests sang high praise for it. They said the wine was as sweet as love. But there was too much wine for them to drink up. </p>
<p>The bride and bridegroom continued drinking it the next day. They were intoxicated with the sweet honey wine. It took the young couple a whole month to drink it up. </p>
<p>From then on, it was very popular among the local people to drink honey wine within the first month after the man and woman's marriage. They thought it stood for the sweetness and happiness of a newly-married couple. </p>
<p>Later on, it spread far and wide. People named the first month after marriage honeymoon.</p>
