<p class="storyTitle">Halloween</p>
<p>Halloween is an autumn holiday that Americans celebrate every year. It means "holy evening", and it comes every October 31, the evening before All saints' Day. However, it is not really a church holiday; it is a holiday for children mainly. Every autumn, when the vegetables are ready to eat, children pick large orange pumpkins. Then they cut faces in the pumpkins and put a candle burning inside. It looks as if there were a person looking out of the pumpkin! These lights are called jack-o-lanterns, which means "Jack of the lantern". The children also put on strange masks and frightening costumes every Halloween. Some children paint their faces to look like monsters. Then they carry boxes or bags from house to house. Every time they come to a new house, they say, "Treat or cheat! Money or eat!" The grown-ups put a treat&#151;Money or candy in their bags. Not only children, most grown-ups also love Halloween and Halloween parties. Because on this day, they can disguise themselves as the personages or ghost as their imaginations will lead them. This will bring them the satisfaction of being young.</p>
