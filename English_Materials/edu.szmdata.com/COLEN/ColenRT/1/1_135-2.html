<p class="storyTitle">See Well by Feeling</p>
<p>"If you want to see a thing well, reach out and touch it!"</p>
<p>That may seem a strange thing to say. But touching things can help you to see them better.</p>
<p>Your eyes can tell you that a glass ball is round. But by holding it in your hands, you can feel how smooth and cool the ball is. You can feel how heavy the glass is. When you feel all these about the ball, you really see it.</p>
<p>With your skin, you can feel better. For example, your fingers can tell the difference between two coins in your pocket. You can feel a little drop of water on the back of your hand, too. You can even feel sounds against your skin. Have you ever wanted to know why some people like very loud music? They probably like to feel the sounds of music.</p>
<p>All children soon learn what "Don't touch!" means. They hear it often. Yet most of us keep on touching things as we grow up. In shops, we touch things we might buy, such as food, clothes and so on. To see something well, we have to touch it.</p>
<p>The bottoms of our feet can feel things, too. You know this when you walk on warm sand, cool grass or a bad floor. All feel different under your feet.</p>
<p>There are ways of learning to see well by feeling.</p>
<p>One day I want you to close your eyes and try to feel everything that is touching your skin. Feel the shoes on your feet, the clothes on your body, the air on your skin. At first, it is not easy to feel these things. You are too used to them!</p>
<p>Most museums are just for looking. But today some museums have some things to touch. Their signs say, "Do touch!" There you can feel everything on show.</p>
<p>If you want to see better, you should reach out and touch and then you'll really see!</p>
