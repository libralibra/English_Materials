<p class="storyTitle">The Invention of Lightning Rod</p>
<p>The lightning rod was invented by Benjamin Franklin, who advised people to put a lightning rod on tops of their buildings. In this way, he told people, their houses would not be damaged by lightning.</p>
<p>What was lightning? Was it electricity? In Benjamin Franklin's time few people knew about electricity. But Ben wanted to know it. So he and his son made an interesting, but very dangerous experiment. They made a kite out of a large silk handkerchief. They fixed a wire to the frame. Ben thought the wire would attract the lightning.</p>
<p>One dark and stormy day they took their kite to a field. William held the ball of string and Ben held the kite. He threw it into the wind and shouted,"Go!"</p>
<p>It was raining hard as Ben took the kite string from his son. They walked to a nearby house. Ben put a key on the end of the kite string.</p>
<p>Lightning flashed about the kite. Thunder sounded. But nothing happened.</p>
<p>"I'm afraid it's not going to work, father," William said.</p>
<p>"Let's not give up yet," Ben answered.</p>
<p>Lightning flashed again. "Crack!" It struck the wire on the kite frame.</p>
<p>Suddenly the little threads on the kite string stood up straight. They were moved by an unseen force. Ben touched the key.</p>
<p>"Ouch!" he cried out, taking his hand away quickly. "I got a shock! But we've proved it! Lightning is electricity!" He was lucky that the lightning was weak. He was not really hurt.</p>
<p>Just on the basis of this experiment, the lightning rod was invented.</p>
