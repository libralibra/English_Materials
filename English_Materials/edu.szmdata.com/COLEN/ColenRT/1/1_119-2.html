<p class="storyTitle">A Self-introduction</p>
<p>I am a very sensitive person, and that's good to a point. I feel everyone should be able to feel or understand what others are going through. But when you feel hurt, cry or are unhappy for people you don't know, or for a movie that is not real, then I think that's a little too sensitive. That's the way I am.</p>
<p>I am a very independent person. I must do things for myself. I don't like people doing things for me, or helping me, or giving me things. It's not that I don't appreciate it, because I do. I just feel that when someone does something for you then you owe them, and if there is one thing I don't like to feel, it's that I owe anyone anything.</p>
<p>I think I would be a good friend, I would do almost anything for someone I like, to share or give anything I have. I'm very caring and understanding. People trust me with their secrets, and they're right for doing so because I never tell anything that is told to me. I'm always there to help in any way that I can. All you have to do is to ask.</p>
<p>I have a love for life and people that make me feel good. I find fun in almost everything I do (except housework). I love to watch people, talk to them, and be around them. It makes no difference whether I agree or disagree with what they feel or how they live or what they look like, or what age they are. I just love learning and being aware of everything and everyone around me.</p>
