<p class="storyTitle">The Quiet Country Cottage</p>
<p>Mr. and Mrs. Hooper have lived in Manchester all their lives. Mr. Hooper has worked in a bank there for a number of years. Now he is about to retire, and he and Mrs. Hooper are looking for a cottage in the country. A house agent takes them to a cottage on the edge of what he calls a "nice, quiet village". But Mr. Hooper remarks that the road through the village seems to be very busy. "Well, we're in the middle of the holiday season, of course," the house agent replies. "It isn't always as noisy as this." Just then, the noise of a train is heard. "What on earth is that noise?" Mr. Hooper demands. "It sounded like an express train." But the agent thinks it must be thunder. "The sky's getting very dark over there," he says. "I think we shall have rain before very long." The agent rings the door-bell. The house owner, Mrs. Wheeler, comes to the door, followed by her young daughter, Julie. Mrs. Wheeler invites the Hoopers into the sitting-room. Mrs. Hooper says what a pleasant little room it is. Mr. Hooper agrees with her that it is a little room. "And what are all those voices that I can hear?" He asks, the agent supposes that they must belong to the birds singing in the trees; there are so many trees and birds in that part of the country. But Julie knows better. "It's the primary school down the road," she says. "The children are playing in the playground. Sometimes they sound as if they're next door." The agent suggests that they go into the dining-room. "It's beautifully quiet here at the back of the house," he says. At this, a second train is heard. "I'm certain that was an express train," says Mr. Hooper. "I'm sure there's thunder in the air," says the agent. "It'll rain soon, you mark my words." But Julie puts him right again. "It was not the express train," she says, "it was the stopping train to Leeds. The express train would be along in five minutes." The agent shows the Hoopers into the garden. Mr. Hooper has no sooner said what a small garden it is, than an airplane is heard taking off. Mrs. Hooper is surprised by how low it is flying, and says she thinks it ought not to be allowed. The agent looks at the sky and wonders why it has not yet begun to rain. "It wasn't just flying low," says Julie. "It was taking off from the airport, just over there. You can see it from the bedrooms." "Would you like to see the bedrooms?" the agent asks, hopefully. "No, thank you," Mr. Hooper replies. "I think we'll get back to Manchester before it rains."</p>
