<p class="storyTitle">Travelers</p>
<p>Thirty years ago I worked in a company. My job was to sell the cars. I was young and strong and I had been to most parts of the world and I spent one fifth of my time in the trains or planes. I liked such a life and sometimes I called myself "traveler". </p>
<p>But one day I got into trouble. It was a cold morning. It blew heavily and the ground was covered with thick snow outside. I was still in bed though it was nine. I finished a long journey the day before and decided to have a good rest. </p>
<p>Suddenly the telephone rang and my manager told me to fly to New York to take part in an important meeting. I had to get up and after a quick breakfast I hurried to the airport. </p>
<p>The taxi went slowly and I missed the first flight. I had to take the next one. It meant I would wait for nearly five hours in the waiting-room. </p>
<p>But five hours later, a passenger said information showed there was a bomb in our plane and the policemen were looking for it. And another five hours passed and most passengers lost their patience before we were allowed to get on the plane. </p>
<p>At the entrance each passenger and their baggage had to be checked. A young man who seemed a soldier shouted at the policemen at the entrance, "If I had a gun in my baggage, I would shoot you two hours ago!"</p>
