<p class="storyTitle">My Childhood</p>
<p>I was born in New York, but I grew up in San Francisco. I began to live in London 25 years ago. If I were asked now where I want to live forever, I would say London. But I will always be American.</p>
<p>San Francisco, like London, has many parks. Every day my sisters and I were taken to play in the parks as children. I didn't go to school. I only had three hours of formal education when I was five. I was sent to school but came home at noon on the first day. I said I didn't enjoy it and hadn't learned anything. My parents decided that school was not right for me and I never went back.</p>
<p>My mother then taught my two sisters and me in the way as an English lady who had good education. We learned languages and reading more than sciences and math. Sometimes she taught us herself, but we also had other teachers. They asked us to take lessons every day. About once a week we walked to Golden Gate Park. While we were walking, my mother taught me to learn music. One day I noticed a little toy train in the window of a shop and I remember now how I'd like to have it. I couldn't say my "r" when I was small. My mother said if I could say an "r" well, I would have the toy train. I practiced and practiced. Then one morning I woke everybody up with my "r"s. I got the toy train. I usually get the things I want in life&#151;but I work hard for them.</p>
