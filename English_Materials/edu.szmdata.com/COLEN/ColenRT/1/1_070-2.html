<p class="storyTitle"><i>Guinness Book of World Records</i></p>
<p><i>Guinness Book of World Records</i> is a world famous collection of world records in human life, including all specific skills. How the book came out is an interesting story. On Nov. 10th, 1951, an Englishman, Sir Benjamin Lee, was having a discussion with his friends. They couldn't agree with each other whether the falcon flew quickest among all birds in Europe. And they failed to find the answer in any books. He knew that there must be many such problems in the world. Why not publish a useful book to provide the answers to all these problems? In 1954, Benjamin decided to work for it. He asked for help from two friends who owned an information supply centre in London, They put together the first edition of <i>Guinness Book of World Records</i> in August, 1955. The book had only 197 pages. But it was a great success. It was well received by readers and immediately won the No. 1 best-seller in Britain. The book of records has been renewed each year, and has been bought and enjoyed in 141 countries around the world. The 262 editions and 35 languages it has used may be a record itself.</p>
