<p class="storyTitle">An April Fool's Story</p>
<p>April 1st is a day on which, in some countries, people try to play tricks on others. If one succeeds in tricking somebody, one may laugh and say "April Fools!" and then the person who has been tricked usually laughs, too. </p>
<p>One April 1st, a bus was going along a country road when it slowed down and stopped. The driver anxiously turned switches and pressed buttons, but nothing happened. Then he turned to the passengers with a worried look on his face and said, "This poor bus is getting old. There's only one thing to do if we want to get home today. I shall count one, two, three, and on the word three, I want you all to lean forward suddenly with all your effort. That should get the bus started again. Now, all of you lean back as far as you can in your seats and get ready." </p>
<p>The passengers all pressed back against their seats and waited for his order. </p>
<p>The driver turned to his front and asked, "Are you ready?" </p>
<p>The passengers hardly had enough breath to answer, "Yes." </p>
<p>"One! Two! Three!" counted the driver. </p>
<p>The passengers all swung forward and the bus started up at once. </p>
<p>The passengers breathed more easily and began to smile. But their smiles turned to surprise and then burst into laughter when the driver merrily cried, "April Fools!"</p>
