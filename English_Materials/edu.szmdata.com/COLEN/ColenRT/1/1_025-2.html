<p class="storyTitle">I Can Drive at My Eighties</p>
<p>Mrs. Jones was over eighty, but she still drove her old car like a woman half her age. She loved driving very fast, and boasted of the fact that she had never, in her thirty-five years of driving, been punished for a driving offence. </p>
<p>Then one day she nearly lost her record. A police car followed her, and the policemen in it saw her pass a red light without stopping. </p>
<p>When Mrs. Jones came before the judge, he looked at her and said that she was too old to drive a car, and that the reason why she had not stopped at the red light was most probably that her eyes had become weak with old age, so that she had not seen it at all. </p>
<p>When the judge had finished what he was saying, Mrs. Jones opened her big handbag and took out her sewing. Without saying a word, she chose a needle with a very small eye, and threaded it at her first attempt. </p>
<p>After she quickly did this, she took the thread out of the needle again and gave both the needle and the thread to the judge, saying. "Now it is your turn. I think you drive a car, and that you have good eyesight." </p>
<p>The judge took the needle and tried to thread it. After trying many times, he still did not succeed. </p>
<p>The case against Mrs. Jones was dismissed, and her record was still not broken.</p>
