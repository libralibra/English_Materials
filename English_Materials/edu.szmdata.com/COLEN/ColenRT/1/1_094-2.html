<p class="storyTitle">Danger: Children at Work</p>
<p>Child labor&#151;the employment of children in industry, often against their will&#151;has been a problem for many years. Over a hundred years ago, Charles Dickens shocked many of his readers when he described the conditions under which young children worked in British factories. The conditions Dickens described continue to be almost unchanged today in many parts of the world. The only difference is that today employment of children is confined to small industries and family businesses, such as hotels, restaurants and particularly farms, rather than to large factories.</p>
<p>Girls suffer more from child labor practices than boys. Many of them are forced to start work when they are only ten years old. Although the work they are given to do is often light, it is often harmful to their health. Recently, children as young as six years were found to be working in Asian factories, and the children were working from eight to fourteen hours a day in overcrowded and unhealthy working conditions. Sometimes a whole family group is employed, with the payment going to a parent or older relative. The children not only receive nothing or very little for their long hours of work, but also they are prevented from attending school. Therefore, when they become older they are unable to do any other kind of work.</p>
<p>The solution to the problem of child labor is clearly better laws to protect young children, greater supervision of industry and heavier fines for those who break the laws. Only in this way can young boys and girls be allowed to enjoy the most valuable time of their lives&#151;childhood.</p>
