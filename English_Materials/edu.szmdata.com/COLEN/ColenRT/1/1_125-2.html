<p class="storyTitle">A Travel Experience</p>
<p>When Jim Brace was invited to attend an international conference on computer network, he was delighted. The conference was to take place in Geneva and Jim thought it would be a good opportunity to take Mary on a short holiday. They decided that they would go to Paris for a week before Jim traveled on to Geneva for a conference. Mary would then return home.</p>
<p>Jim and Mary spent an enjoyable week touring Paris. They did a lot of walking and at the end of the week, they were very tired. Jim went with Mary to the airport and saw her onto a plane for London. While he was waiting in the lounge for his plane to Geneva, a mist began to form. Eventually, his plane took off two hours later. As soon as he sank into his seat, Jim fell fast asleep.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, as the plane flew towards Geneva, the mist changed to thick fog. The pilot radioed his destination and was told that it was impossible to land there because of the fog. When this news was given to the passengers, Jim was still fast asleep. He did not wake up until the plane landed back in Paris. Still very sleepy, he hurried through the airport lounge and found a taxi. He asked the driver to take him into the Geneva International Hotel. The surprised driver looked at him as if he was mad. He asked him if he was sure that he wanted a taxi. Jim said he did, since he felt too tired to walk. At this the driver laughed and said that he did not imagine that Jim wanted to walk the two hundred and fifty miles to Geneva. On hearing this, Jim became fully awake and asked the driver where he was. He was told that he was in Paris, and that if he wanted to go to Geneva he had better take a plane. The driver said that the fog had started to clear. By this time the fog in Jim's mind had started to clear too.</p>
