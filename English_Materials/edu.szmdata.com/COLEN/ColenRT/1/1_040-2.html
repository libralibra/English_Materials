<p class="storyTitle">Prince and Princess</p>
<p>One morning, the prince waited under some trees and tried to decide what to do. He asked his friends to leave him alone for a while. It was not long before the princess knew that he was there. She soon appeared on a balcony of the palace dressed in white lace. Her black hair hung down from her head decorated with colorful bands, ribbons, and jewels. The prince and princess looked at each other and knew that their love was strong. They spoke. They decided that the prince should return later and ask the princess' parents if he could marry her. The prince decided to send a messenger to the Toltec king and queen. The messenger asked if his prince might be allowed to marry their daughter. The king and queen were very angry. "Never!" they said together. The two lovers escaped and went into the mountains to be married and to plan their future. The next day, the princess went to her family and the prince went to his. They told their parents what they had done. Each family was angry beyond words. They traveled through the mountains and valleys living on berries and fruits. They couldn't hunt because they had no weapons. As winter came, they became weak, but their love became stronger. They tried to be brave, to live on the strength of their love, but the winds were cold. They knew that they wouldn't be able to live long in the icy weather.</p>
