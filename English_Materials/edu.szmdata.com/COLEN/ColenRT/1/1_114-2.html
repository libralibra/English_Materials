<p class="storyTitle">Keeping up with the Joneses</p>
<p>In the United States many have been told that anyone can become rich and successful if he works hard and has some good luck.</p>
<p>Yet when one becomes rich, he wants people to know it. And even if he does not become very rich, he wants people to think that he is. That is what "Keeping up with the Joneses" is about. It is the story of someone who tries to look as rich and as successful as his neighbors.</p>
<p>The expression was first used in 1913 by a young American by the name of Arthur Momand. He told this story about himself: He began earning $125 a week at the age of 23. That was a lot of money in those days. Young Momand was very proud of his riches. He got married and moved with his wife to a very wealthy neighborhood outside New York City. But just moving there was not enough. When he saw that rich people rode horses, Momand went horseback riding every day. When he saw that rich people had servants, Momand and his wife also hired a servant and gave big parties for their new neighbors.</p>
<p>It was like a race, but one could never finish this race because one was always trying to keep up. Momand and his wife could not do that.</p>
<p>The race ended for them when they could no longer pay for their new way of life. They left their wealthy neighborhood and moved back to an apartment in New York City.</p>
<p>Momand looked around him and noticed that many people do things just to keep up with their neighbors. He saw the funny side of it and started to write a series of short stories. He called it "Keeping up with the Joneses", because "Jones" is a very common name in the United States. "Keeping up with the Joneses" came to mean keeping up with the people around you. Momand's series appeared in different newspapers across the country for over 28 years.</p>
<p>People never seem to get tired of keeping up with the Joneses. That is one reason why they read the "right" books, go to the "right" universities and eat in the "right" restaurants.</p>
<p>Every city has an area where people want to live because others will think better of them if they do. And there are "Joneses" in every city of the world. But one must get tired of trying to keep up with the Joneses, because no matter what one does, Mr. Jones always seems to be ahead.</p>
