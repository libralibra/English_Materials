<p class="storyTitle">Jack London</p>
<p>Jack London is a famous American writer. His most widely known book is <i>The Call of the Wild</i>, the story of the adventures of a large dog in the frozen north.</p>
<p>Jack London was born on January 12, 1876, in San Francisco, California. His family was very poor, and Jack had to leave school to make money. He worked in many different jobs. Later, Jack returned to school, but he didn't stay. He wrote, "Life and pocketbook were both too short."</p>
<p>In 1897, he wanted to go to Alaska to find gold. Instead, he found ideas there for his book stories. He returned home and started to write. His writings were successful, and became rich and famous in his twenties.</p>
<p>Jack London was not a happy man, however. In poor health, he took his own life in 1916. He was only 40 years old.</p>
