<p class="storyTitle">Me-Books</p>
<p>In America, where labor costs are so high, "do-it-yourself' is a way of life. Many people repair their own cars, build their own garages, even remodel their own houses. Soon they may also be writing their own books. In Hollywood there is a company that publishes children's books with the help of computers. Although other book companies also publish that way, this particular company is very unusual. It "personalizes" the books by having the computer make the reader the leading character in the story. Here is how they do it. Let us say your child is named Jenny. She lives on Oak Drive in St Louis, has a dog named Spot, a cat named Tabby, and three playmates whose names are Betsy, Sandy, and Jody. The computer uses this information to fill out a story that has already been prepared and illustrated. The story is then printed with standard equipment as a hardcover book. A child who receives such a book might say, "This book is about me," the company therefore calls itself the "Me-Books Publishing Company". Children like the Me-Books because they like to see in print their own names and the names of their friends and their pets. But more important, "personalization" has been found to be an important tool in developing enthusiasm for reading. Me-books are thus helping a child to learn how to read, by appealing to that natural desire to see his or her own name in print.</p>
