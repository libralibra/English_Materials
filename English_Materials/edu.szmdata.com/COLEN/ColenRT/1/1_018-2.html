<p class="storyTitle">Olympic Games</p>
<p>In 1896, the first modern Olympic Games was held in Athens, Greece. Since then many countries have successfully held the Olympics, such as England, France, Germany, Canada, the USA, Spain and Australia. </p>
<p>After more than a century the Games returns to its hometown this year. When people hold the Olympic Games, they always make an emblem. The emblem of the Athens Olympic Games this year is a white circle of olive branches in the sky. </p>
<p>Now Athens is developing a spirit of peace. An officer said, "While in Athens, the world should be at peace. We hope the peace is not just for a short time. We would like the message from the Athens Games to help countries come together and solve their problems." </p>
<p>In 2008, the Olympic Games was held in China. And China made a seal as the emblem of the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games. The emblem has a single Chinese character on a red seal and means "Chinese seal&#151;dancing Beijing". Below it, there are the words "Beijing 2008". The character in the emblem is "Jing". It means "capital" of China and it is also like a runner or a dancer. The running figure of the emblem shows the spirit of the Olympics&#151;faster, higher and stronger.</p>
