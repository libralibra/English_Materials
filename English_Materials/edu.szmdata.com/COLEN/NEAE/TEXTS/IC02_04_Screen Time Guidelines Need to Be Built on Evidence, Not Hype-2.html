		<!--p class="storyAuthor"><i>Open letter</i> from <i>The Guardian</i> (Fri 6 Jan 2017 16.23 GMT)</p-->

		<p class="z"><span class="lN">1</span> Moral panic about the impact of new technologies on our behavior and development is not new. Socrates railed against the dangers of writing for fear that it would nurture "forgetfulness in the learners' souls, because they will not use their memories." One source of contemporary anxiety is "screen time". Recently, a <a target="_blank" href="a%20letter.html">letter</a> signed by a group of writers, psychologists and charity heads raised concerns that childhood health and well-being in the UK is declining, in part due to "increasingly screen-based lifestyles". The signatories argued that the policy response to these concerns, first raised over a decade ago, has been half-hearted and ineffective.</p>

		<p class="z"><span class="lN">2</span> As a group of scientists from different countries and academic fields with research expertise and experience in screen time, child development and evidence-based policy, we are deeply concerned by the underlying message of this letter. In our opinion, we need quality research and evidence to support these claims and inform any policy discussion. While we agree that the well-being of children is a crucial issue and that the impact of screen-based lifestyles demands serious investigation, the message that many parents will hear is that screens are inherently harmful. This is simply not supported by solid research and evidence. Furthermore, the concept of "screen time" itself is simplistic and arguably meaningless, and the focus on the amount of screen use is unhelpful. There is little evidence looking at the impact of the <i>context</i> of screen use, and the <i>content</i> that children encounter when using digital technologies&#151;factors that may have a much greater impact than sheer quantity alone.</p>

		<p class="z"><span class="lN">3</span> If the government were to implement guidelines on screen-based technology at this point, as the authors of the letter suggest, this would be on the basis of little to no evidence. This risks the implementation of unnecessary, ineffective or even potentially harmful policies. For guidelines to have a meaningful impact, they need to be grounded in robust research evidence and acknowledge that children's health and well-being is a complex issue affected by many other factors, such as socioeconomic status, relational poverty, and family environment&#151;all of which are likely to be more relevant for children's health and well-being than screens. For example, there is no consistent evidence that more screen time leads to less outdoor play; if anything, the evidence indicates that screen time and physical outdoor activity are unrelated, and reductions in average time spent in outdoor play over time seem to be driven by other factors. Policy efforts to increase outdoor play that focus on screen time are therefore likely to be ineffective.</p>

		<p class="z"><span class="lN">4</span> Any simplistic approach to issues facing childhood health and well-being is inappropriate, and a focus on screen time is not evidence-based. Divisive and disturbing rhetoric that takes a casual approach to evidence is unhelpful at best and, in our opinion, damaging. Digital technologies are part of our children's lives, necessarily so in the 21st century. We agree that further research is necessary, and urge the government and research funding bodies to invest in this, so that clear policy and better guidelines for parents can be built on evidence, not hyperbole and opinion.</p>
