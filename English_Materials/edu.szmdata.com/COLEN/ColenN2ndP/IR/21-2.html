		<p class="storyAuthor">Marsh Cassady</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">1</span> CHARACTERS: FATHER; MOTHER; HEIDI, 14; DIANE, 17; SEAN, 16; RESTAURANT MANAGER, 20s; MRS. HIGGINS.</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">2</span> SETTING: Various locations including a fast-food restaurant, the Thompson family dining room, and an office at a high school.</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">3</span> AT RISE: As the lights come up, HEIDI enters and crosses Down Right to the edge of the stage. SEAN and DIANE enter and cross Down Left to the edge of the stage. They listen as HEIDI addresses the audience.</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">4</span> HEIDI: My dad's a nice man. Nobody could possibly believe that he isn't. Yet he's&#160;... well, he's always doing these stupid things that end up really embarrassing one or more of us kids. One time, see, my brother wanted to buy this guitar. Been saving money for it for a long time. Then he got a job at this fast-food place, OK? Waiting tables. It was Sean's first actual job, and he was real happy about it. He figured in two or three months he'd have enough money to buy exactly the kind of guitar he wanted. Mom and Dad were proud of him, and well, OK, he's my big brother, and he's always pulling these dumb things on me. But, well, I was proud of him too. You know what happened? I hate to tell you because:</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">5</span> SEAN, DIANE and HEIDI: (<i>In unison</i>) Father knows better!</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">6</span> (<i>The lights come Up Left on the fast-food restaurant where SEAN works. It consists of a counter and a couple of small tables. The MANAGER stands behind the counter. SEAN is busily cleaning the tables when FATHER walks in.</i>)</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">7</span> MANAGER: Good evening, sir. May I help you?</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">8</span> FATHER: Good evening.</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">9</span> SEAN: (<i>To himself</i>) Oh, no!</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">10</span> (<i>He squats behind one of the tables trying to hide from FATHER.</i>)</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">11</span> FATHER: I'm looking for the manager.</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">12</span> MANAGER: That would be me, sir.</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">13</span> FATHER: I'm Sam Thompson. My son works here.</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">14</span> MANAGER: Oh, you're Sean's father.</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">15</span> FATHER: Yes. It's his first job, you know. I just wanted to check that he's doing OK.</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">16</span> MANAGER: Oh, fine. No problem.</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">17</span> SEAN: (<i>Spreading his hands, palms up, speaking to himself</i>) What did I do to deserve this? Tell me what?</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">18</span> FATHER: Hiring him was a good thing then?</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">19</span> MANAGER: Well, yeah, I suppose so.</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">20</span> SEAN: (<i>Still to himself</i>) Go home, Dad. Go home. Go home.</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">21</span> FATHER: I'm sure he's a good worker but a typical teenager, if you know what I mean.</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">22</span> MANAGER: (<i>Losing interest</i>) I wouldn't know.</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">23</span> FATHER: He's a good boy. And I assure you that if there are any subjects that need to be addressed, Sean and I will have a man-to-man talk.</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">24</span> MANAGER: I don't think that will be necessary&#160;...&#160;</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">25</span> FATHER: Oh, no problem. I'm proud of my son. Very, very proud. And I just wanted you to know that I'll do anything I can to help him through life's dangerous sea.</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">26</span> SEAN: (<i>Standing up and screaming</i>) Aaaargh! Aaaargh! Aaaaaaargh!</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">27</span> FATHER: Son, I didn't know you were here.</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">28</span> SEAN: It's where I work, Dad.</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">29</span> FATHER: Of course. I mean, I didn't see you.</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">30</span> SEAN: I can't imagine why.</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">31</span> FATHER: Your manager and I were just having a nice chat. (<i>DIANE enters Down Left just as HEIDI enters Down Right. They look at SEAN and FATHER.</i>)</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">32</span> SEAN, DIANE, HEIDI: (<i>In unison</i>) Father, you know better than that.</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">33</span> (<i>The lights quickly fade to black and then come up a second or two later. SEAN stands alone at the Down Right edge of the stage. HEIDI and DIANE cross to Down Left edge of the stage.</i>)</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">34</span> SEAN: If that sort of thing happened only once in a while, it wouldn't be so bad. Overall, I wouldn't want to trade my dad for anyone else's. He loves us kids and Mom too. But I think that's sometimes the problem. He wants to do things for us, things he thinks are good. But he needs to give them more thought because:</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">35</span> SEAN, HEIDI and DIANE: (<i>In unison</i>) Father knows better!</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">36</span> (<i>The lights fade to black and come up on the Center Stage area where FATHER and the three children are seated around the dining room table. MOTHER enters carrying a dish, which she sets on the table. FATHER quickly rises and pulls out her chair. She sits. The family starts eating dinner.</i>)</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">37</span> FATHER: I have a surprise for you, Diane.</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">38</span> DIANE: (<i>Knows it can't be good</i>) You have&#160;... a surprise?</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">39</span> MOTHER: Well, whatever it is, dear, don't keep us in suspense.</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">40</span> FATHER: Well, you know, Dan Lucas and I work together?</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">41</span> DIANE: Kyle's father?</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">42</span> MOTHER: Don't interrupt, dear, your father is trying to tell you something.</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">43</span> HEIDI: (<i>Stage whisper to SEAN</i>) Something Diane won't want to know, I'll bet.</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">44</span> SEAN: (<i>Whispering to HEIDI</i>) Whatever would make you think that?</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">45</span> MOTHER: Sean, dear. Heidi, sweetheart, don't distract your father.</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">46</span> SEAN and HEIDI: (<i>Simultaneously</i>) Sorry, Mom.</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">47</span> FATHER: Now then. As I was saying, I know how much you like young Kyle.</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">48</span> DIANE: Father!</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">49</span> FATHER: It's true, isn't it? Didn't I hear you tell your mother that you wish Kyle would ask you to the senior prom?</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">50</span> SEAN: Uh-oh!</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">51</span> HEIDI: Oops!</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">52</span> MOTHER: Please, children, please. Your father is trying to speak.</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">53</span> DIANE: (<i>Through clenched teeth, the words are in a monotone and evenly spaced.</i>) Yes-I-said-that-why-are-you-asking?</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">54</span> FATHER: Well then.</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">55</span> DIANE: (<i>Becoming hysterical</i>) "Well then" what?!</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">56</span> FATHER: What did I say? Did I say something wrong?</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">57</span> HEIDI: (<i>To SEAN</i>) Not yet, he didn't.</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">58</span> SEAN: (<i>To HEIDI</i>) But you know it's coming.</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">59</span> MOTHER: Children, please. Do give your father the respect he deserves.</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">60</span> HEIDI and SEAN: (<i>Rolling their eyes</i>) Yes, Mother.</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">61</span> FATHER: Well, today I saw Dan and asked if he'd like to go to lunch at that French restaurant on Third Street. You know the one, Mother.</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">62</span> MOTHER: Well, yes, I believe I do.</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">63</span> FATHER: My treat, I told him. And, of course, he was glad to accept.</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">64</span> MOTHER: Why wouldn't he be?</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">65</span> FATHER: (<i>Somewhat surprised</i>) Well, yes.</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">66</span> DIANE: What-has-this-to-do-with me?!</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">67</span> MOTHER: Diane, sometimes I just don't understand your behavior. I try my best.</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">68</span> DIANE: (<i>Miry short with her</i>) I'm sorry.</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">69</span> MOTHER: Thank you, Diane. (<i>To FATHER</i>) Please do go on, dear.</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">70</span> FATHER: As I said&#151;</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">71</span> HEIDI: We know what you said, Daddy.</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">72</span> FATHER: Er&#160;... uh, what's that?</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">73</span> SEAN: She said, "We know what you said, Daddy."</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">74</span> FATHER: Yes, yes, of course.</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">75</span> MOTHER: Do get on with it, dear. I've made the most glorious dessert. An old recipe handed down to me by my great Aunt Hilda&#151;</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">76</span> DIANE: Mother, please!</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">77</span> MOTHER: Yes, dear?</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">78</span> (<i>DIANE shakes her head and lets her body fall against the back of the chair.</i>)</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">79</span> FATHER: At any rate, Dan's a nice guy. Never knew him well. Found we have a lot of the same interests. Our families, our community, global peace, human welfare.</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">80</span> HEIDI: (<i>Mumbling to herself</i>) That narrows it down, all right.</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">81</span> SEAN: Father?</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">82</span> FATHER: Yes, son?</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">83</span> SEAN: I do believe Diane would like to know the surprise.</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">84</span> DIANE: (<i>Breathing hard as if exhausted, she turns to SEAN, nodding her head up and down repeatedly.</i>) Thank you, Sean. I owe you one.</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">85</span> FATHER: Well, yes. Here it is then. I told Dan of your interest in his son.</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">86</span> DIANE: You what?</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">87</span> MOTHER: Diane, what has come over you? I just don't understand the younger generation. Why back in my day&#151;</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">88</span> DIANE: Mother, please!</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">89</span> MOTHER: What, what? What?</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">90</span> HEIDI: Mother, I believe she wants Father to continue.</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">91</span> SEAN: (<i>To himself</i>) Get this over with, more likely.</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">92</span> DIANE: Daddy, please, tell me. Now. Right away. What did you say, Daddy? Please. Tell me, what did you tell Mr. Lucas? Tell me, please. Please, tell me.</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">93</span> FATHER: Well, now, isn't this nice. It looks like my little scheme is a success. You're so eager to find out&#160;... makes a man feel as if it's all worthwhile.</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">94</span> HEIDI: (<i>To SEAN</i>) Can you believe this?</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">95</span> SEAN: (<i>To HEIDI</i>) Oh, sure. Can't you?</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">96</span> FATHER: Yes, well, I told him how much you liked young Kyle, and how you'd been wishing he'd ask you to the prom.</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">97</span> DIANE: You didn't! Tell me you didn't!</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">98</span> FATHER: Oh, yes. Anything for my children.</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">99</span> DIANE: (<i>Swallowing hard</i>) And&#160;... and&#151;</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">100</span> MOTHER: Diane, are you all right?</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">101</span> DIANE: (<i>She juts out her chin at MOTHER and quickly jerks her head around to face FATHER.</i>) Well&#160;... what did he say?!</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">102</span> FATHER: Well, of course, being the sort of man he is&#151;frank, understanding, he said he'd speak to the young man, insist he give you a call.</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">103</span> DIANE: (<i>Angry scream!</i>) Whaaaaaat!</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">104</span> SEAN and HEIDI: (<i>Together</i>) Father, you know better than that.</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">105</span> FATHER: I do? Yes, yes, I guess I do. I've&#160;... done it again, haven't I?</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">106</span> (<i>The lights quickly fade to black and then come up a second or two later. DIANE stands alone at the Down Right edge of the stage. HEIDI and SEAN enter Down Left and cross to the edge of the stage.</i>)</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">107</span> DIANE: Can you imagine how humiliated I was? An honor student, class president. And Father was out asking people to have their sons call and ask me to the prom! But that's dear old dad. Actually, he is a dear. He just doesn't stop to think. And it's not just one of us who've felt the heavy hand of interference. Oh, no, all three of us live in constant dread knowing that at any time disaster can strike because:</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">108</span> DIANE, HEIDI and SEAN: (<i>Shouting in unison</i>) Father knows better.</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">109</span> (<i>The lights fade to black and quickly come up again Stage Left where there is an executive-type desk and chair and two other chairs. Behind the desk sits MRS. HIGGINS, in charge of admitting new students to Benjamin Harrison High School. HEIDI and FATHER sit in the other chairs.</i>)</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">110</span> MRS. HIGGINS: So this is our new student, is it?</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">111</span> FATHER: That's right.</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">112</span> MRS. HIGGINS: What's your name, young lady?</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">113</span> HEIDI: Heidi Thompson.</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">114</span> MRS. HIGGINS: I' m sure you'll find the students friendly. And the teachers more than willing to answer questions.</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">115</span> FATHER: She is an exceptional young woman, you know.</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">116</span> HEIDI: Daddy!</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">117</span> FATHER: Very, very bright.</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">118</span> MRS. HIGGINS: Yes, now if we can get you to fill out&#151;</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">119</span> FATHER: Don't know where she got her brains. Her mother, I suppose. Oh, I was bright enough. But nothing like Heidi. All her teachers have told Mrs. Thompson&#151;that's her mother&#151;and me that she was just about the brightest&#151;</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">120</span> MRS. HIGGINS: (<i>Interrupts as she loses her patience, though trying to be pleasant</i>) As I said, if you have proof of vaccinations&#151;</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">121</span> FATHER: (<i>Interrupts, carrying on with his line of thought</i>) Besides being bright, she's very, very talented.</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">122</span> HEIDI: (<i>Twists her hands over and over in front of her chest</i>) Please, Daddy, don't do this.</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">123</span> FATHER: Well, of course I will, darling. I'm proud of you. Your mother and I are proud of you. (<i>Turns back to MRS. HIGGINS.</i>) Why just last year, in her last year of junior high school, before we moved, Heidi placed first in the county in the annual spelling bee! Isn't that wonderful? And she plays the piano like an angel. An absolute angel.</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">124</span> HEIDI: Daddy, please. Please, please. Daddy, I have to go to class. I want to go to class. Please let me go to class.</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">125</span> FATHER: See what I mean? Such an eager learner. I can't imagine anyone's being more eager for knowledge than my Heidi. My little girl.</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">126</span> MRS. HIGGINS: Yes, well, be that as it may&#151;</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">127</span> HEIDI: Aaargh! Aaaaargh! Aaaargh!</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">128</span> (DIANE and SEAN enter Down Right. They look at HEIDI, FATHER, and MRS. HIGGINS.)</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">129</span> HEIDI, DIANE and SEAN: (<i>Shouting in unison</i>) Daddy, you know better than that!</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">130</span> FATHER: Er, uh, I do?</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">131</span> (Curtain)</p>
