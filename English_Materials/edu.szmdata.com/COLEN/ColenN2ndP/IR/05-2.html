		<h4 class="storyTitle">Public Attitudes Toward Science<sup class="rl">R11</sup></h4>
		<p class="storyAuthor">Stephen Hawking</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">1</span> <a target="_self" href="../../POINTS/THESAURUS/unlikely_or_impossible_to_change.html">Whether we like it or not</a>, the world we live in has changed a great deal in the last hundred years, and it is likely to change even more in the next hundred. Some people would like to stop these changes and go back to what they see as a <a target="_self" href="../../POINTS/THESAURUS/ways_of_explaining_or_clarifying.html">purer and simpler</a> age. But as history shows, the past was not that wonderful. It was not so bad for a <a target="_self" href="../../POINTS/THESAURUS/in_a_good%2c_better_or_pleasant_situation.html">privileged</a> minority, though even they had to do without modern medicine, and childbirth was <a target="_self" href="../../POINTS/highly_plus_adj_structure.html">highly risky</a> for women. But for the <a target="_self" href="../../POINTS/vast_plus_noun_structure.html">vast majority</a> of the population, life was <a target="_self" href="../../POINTS/THESAURUS/words_used_to_describe_difficult_situations.html">nasty</a>, <a target="_self" href="../../POINTS/THESAURUS/words_used_to_describe_unintelligent_people.html">brutish</a>, and <a target="_self" href="../../POINTS/THESAURUS/talking_in_an_unfriendly_way.html">short</a>.</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">2</span> Anyway, even if one wanted to, one couldn't put the clock back to an earlier age. Knowledge and techniques can't just be forgotten. Nor can one <a target="_self" href="../../POINTS/THESAURUS/to_prevent_something_from_happening.html">prevent</a> further advances in the future. Even if all government money for research were <a target="_self" href="../../POINTS/THESAURUS/to_stop_something_from_continuing_or_developing.html">cut off</a> (and the present government is <a target="_self" href="../../POINTS/THESAURUS/to_try_hard_to_do_or_get_something.html">doing its best</a>), the force of competition would still <a target="_self" href="../../POINTS/THESAURUS/to_make_something_start_to_exist_or_happen.html">bring about</a> advances in technology. Moreover, one cannot stop <a target="_self" href="../../POINTS/THESAURUS/words_used_to_describe_intelligent_or_wise_people.html">inquiring</a> minds from thinking about basic science, whether or not they are paid for it. The only way to <a target="_self" href="../../POINTS/THESAURUS/to_prevent_something_from_happening.html">prevent</a> further developments would be a global state that <a target="_self" href="../../POINTS/THESAURUS/to_stop_something_from_continuing_or_developing.html">suppressed</a> anything new, and human <a target="_self" href="../../POINTS/THESAURUS/intelligence%2c_intuition_and_ability_to_understand.html">initiative</a> and inventiveness are such that even this wouldn't succeed. All it would do is slow down the rate of change.</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">3</span> If we <a target="_self" href="../../POINTS/THESAURUS/to_agree_with_someone_or_something.html">accept</a> that we cannot prevent science and technology from changing our world, we can at least try to <a target="_self" href="../../POINTS/THESAURUS/to_carry_out_a_plan.html">ensure</a> that the changes they make are in the right directions. In a democratic society, this means that the public needs to have a basic understanding of science, so that it can make <a target="_self" href="../../POINTS/THESAURUS/true%2c_definite_and_based_on_facts.html">informed</a> decisions and not leave them in the hands of experts. At the moment, the public is <a target="_self" href="../../POINTS/THESAURUS/uncertain_about_something.html">in two minds</a> about science. It has come to expect the <a target="_self" href="../../POINTS/THESAURUS/words_used_to_describe_slow_movement.html">steady</a> increase in the standard of living that new developments in science and technology have brought to continue, but it also <a target="_self" href="../../POINTS/THESAURUS/to_not_trust_or_believe_someone_or_something.html">distrusts</a> science because it doesn't understand it. This distrust is evident in the cartoon figure of the mad scientist working in his laboratory to produce a Frankenstein. It is also an important element behind support for the Green Parties. But the public also has a great interest in science, particularly astronomy, as is shown by the large audiences for television series such as <i>The Sky at Night</i> and for science <a target="_self" href="../../POINTS/THESAURUS/types_of_story_or_play.html">fiction</a>.</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">4</span> What can be done to <a target="_self" href="../../POINTS/THESAURUS/to_use_something%2c_or_to_be_used.html">harness</a> this interest and give the public the scientific background it needs to make informed decisions on subjects like acid rain, the greenhouse effect, nuclear weapons, and genetic engineering? Clearly, the basis must lie in what is taught in schools. But in schools science is often presented in a <a target="_self" href="../../POINTS/THESAURUS/not_insteresting_or_exciting.html">dry</a> and uninteresting manner. Children learn it by <a target="_self" href="../../POINTS/THESAURUS/relating_to_learning_and_the_process_of_learning.html">rote</a> to pass examinations, and they don't see its relevance to the world around them. Moreover, science is often taught in terms of equations. Although equations are a brief and accurate way of describing mathematical ideas, they frighten most people. When I wrote a popular book recently, I was <a target="_self" href="../../POINTS/THESAURUS/to_give_advice.html">advised</a> that each equation I included would <a target="_self" href="../../POINTS/THESAURUS/to_reduce_something.html">halve</a> the sales. I included one equation, Einstein's famous equation, <i>E=mc</i><sup style="font-size: 80%">2</sup>. Maybe I would have sold twice as many copies without it.</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">5</span> Scientists and engineers tend to express their ideas in the form of equations because they need to know the <a target="_self" href="../../POINTS/THESAURUS/exact_and_accurate.html">precise</a> values of quantities. But for the rest of us, a <a target="_self" href="../../POINTS/THESAURUS/words_used_to_describe_standards.html">qualitative</a> grasp of scientific concepts is sufficient, and this can be <a target="_self" href="../../POINTS/THESAURUS/to_announce_something_officially_or_formally.html">conveyed</a> by words and diagrams, without the use of equations.</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">6</span> The science people learn in school can provide the basic framework. But the <a target="_self" href="../../POINTS/THESAURUS/general_words_for_speed.html">rate</a> of scientific progress is now so rapid that there are always new developments that have occurred since one was at school or university. I never learned about molecular biology or transistors at school, but genetic engineering and computers are two of the developments most likely to change the way we live in the future. Popular books and magazine articles about science can help to <a target="_self" href="../../POINTS/THESAURUS/to_make_something_easier_to_understand.html">put across</a> new developments, but even the most successful popular book is read by only a small <a target="_self" href="../../POINTS/THESAURUS/a_share_of_something.html">proportion</a> of the population. Only television can reach a truly <a target="_self" href="../../POINTS/THESAURUS/words_used_to_describe_large_amounts_and_quantities.html">mass</a> audience. There are some very good science programmes on TV, but others present scientific wonders simply as magic, without explaining them or showing how they fit into the framework of scientific ideas. Producers of television science programmes should realize that they have a responsibility to educate the public, not just entertain it.</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">7</span> The world today is filled with dangers, hence the <a target="_self" href="../../POINTS/THESAURUS/extremely_unpleasant.html">sick</a> joke that the reason we have not been contacted by an alien civilization is that civilizations tend to destroy themselves when they reach our stage. But I have sufficient faith in the good sense of the public to believe that we might prove this wrong.</p>
