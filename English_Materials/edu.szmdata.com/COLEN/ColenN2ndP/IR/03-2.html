		<p class="storyAuthor">Foster Furcolo</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">1</span> He must have been completely <a target="_self" href="../../POINTS/THESAURUS/attentiveness_and_paying_attention.html">lost in something</a> he was reading because I had to tap on the windshield to get his attention.</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">2</span> "Is your cab <a target="_self" href="../../POINTS/THESAURUS/available_and_to_be%2c_or_to_become_available.html">available</a>?" I asked when he finally looked up at me. He nodded, then said <a target="_self" href="../../POINTS/THESAURUS/feeling_sorry.html">apologetically</a> as I settled into the back seat, "I'm sorry, but I was reading a letter." He sounded as if he had a cold <a target="_self" href="../../POINTS/THESAURUS/ways_of_describing_something_in_a_general_way.html">or something</a>.</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">3</span> "I'm <a target="_self" href="../../POINTS/THESAURUS/ways_of_telling_someone_not_to_hurry.html">in no hurry</a>," I told him. "Go ahead and finish your letter."</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">4</span> He shook his head. "I've read it several times already. I guess I <a target="_parent" href="http://english.stackexchange.com/questions/59200/virtually-is-like-almost-or-practically">almost</a> <a target="_self" href="../../POINTS/THESAURUS/words_used_to_describe_memory_and_memories.html">know it by heart</a>."</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">5</span> "Letters from home always mean a lot," I said. "At least they do with me because I'm <a target="_self" href="../../POINTS/THESAURUS/booking_on_and_travelling_by_transport.html">on the road</a> so much." Then, <a target="_self" href="../../POINTS/THESAURUS/to_calculate_or_count.html">estimating</a> that he was 60 or 70 years old, I guessed: "From a child or maybe a grandchild?"</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">6</span> "This isn't family," he replied. "Although," he went on, "<a target="_self" href="../../POINTS/THESAURUS/ways_of_talking_about_memories.html">come to think of it</a>, it might just as well have been family. Old Ed was my oldest friend. In fact, we used to call each other 'Old Friend'&#151;when we'd meet, that is. I'm <a target="_self" href="../../POINTS/THESAURUS/not_very_good.html">not much of a</a> hand at writing."</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">7</span> "I don't think any of us keep up our correspondence too well," I said. "I know I don't. But I <a target="_self" href="../../POINTS/THESAURUS/to_form_an_opinion%2c_or_to_have_an_idea.html">take it</a> he's someone you've known quite a while?"</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">8</span> "All my life, <a target="_self" href="../../POINTS/THESAURUS/almost_and_almost_not.html">practically</a>. We were kids together, so we go <a target="_self" href="../../POINTS/THESAURUS/a_long_time_ago.html">way back</a>."</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">9</span> "Went to school together?"</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">10</span> "All the way through high school. We were in the same class, in fact, through both grade and high school."</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">11</span> "There are not too many people who've had such a long friendship," I said.</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">12</span> "Actually," the driver went on, "I hadn't seen him more than <a target="_self" href="../../POINTS/THESAURUS/rarely_and_not_often.html">once or twice</a> a year over the past 25 or 30 years because I moved away from the old neighborhood and you <a target="_self" href="../../POINTS/THESAURUS/ways_of_describing_something_in_a_general_way.html">kind of</a> lose touch even though you never forget. He was a great guy."</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">13</span> "You said 'was'. Does that mean&#151;?"</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">14</span> He nodded. "Died a couple of weeks ago."</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">15</span> "I'm sorry," I said. "It'<a target="_self" href="../../POINTS/THESAURUS/not_pleasant_and_enjoyable.html">s no fun</a> to lose any friend&#151;and losing a real old one is even <a target="_self" href="../../POINTS/THESAURUS/difficult_to_do_and_involving_a_lot_of_effort.html">tougher</a>."</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">16</span> He didn't reply to that, and we rode on in silence for a few minutes. But I realized that Old Ed was still <a target="_self" href="../../POINTS/THESAURUS/making_you_feel_worried.html">on his mind</a> when he spoke again, <a target="_parent" href="http://english.stackexchange.com/questions/59200/virtually-is-like-almost-or-practically">almost</a> more to himself than to me: "I should have kept in touch. Yes," he repeated, "I should have kept in touch."</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">17</span> "Well," I agreed, "we should all keep in touch with old friends more than we do. But things <a target="_self" href="../../POINTS/THESAURUS/general_words_meaning_to_happen.html">come up</a> and we just don't seem to find the time."</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">18</span> He <a target="_self" href="../../POINTS/THESAURUS/to_use_a_particular_gesture_to_communicate_something.html">shrugged</a>. "We used to find the time," he said. "That's even mentioned in the letter." He handed it over to me. "Take a look."</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">19</span> "Thanks," I said, "but I don't want to read your mail. That's <a target="_self" href="../../POINTS/THESAURUS/slightly%2c_to_some_degree_and_not_completely.html">pretty</a> personal."</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">20</span> The driver <a target="_self" href="../../POINTS/THESAURUS/to_use_a_particular_gesture_to_communicate_something.html">shrugged</a>. "Old Ed's dead. There's nothing personal now. Go ahead," he <a target="_self" href="../../POINTS/THESAURUS/to_give_advice.html">urged</a> me.</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">21</span> The letter was written in pencil. It began with the greeting "Old Friend," and the first sentence <a target="_self" href="../../POINTS/THESAURUS/to_cause_someone_to_remember.html">reminded</a> me of myself. <i>I've been meaning to write for some time, but I've always postponed it.</i> It then went on to say that he often thought about the good times they had had together when they both lived in the same neighborhood. It had references to things that probably meant something to the driver, such as <i>the time Tim Shea broke the window, the Halloween that we tied Old Mr. Parker's gate, and when Mrs. Culver used to keep us after school.</i></p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">22</span> "You must have spent a lot of time together," I said to him.</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">23</span> "Like it says there," he answered, "about all we had to spend in those days was time." He shook his head: "Time."</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">24</span> I thought the next paragraph of the letter was a little sad: <i>I began the letter with "Old Friend" because that's what we've become over the years&#151;old friends. And there aren't many of us left.</i></p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">25</span> "You know," I said to him, "when it says here that there aren't many of us left, that's <a target="_self" href="../../POINTS/THESAURUS/completely_and_thoroughly.html">absolutely</a> right. Every time I go to a class <a target="_self" href="../../POINTS/THESAURUS/informal_meetings.html">reunion</a>, for example, there are fewer and fewer still around."</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">26</span> "Time goes by," the driver said.</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">27</span> "Did you two work at the same place?" I asked him.</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">28</span> "No, but we <a target="_self" href="../../POINTS/THESAURUS/to_spend_time_with_friends.html">hung out</a> on the same corner when we were single. And then, when we were married, we used to go to each other's house <a target="_self" href="../../POINTS/THESAURUS/sometimes%2c_but_not_often.html">every now and then</a>. But for the last 20 or 30 years it's been mostly just Christmas cards. Of course there'd be always a note we'd each add to the cards&#151;usually some news about our families, you know, what the kids were doing, who moved where, a new grandchild, things like that&#151;but never a real letter or <a target="_self" href="../../POINTS/THESAURUS/similar_and_similarly.html">anything like</a> that."</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">29</span> "This is a good part here," I said. "Where it says <i>Your friendship over the years has meant an <a target="_self" href="../../POINTS/THESAURUS/complete_and_thorough.html">awful</a> lot to me, more than I can say because I'm not good at saying things like that.</i>" I found myself nodding in agreement. "That must have made you feel good, didn't it?"</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">30</span> The driver said something that I couldn't understand because he seemed to be all <a target="_self" href="../../POINTS/THESAURUS/feeling_sad_or_unhappy.html">choked up</a>, so I continued: "I know I'd like to receive a letter like that from my oldest friend."</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">31</span> We were getting close to our destination so I <a target="_self" href="../../POINTS/THESAURUS/to_avoid_doing_something%2c_or_to_avoid_something.html">skipped</a> to the last paragraph. <i>So I thought you'd like to know that I was thinking of you.</i> And it was signed, <i>Your Old Friend, Tom.</i></p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">32</span> I handed back the letter as we stopped at my hotel. "Enjoyed talking with you," I said as I took my suitcase out of the cab. Tom? The letter was signed <i>Tom?</i></p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">33</span> "I thought your friend's name was Ed," I said. "Why did he sign it <i>Tom</i>?"</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">34</span> "The letter was not from Ed to me," he explained. "I'm Tom. It's a letter I wrote to him before I knew he'd died. So I never mailed it."</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">35</span> He looked <a target="_self" href="../../POINTS/THESAURUS/slightly%2c_to_some_degree_and_not_completely.html">sort of</a> sorrowful, or as if he were trying to see something in the distance. "I guess I should have written it sooner."</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">36</span> When I got to my hotel room I didn't <a target="_self" href="../../POINTS/THESAURUS/to_empty_a_place_or_container%2c_or_to_become_empty.html">unpack</a> <a target="_self" href="../../POINTS/THESAURUS/happening_or_done_quickly%2c_suddenly_or_immediately.html">right away</a>. First I had to write a letter&#151;and mail it.</p>
