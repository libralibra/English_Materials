		<p class="storyAuthor">Max Alexander</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">1</span> The hot sun burned his skin as Alfredo Qui&ntilde;ones-Hinojosa bent in the field to pick tomatoes. It was work few Americans would do for just $155 a week, and most of his co-workers on this 10,000-acre farm in central California were, like Qui&ntilde;ones, illegal Mexican immigrants.</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">2</span> It had been a year since Qui&ntilde;ones jumped the fence in the border city of Calexico, California, with the help of his cousin on January 2, 1987, Qui&ntilde;ones's 19th birthday.</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">3</span> The oldest of five children, Alfredo began work at age five, pumping gas at his father's filling station. When he grew older, he helped bring in extra money by working at a taco stand.</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">4</span> Still, he kept up with school. "My father kept telling me, 'You want to be like me? Just never go to school.' And I was not going to follow the same path." At age 14, Qui&ntilde;ones qualified for an accelerated program in Mexicali that prepared students for jobs as elementary school teachers.</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">5</span> He graduated near the top of his class. But because his family had no political connections, he was assigned a teaching job at a remote school. "I wasn't willing to put up with that injustice," he says.</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">6</span> Shortly after, he decided to leave Mexico in search of better options. He had been to America twice before, doing summer labor. So on his arrival, Qui&ntilde;ones headed with his cousin for the San Joaquin Valley to work in the fields. "I picked tomatoes, cauliflower, broccoli, corn, grapes."</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">7</span> When Qui&ntilde;ones looked up from the dirt, the best job he could see was driving the big tractors. The drivers were skilled, and they supervised crews. He was told it took ten years of fieldwork to land such a promotion, but Qui&ntilde;ones was soon behind the wheel of sophisticated plows and ditchdiggers. He learned how to service the engines and qualified for a temporary work permit.</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">8</span> A few months later, Qui&ntilde;ones told his cousin he was going to leave the farm. His response was, "What are you talking about? If you keep working here, one day you'll be the foreman!"</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">9</span> "Sometimes you have to be willing to risk," Qui&ntilde;ones said.</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">10</span> He moved to Stockton and took a job in a rail yard so he could attend night school at San Joaquin Delta College, learning English. His first job, shoveling sulfur, was the worst of his life&#151;smelly and filthy. Once again, he scrambled to acquire new skills, this time as a welder repairing valves on tank cars. Within a year, he'd become a foreman.</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">11</span> With his English improving, Qui&ntilde;ones switched to the night shift and began full-time studies in science and math. To make ends meet, he also tutored other students.</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">12</span> After graduating with an associate's degree in 1991, Qui&ntilde;ones was accepted to the University of California, Berkeley. He moved to a low-rent district in Oakland, getting by on a combination of scholarships, loans, a small grant and, as always, work.</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">13</span> Qui&ntilde;ones excelled in the competitive environment of Berkeley, getting straight A's in advanced classes, writing his honors thesis on the role of drug receptors in the brain and teaching calculus on the side. In the spring of 1993, his mentor looked over his transcripts and told him he stood a good chance of getting into Harvard Medical School. Qui&ntilde;ones decided to give it a try.</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">14</span> Harvard accepted him, and Qui&ntilde;ones moved East in the fall of 1994. Three years later, Qui&ntilde;ones became a U.S. citizen. "I'm sitting there, ten years after hopping the fence, and it hits me how fast I came up."</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">15</span> Qui&ntilde;ones gave the commencement address when he graduated from Harvard Medical School and continued his training, in neurosurgery, at the University of California, San Francisco. It was an exciting but daunting prospect. Could an illegal Mexican fieldworker become a brain surgeon? It didn't seem possible.</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">16</span> Residency turned out to be a low point in Qui&ntilde;ones' American journey. "Neurosurgery has been reserved for people who come from a long pedigree of medicine," he says carefully. "It's rare that you have someone like me go into this highly demanding field, where lots of patients die." He'd experienced prejudice before&#151;the farm owner's son who looked right through him, a former girlfriend whose mother disdained him for his nationality. "They just ignited my fire even more," he says.</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">17</span> He admits there were times, working 130 hours a week for $30,000 a year, when he considered quitting. "I felt what my father felt, not being able to put food on the table for my family," he says. "But I had a dream."</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">18</span> Dr. Qui&ntilde;ones, the noted brain surgeon, now 40, sits on the edge of a patient's bed. It's a Friday morning at Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center in Baltimore, and this will be his second brain surgery patient of the day. The woman, who's in her 60s, has two tumors; one is in the highly sensitive part of the cortex that controls motor movements. Qui&ntilde;ones holds her hand and looks into her eyes. "I walk a fine line every day between good and bad outcomes, and bad outcomes can mean life or death." he tells her frankly. She nods. Dr. Q, as everyone calls him, believes patients deserve both compassion and honesty. "That is the risk," he concludes. "So we're set. You and I have a date."</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">19</span> The four-and-a-half-hour procedure goes well&#151;the patient comes to with no loss of motor function&#151;and Dr. Q is ecstatic.</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">20</span> Although Dr. Qui&ntilde;ones is a relatively young doctor, his colleagues are already impressed. "Not only is he a talented and conscientious surgeon, but he's very sensitive to the needs of patients," says Dr. Henry Brem, director of neurosurgery at Johns Hopkins. "And he's a joyous person&#151;full of enthusiasm and the mission to do good for the world."</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">21</span> It's now after seven, and Dr. Q has been working for 12 hours. Other surgeons are going home for the weekend, but he is headed for his research laboratory in downtown Baltimore. The lab is an extension of his operating room: Cancerous tissue that he removes in surgery is studied with the goal of finding new therapies. "One hope is that we can make brain cancer a bit more chronic, like diabetes, instead of a devastating lethal disease," he explains.</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">22</span> The following afternoon, many of the med students show up at Dr. Q's home for a Tex-Mex cookout. While flipping tortillas on the grill on the back porch, Dr. Q says, "I think my background allows me to interact with my patients in a more humanistic way. When they're scared, I'm one of them. I'm just lucky that patients allow me to touch their brains, their lives. When I go in, I see these incredible blood vessels. And it always brings me back to the time I used to pick those huge, beautiful tomatoes with my own hands. Now I am here, looking at the same color&#151;that bright red that just fills the brain with nutrition and wonder. I'm right there in the field, and I'm just doing it."</p>
