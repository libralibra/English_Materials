		<h4 class="storyTitle">Tony Trivisonno's American Dream<sup class="rl">R4</sup></h4>
		<p class="storyAuthor">Frederick C. Crawford</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">1</span> He came from a <a target="_self" href="../../POINTS/THESAURUS/covered_with_a_specific_substance.html">rocky</a> farm in Italy, somewhere south of Rome. How or when he got to America, I don't know. But one evening I found him standing in the driveway, behind my garage. He was about five-foot-seven or eight, and <a target="_self" href="../../POINTS/THESAURUS/thin_in_an_unattractive_or_unhealthy_way.html">thin</a>.</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">2</span> "I <a target="_self" href="../../POINTS/THESAURUS/gardening.html">mow</a> your lawn," he said. It was hard to <a target="_self" href="../../POINTS/THESAURUS/to_understand_something.html">comprehend</a> his <a target="_self" href="../../POINTS/THESAURUS/varieties_and_types_of_english.html">broken English</a>.</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">3</span> I asked him his name. "Tony Trivisonno," he replied. "I mow your lawn." I told Tony that I couldn't <a target="_self" href="../../POINTS/THESAURUS/to_provide_something_needed_or_missing.html">afford</a> a gardener.</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">4</span> "I mow your lawn," he said again, then walked away. I went into my house unhappy. Yes, these Depression days were difficult, but how could I <a target="_self" href="../../POINTS/THESAURUS/to_refuse_permission%2c_or_to_not_allow_something.html">turn away</a> a person who had come to me for help?</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">5</span> When I got home from work the next evening, the lawn had been mowed, the garden weeded, and the walks swept. I asked my wife what had happened.</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">6</span> "A man got the lawn mower out of the garage and worked on the yard," she answered. "I <a target="_self" href="../../POINTS/THESAURUS/to_believe_or_accept_that_something_is_true_or_exists.html">assumed</a> you had <a target="_self" href="../../POINTS/THESAURUS/to_employ_someone.html">hired</a> him."</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">7</span> I told her of my experience the night before. We thought it strange that he had not asked for pay.</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">8</span> The next two days were busy, and I forgot about Tony. We were trying to rebuild our business and bring some of our workers back to the plants. But on Friday, returning home a little early, I saw Tony again, behind the garage. I <a target="_self" href="../../POINTS/THESAURUS/praise_and_admiration.html">complimented</a> him on the work he had done.</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">9</span> "I mow your lawn," he said.</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">10</span> I <a target="_self" href="../../POINTS/THESAURUS/to_succeed_in_doing_something.html">managed</a> to work out some kind of small weekly pay, and each day Tony cleaned up the yard and took care of any little tasks. My wife said he was very helpful whenever there were any heavy objects to lift or things to fix.</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">11</span> Summer passed into fall, and winds blew cold. "Mr. Craw, snow pretty soon," Tony told me one evening. "When winter come, you give me job <a target="_self" href="../../POINTS/THESAURUS/to_remove_something.html">clearing</a> snow at the factory."</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">12</span> Well, what do you do with such <a target="_self" href="../../POINTS/THESAURUS/determination_and_ambition.html">determination</a> and hope? Of course, Tony got his job at the factory.</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">13</span> The months passed. I asked the personnel department for a report. They said Tony was a very good worker.</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">14</span> One day I found Tony at our meeting place behind the garage. "I want to be 'prentice," he said.</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">15</span> We had a pretty good apprentice school that trained laborers. But I doubted whether Tony had the <a target="_self" href="../../POINTS/THESAURUS/skill%2c_talent_and_ability.html">capacity</a> to read blueprints and micrometers or do <a target="_self" href="../../POINTS/THESAURUS/the_quality_of_being_exact_and_accurate.html">precision</a> work. Still, how could I turn him down?</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">16</span> Tony took a cut in pay to become an apprentice. Months later, I got a report that he had graduated as a skilled grinder. He had learned to read the millionths of an inch on the micrometer and to shape the grinding wheel with an instrument set with a diamond. My wife and I were delighted with what we felt was a satisfying end of the story.</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">17</span> A year or two passed, and again I found Tony in his usual waiting place. We talked about his work, and I asked him what he wanted.</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">18</span> "Mr. Craw," he said, "I like a buy a house." On the edge of town, he had found a house for sale, a complete <a target="_self" href="../../POINTS/THESAURUS/shipwrecks_and_accidents_at_sea.html">wreck</a>.</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">19</span> I called on a banker friend. "Do you ever <a target="_self" href="../../POINTS/THESAURUS/to_lend_something_to_someone.html">loan</a> money on character?" I asked. "No," he said. "We can't afford to. No sale."</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">20</span> "Now, wait a minute," I replied. "Here is a hard-working man, a man of character, I can promise you that. He's got a good job. You're not getting a damn thing from your lot. It will stay there for years. At least he will pay your interest."</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">21</span> <a target="_self" href="../../POINTS/THESAURUS/not_willing_to_do_something.html">Reluctantly</a>, the banker wrote a mortgage for $2,000 and gave Tony the house with no <a target="_self" href="../../POINTS/THESAURUS/miscellaneous_payments.html">down payment</a>. Tony was delighted. From then on, it was interesting to see that any <a target="_self" href="../../POINTS/THESAURUS/to_get_rid_of_something_or_someone.html">discarded</a> odds and ends around our place&#151;a broken screen, a bit of hardware, boards from packing&#151;Tony would gather and take home.</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">22</span> After about two years, I found Tony in our familiar meeting spot. He seemed to stand a little <a target="_self" href="../../POINTS/THESAURUS/straight%2c_upright_and_level.html">straighter</a>. He was heavier. He had a look of confidence.</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">23</span> "Mr. Craw, I sell my house!" he said with pride. "I got $8,000."</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">24</span> I was amazed. "But, Tony, where are you going to live without a house?"</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">25</span> "Mr. Craw, I buy a farm."</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">26</span> We sat down and talked. Tony told me that to own a farm was his dream. He loved the tomatoes and peppers and all the other vegetables important to his Italian diet. He had sent for his wife and son and daughter back in Italy. He had hunted around the edge of town until he found a small, <a target="_self" href="../../POINTS/THESAURUS/empty_of_people_or_things.html">abandoned</a> piece of property with a house and shed. Now he was moving his family to his farm.</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">27</span> Sometime later, Tony arrived on a Sunday afternoon, neatly dressed. He had another Italian man with him. He told me that he had persuaded his childhood friend to move to America. Tony was <a target="_self" href="../../POINTS/THESAURUS/to_support_an_idea%2c_plan_or_person.html">sponsoring</a> him. With an amused look in his eye, he told me that when they approached the little farm he now operated, his friend stood in amazement and said, "Tony, you are a millionaire!"</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">28</span> Then, during the war, a message came from my company. Tony had <a target="_self" href="../../POINTS/THESAURUS/to_die_or_to_be_killed.html">passed away</a>.</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">29</span> I asked our people to check on his family and see that everything was properly handled. They found the farm green with vegetables, the little house <a target="_self" href="../../POINTS/THESAURUS/making_you_feel_comfortable.html">livable</a> and <a target="_self" href="../../POINTS/THESAURUS/pleasant%2c_enjoyable_and_relaxing.html">homey</a>. There was a tractor and a good car in the yard. The children were educated and working, and Tony didn't owe a cent.</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">30</span> After he passed away, I thought more and more about Tony's career. He grew in stature in my mind. In the end, I think he stood as tall, and as proud, as the greatest American industrialists.</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">31</span> They had all reached their success by the same route and by the same values and principles: vision, determination, self-control, optimism, self-respect and, above all, <a target="_self" href="../../POINTS/THESAURUS/morally_good_or_correct_behaviour.html">integrity</a>.</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">32</span> Tony did not begin on the bottom rung of the ladder. He began in the basement. Tony's affairs were tiny; the greatest industrialists' affairs were giant. But, after all, the balance sheets were exactly the same. The only difference was where you put the decimal point.</p>
		<p class="z"><span class="lN">33</span> Tony Trivisonno came to America seeking the American Dream. But he didn't find it&#151;he created it for himself. All he had were 24 precious hours a day, and he wasted none of them.</p>
