<p class="storyTitle">Chapter Twenty</p>

<p>I'm surprised to wake before Luke. We have to be at yoga in an hour, but I can't resist lying here and watching him sleep.</p>

<p>The early morning light filters in through his floor to ceiling windows. I love his large bedroom with its large-scale furniture. The bed is enormous, the white sheets feel like Egyptian cotton and they are soft against my skin.</p>

<p>Luke lies on his back, one hand flung over his head. His face is soft in sleep, his morning stubble so sexy along his jaw, and his usually messy hair even messier than usual.</p>

<p>And he loves me!</p>

<p>I saunter into the bathroom to answer nature's call, and when I walk back into the bedroom I pick up the scattered clothes, shoes and hairpins from last night, a huge grin plastered on my face.</p>

<p>I notice one of my small suitcases is sitting on a chair near the windows, and I make a mental note to thank Jules.</p>

<p>I am happy to find my yoga gear, fresh underwear and other casual clothes and toiletries, including a toothbrush, all new, in the suitcase. I decide to unpack and settle in a bit. If he wants me to move back out, fine. If he wants to move some stuff into my place, that's fine too.</p>

<p>I add my toothbrush and a stick of deodorant to his vanity and a bottle of body wash and shampoo to the shower. Jules must have gone shopping for all this last night, and I not only mentally thank her, I plan to surprise her with a special treat.</p>

<p>I leave the clothes in the suitcase, but pull on my yoga gear and look back over to the bed.</p>

<p>Luke's still asleep, and we still have plenty of time, so I leave him be and head downstairs to make coffee.</p>

<p>I poke around his kitchen, opening espresso-colored cabinets, and finally locate the coffee and maker, get it set to drip and find some mugs as well. As the coffee perks I open the French door out to the deck and step out to enjoy the view of the beautiful Puget Sound and take a deep breath of fresh air.</p>

<p>It's a beautiful day. The sky is a brilliant blue, as the morning sun is up fully and shining on the deep blue water. The ferry is gliding gracefully toward Bainbridge Island. Seagulls fly over the water, and the breeze is blowing gently through my hair. It's a glorious day.</p>

<p>"I thought you weren't a morning person."</p>

<p>I spin at the sound of his rough, sexy voice. He enfolds me in his arms and hugs me close.</p>

<p>"Good morning, handsome."</p>

<p>"Good morning, baby."</p>

<p>Leaning my head back, I grin up at him. "I'm making coffee."</p>

<p>"So I smell. Thank you. Why didn't you wake me?" He kisses my forehead and takes a deep breath.</p>

<p>"You looked so peaceful, and we're in no hurry."</p>

<p>"You unpacked."</p>

<p>I lean my head against his chest, avoiding his gaze. "Yeah, I can repack if you'd rather I didn't leave my stuff here."</p>

<p>He grips my chin in his fingers and tips my head back, brushing my lips with his in a kiss that makes my toes curl.</p>

<p>"I like having your stuff here. Leave it."</p>

<p>"Okay." I smile shyly at him. "Let's get some coffee."</p>

<hr/>

<p>"<span class="smallCaps">Are you ready</span>?" I grin at Luke, who's now dressed in loose, black basketball shorts and a tank top. He looks fantastic.</p>

<p>"As I'll ever be." He looks nervous and my heart melts.</p>

<p>"You'll be fine. Just remember what I said, go at your own pace, and stretch only as far as is comfortable. I don't want you to get hurt."</p>

<p>"I won't get hurt."</p>

<p>"Okay." I know he thinks this is going to be a piece of cake. I have no doubt that he's in excellent physical condition, but yoga is more physically demanding than most people realize.</p>

<p>I unlock the studio and usher him in. The glass windows are all frosted so people walking by can't stop and stare. There are mirrors covering one whole wall with a barre mounted to it for the afternoon ballet class, and yoga mats rolled up and stacked in a corner. I walk over to the sound system and choose some calming music.</p>

<p>"Okay, let's grab our mats. Clients will start trickling in soon."</p>

<p>"How many people usually attend this class?"</p>

<p>I can sense his unease about being recognized. "Only about eight or ten. It's a small class."</p>

<p>He nods and we spread out our mats, me in the front of the class by the mirrors, and him in front of me. Clients walk in and grab mats, spread all over the studio. No one even pays any attention to Luke and I see him relax. I smile at him reassuringly and he winks back at me.</p>

<p>"Okay, everyone, let's get started." For the next hour I lead the class through the series of poses, varying my poses to accommodate both novice and experienced clients. I typically lose myself to the music and the flow of the yoga itself, but I can't help but be distracted by Luke and his strong body. He's more flexible than I gave him credit for and he's graceful. And watching his toned body move and flex is a delight.</p>

<p>He's watching me too, with more interest than just to see which pose I'm moving in to. When our eyes meet the heat is unmistakable and I know I'm turning him on as much as he's turning me on.</p>

<p>I can't wait to get him alone.</p>

<p>I'm in the downward dog pose and I turn to look out over the class, and see that Luke's gaze is on my ass.</p>

<p>I smirk.</p>

<p>Finally, class is over and I'm so turned on I can hardly see straight. The clients all wave goodbye and shuffle out to get on with their day and finally Luke and I are left alone. He walks over to the door and flips the lock and my heart does a big ol' flip in my chest.</p>

<p>"Is there another class in here this morning?" he asks.</p>

<p>"No, not until this afternoon," I respond.</p>

<p>"Good."</p>

<p>"What did you think?" I ask.</p>

<p>"I think," he begins as he walks slowly toward me, "that you are the sexiest woman I've ever seen in my life."</p>

<p>His eyes narrow and his face is serious as he stalks over to me.</p>

<p>"Oh." I try to gather my wits. "So, I take it you liked it?"</p>

<p>"I had no idea you could move that gorgeous little body of yours like that."</p>

<p>"I've been doing this for a long time."</p>

<p>"Yeah, I see." He's finally standing less than a foot away from me and I reach up to run my hand down his face.</p>

<p>"I'm glad you were here. It was a pleasure to watch you move."</p>

<p>He smiles, delighted with me, and cups my hand in his own, leaning into my touch and closing his eyes for just a few moments. He opens those baby blues and they are now on fire.</p>

<p>Holy hell, I love it when he looks at me like that.</p>

<p>He backs me up against the mirror and clasps my face in his hands, kissing me as if his life depends on it. I grip onto his hips with my hands and give myself over to his kiss, pouring all my frustration from the past hour into it.</p>

<p>"I want you," he murmurs against my lips.</p>

<p>"I've wanted you for the past hour. I'm surprised I was able to speak during class."</p>

<p>He smiles against my lips. "Let's take these off, shall we?"</p>

<p>He pulls my tank and sports bra over my head and throws them on the ground then makes quick work of my pants and underwear. I repay the favor, divesting him of his black workout clothes and he spins me around to face the mirror.</p>

<p>"Put your hands on the bar, baby."</p>

<p>I gladly comply. He kisses my shoulder and wraps his arms around my front, cupping my breasts in his hands and worrying the sensitive nipples with his fingers. Watching our reflection in the mirror sends electricity straight to my groin. His large bronze hands span across my chest, cupping my white breasts. His lips are on my shoulder, his eyes closed, and the look on his face is primal and needy and <i>oh my.</i></p>

<p>"Ah!" I lean my head back against his chest, pushing my breasts into his hands.</p>

<p>"You made me crazy watching you in all those poses, baby. I don't know how I managed to control my hard on."</p>

<p>I gasp and smile at him in the mirror.</p>

<p>He glides a hand down my side, tracing my tattoo, over my hip, across my buttock and finds my center.</p>

<p>"Fuck, baby, you're so ready for me." His lips are on my neck, nibbling, sending shivers down my spine.</p>

<p>Suddenly, he pulls back on my hips so I'm bent over, bracing my hands on the bar, and he smacks my ass hard before slamming his cock into me.</p>

<p>"Oh, God!"</p>

<p>He grips my hair in one hand and my hip in the other and pushes into me, faster and faster, harder and harder, his stormy eyes on mine in the mirror.</p>

<p>Fuck, it feels so good! I push back on him and feel the orgasm rip through me, fast, hard and I explode around him.</p>

<p>He thrusts twice more and shudders in his own release.</p>

<hr/>

<p><span class="smallCaps">As we leave the yoga studio</span>, I get a text from Jules.</p>

<p class="styleItalic">Birthday dinner at the folks' tomorrow night? Bring Luke.</p>

<p>I frown. How do I bring this up?</p>

<p>"What's wrong?" He ushers me into his car and leans in to kiss me before getting behind the wheel.</p>

<p>"Nothing's wrong."</p>

<p>He raises an eyebrow at me and I squirm.</p>

<p>"Talk to me, baby."</p>

<p>"Jules' parents have invited us over to their place for dinner tomorrow night."</p>

<p>"Oh? What's the occasion?" He starts the car and pulls out of the lot toward his house.</p>

<p>"My birthday," I whisper and bite my lip.</p>

<p>"What?" He glances over at me, his eyes wide, then back to the road ahead.</p>

<p>"Well, it's not really until Saturday, but they want to do a birthday dinner tomorrow night." I twist my fingers in my lap and gaze down. This is uncomfortable.</p>

<p>"Are you close to her family?"</p>

<p>"Yeah, they pretty much adopted me after my folks passed." This is much easier to talk about. "Her parents are great. She has four older brothers. The oldest, Isaac, and his wife just had a baby. I haven't met her yet."</p>

<p>"So it'll be a family thing."</p>

<p>Oh, what is he thinking? He doesn't look mad, but he doesn't look pleased.</p>

<p>"Yes. Will you go with me?"</p>

<p>"Of course. Sounds fun. But when were you going to tell me your birthday is this weekend?"</p>

<p>Oh.</p>

<p>I shrug and look out the window. "I hadn't really thought about it, honestly. I don't make a big deal out of it."</p>

<p>"Maybe I want to make a big deal out of it." His voice is deceptively soft.</p>

<p>"Don't be mad," I whisper. "It would make me feel stupid to say, 'So, let's go to yoga, and by the way, my birthday is Saturday.'".</p>

<p>"No, that would have been helpful." He pulls up to my house, dropping me off so I can work. He grabs Jules' dress and my shoes out of the back and we go inside.</p>

<p>"So, I guess we're going to the dinner tomorrow night?"</p>

<p>"Yeah we are." He hugs me tight.</p>

<p>"Thank you. Do you have much work today?" I ask, trying to distract him.</p>

<p>"Yeah, some. You?"</p>

<p>"I have two sessions, and I have to take Jules' dress to the cleaners."</p>

<p>He frowns deeply. "Jules' dress?"</p>

<p>Crap.</p>

<p>"Yeah, she lent it to me."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Because I don't have any formal wear." I shrug. "It's no big deal."</p>

<p>"I don't want you to have to borrow clothes." He narrows his eyes and plants his hands on his hips.</p>

<p>"Luke, that's what girls do. We borrow each other's clothes. It's no big deal."</p>

<p>"I want to take you shopping for your birthday."</p>

<p>"No." I shake my head emphatically and walk toward the kitchen.</p>

<p>"Why ever not?"</p>

<p>"You do not need to buy me clothes. I can buy three thousand dollar shoes without batting an eye, Luke. I don't need you to clothe me."</p>

<p>"I didn't say you needed me to. I'm your boyfriend for Christ sake. That's what we do. Let me spoil you."</p>

<p>"You do spoil me." I smile as I remember the flowers, the coffee, dinner last night. "You spoil me in all the ways that matter."</p>

<p>"Nat, I'm very wealthy. I can afford to spend money on you."</p>

<p>"Ditto." I cross my arms over my chest.</p>

<p>"You are so fucking stubborn!" He shakes his head and runs his hand through his hair and I can't help but be amused.</p>

<p>"Are you smirking?" he asks.</p>

<p>"Kind of. You're funny when you're irritated with me."</p>

<p>He laughs and looks at the ceiling. "God, you're frustrating."</p>

<p>"I know. But I love you."</p>

<p>His eyes soften and he pulls me into his arms. "I love you too."</p>

<p>I lean up and kiss him sweetly on the lips, then the corner of his mouth.</p>

<p>"I'm serious, baby. Take my credit card, grab Jules and go shopping. Both of you, on me, for your birthday."</p>

<p>I open my mouth to argue but Jules breezes into the kitchen. "Okay, don't have to tell me twice. Thanks." She winks at him and grins.</p>

<p>"Hey! No way. I mean it."</p>

<p>"Jules, do you have plans tomorrow before dinner at your parents?" Luke is talking to her but looking at me, his jaw set.</p>

<p>I am so going to lose this argument.</p>

<p>"Nope. I happen to have a clear calendar." She smiles.</p>

<p>"Great. Will you please take my girlfriend shopping? And I think the spa is in order too."</p>

<p>The spa too? My jaw drops.</p>

<p>"It would be an honor and a pleasure, generous boyfriend-in-law." Jules laughs at her quip and Luke joins her, and all I can do is look back and forth between them.</p>

<p>"I'm in the Goddamn room, people!"</p>

<p>"I know, baby, I'm just planning a little something for your birthday." He flashes a wolfish smile and winks and I don't know whether to smack him or really kiss him.</p>

<p>"I like your boyfriend, Nat." Jules smiles at me sweetly and I know I'm sunk.</p>

<p>"Fine," I mutter.</p>

<p>"Your enthusiasm is inspiring." Luke's eyes are shining in humor.</p>

<p>"We'll go to the spa, but no shopping." I'm really hoping he'll accept the compromise, but I can see by the set of his jaw that there's no use in arguing.</p>

<p>"You will shop. Buy whatever you want. There's no limit on the card."</p>

<p>I shake my head at him. "Talk about stubborn."</p>

<p>He shrugs and kisses me hard, then pulls away abruptly, leaving me off balance.</p>

<p>"Will you come to my place when your sessions are over?"</p>

<p>"Yeah, I'll text you when I'm done." I sigh, resigned to my fate tomorrow. I know that Jules will make me follow Luke's instructions.</p>

<p>Traitor.</p>

<p>"Good. I'll see you later." He kisses me again and rests his forehead on mine. "I love you, beautiful."</p>

<p>And just like that my world is set right again, and in this moment I'd do just about anything he wanted.</p>

<p>"I love you too, bossy man."</p>
