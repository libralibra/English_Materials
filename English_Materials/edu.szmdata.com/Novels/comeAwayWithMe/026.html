<p class="storyTitle">Chapter Twenty-Five</p>

<p>I've decided that being back in the real world does not suck.</p>

<p>We've been home from our romantic Tahitian getaway for a week, and we have fallen into a comfortable routine of work, flirty texts throughout the workday, hitting the gym or yoga together and alternating between his place and mine at night.</p>

<p>Tonight, we're staying at my place, and we're having dinner with Jules.</p>

<p>"That is not how you cook pasta!" Jules looks beautiful, as usual, as she glares at my boyfriend and I smirk.</p>

<p>"How the hell do you do it?" Luke is thoroughly frustrated with her and I'm sitting back with a glass of wine enjoying the show.</p>

<p>"You have to put the salt in the water before it comes to a boil. Everyone knows that."</p>

<p>"You know what, you do it. I'm going to make out with my girlfriend." He leaves Jules to finish dinner and comes around the breakfast bar to kiss me.</p>

<p>"Is she being mean to you?" I ask and caress his face.</p>

<p>"No, she just doesn't know how to cook and won't listen."</p>

<p>"I can hear, you know." Jules glares at us and we laugh.</p>

<p>I love spending evenings with these two. They both mean the world to me and I love it that they get along so well.</p>

<p>"So, Luke, when does your new movie come out?" Jules is stirring the pasta.</p>

<p>"This Friday," he responds and takes a sip of wine.</p>

<p>"What?" I exclaim. I had no idea! Why doesn't he tell me these things?</p>

<p>"Um, I have a movie coming out on Friday."</p>

<p>I stare at him, dumbfounded.</p>

<p>Jules looks back and forth between us and then mutters, "Oops."</p>

<p>"Why didn't you say something?" My feelings are so hurt.</p>

<p>"It didn't occur to me." He frowns and shrugs.</p>

<p>"You have a major motion picture about to be released for millions of people to see, and it didn't occur to you to mention it to your girlfriend?" I turn and face him on my stool.</p>

<p>What the hell?</p>

<p>"I just did some of the production; I'm not starring in it or anything."</p>

<p>"I don't care, Luke. This is a big deal. Are you going to the premier?"</p>

<p>"No, absolutely not." He shakes his head and runs his hand through his hair.</p>

<p>"Why? You should go. You're a part of it."</p>

<p>"No." He swallows hard. "I don't do that anymore."</p>

<p>"Either way, you should have told me. You never talk to me about your work, and you know all about mine." This is something that's been bothering me, and I'm glad Jules brought it up.</p>

<p>"What does a producer do, anyway?" Jules asks as she drains the pasta and starts layering lasagna in a glass dish.</p>

<p>"It depends on the producer. There are a lot of different roles. Some are on set during the entire production and run things there. Some work behind the scenes, securing money from a studio or wooing actors and directors. There are a lot of things to do, and there are usually a few producers doing different jobs."</p>

<p>"Okay, so what do you do, specifically?" I ask, sincerely interested.</p>

<p>"I've been doing the behind the scenes, pre-production stuff so I can work from here. Sometimes I have to make a trip to L.A. or New York for a brief meeting, but that's rare these days. Pretty much everything can be done on the phone or email. So, I talk to actors and directors, and sometimes sit in on conference calls to get money secured for a project." He's talking with his hands, so animated and enthusiastic, and it occurs to me, he really loves what he does. I smile at him and kiss his cheek.</p>

<p>"I'm proud of you."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Because you're doing something you love and you're good at it."</p>

<p>"How do you know?"</p>

<p>"I wouldn't be with someone who sucks." I respond sassily and he laughs.</p>

<p>"So, how much money did you have to secure for the movie coming out on Friday? And who's in it anyway?" Jules slips the lasagna in the oven and leans across the counter listening attentively.</p>

<p>"It's called <i>Rough Shot</i> with Channing Tatum. It's an action, lots of stunts and stuff blowing up, so it was high budget. About a hundred million."</p>

<p>Jules and I look at each other and then back at Luke.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, did you say a hundred million dollars?" My voice is very shrill. It's disturbing. Almost as disturbing as my boyfriend being responsible for raising a hundred million dollars.</p>

<p>"Yeah." He smiles shyly. "The action adventure movies are always high budget because there's a lot of cinematography involved, CGI, and a lot of other stuff that I don't really understand but know it's expensive."</p>

<p>I swallow. Wow.</p>

<p>"So, this is a big box office movie then."</p>

<p>"Yeah, it's expected to bring in about a hundred and fifty million this weekend." He shrugs again, but I see the pride in his eyes.</p>

<p>"So, here's where I get personal, and you can tell me to mind my own fucking business, but I'm curious because money is what I do for a living." Jules' eyes are gleaming with curiosity and I know exactly what she's going to ask.</p>

<p>"Okay, go ahead." Luke smirks. He knows too.</p>

<p>"Well, I know how much actors usually get paid for big budget films, but what about producers?"</p>

<p>"When all is said and done, after royalties and stuff, from this movie I'll probably bank about fifteen."</p>

<p>I narrow my eyes at him and bite my lip, not sure that I understand the words that just came out of his mouth. I look at Jules, and her mouth is opening and closing, also with no sound coming out.</p>

<p>Luke isn't looking at either of us. He's staring down at his wine.</p>

<p>Finally, Jules speaks first. "Please tell me you have a damn good entertainment lawyer and a team of entertainment accountants with excellent reputations. Because if you don't, I know some." She's completely serious.</p>

<p>Luke nods his head. "Yeah, that's all been covered for years."</p>

<p>"Good," she responds.</p>

<p>I just don't know what to say. I knew he was wealthy, but I had no idea.</p>

<p>Finally, Luke looks over at me. "Are you okay?"</p>

<p>"Fine," I whisper.</p>

<p>"You look a little pale." He looks worried.</p>

<p>"I'm okay." I shake myself out of my stare and look to Jules for guidance.</p>

<p>"Nat," she says, "You're no stranger to money."</p>

<p>"No, I'm not."</p>

<p>"Your parents left you like twenty million."</p>

<p>Luke blanches.</p>

<p>"I know."</p>

<p>"So, what's wrong?" she asks quietly.</p>

<p>I frown. "Well, I guess it's just a lot to take in." I look at Luke and finally, needing to touch him, grip his hand in mine. "I'm sorry, honey. The money isn't that big of a deal to me, you know that. I guess it's just surprising to hear that my man deals with actors and hundred million dollar movies and is friends with Steven Spielberg. It's easy to forget because we're so far removed from that life."</p>

<p>"Nat, I've removed myself on purpose."</p>

<p>"I know."</p>

<p>"Don't freak out on me," he whispers.</p>

<p>"I am not freaking out on you." I smile, finding my equilibrium.</p>

<p>"Um, can I ask one more question?" Jules raises her hand like we're in class and we laugh.</p>

<p>"Okay."</p>

<p>"Can I have Channing Tatum's number?"</p>

<p>We all bust out in a laughing fit, and I'm relieved to have the tension lifted.</p>

<p>"He's married, Jules."</p>

<p>"Damn it." She frowns. "All the good ones are taken."</p>

<p>"Luke"&#151;I jump off my stool and stand between his thighs, rubbing my hands up and down his arms&#151;"I want to see your movie this weekend."</p>

<p>"You do?" He looks completely shocked.</p>

<p>"Yes. This is what you do. I want to support you. Let's go opening night."</p>

<p>"I told you, I don't do premiers. I'm not going to L.A. for it." He's shaking his head adamantly.</p>

<p>"No, I mean here. Let's go to opening night here, in Seattle."</p>

<p>Jules jumps up and down in excitement. "I want to go too! I'm sure I can find a date."</p>

<p>"Let's make a night of it. We'll double date, go to the movie, maybe dinner. Let's celebrate!"</p>

<p>Luke smiles, a wide melt-my-panties smile and for the first time since I met him, he looks genuinely proud and excited about what he does. "You really want to?"</p>

<p>"Absolutely."</p>

<p>"Then I guess we're going. But let's try to go to an out of the way theater. I don't want our night to be ruined because I get recognized and have to stand around signing shit for three hours."</p>

<p>"We'll go to a late show in a suburb after dinner. You can wear a trench coat with a hat and sunglasses." I smirk at him and he narrows his eyes at me.</p>

<p>"You're such a smart-ass."</p>

<p>"But you love me." I smile sweetly.</p>

<p>"God, get a room." Jules pulls the lasagna out of the oven.</p>

<hr/>

<p>"I'm nervous." I look over at Jules and cringe. "What if I don't like it?"</p>

<p>"Then you lie through your pretty straight teeth and tell him you love it. That's what girlfriends do, no matter what their boyfriends do for a living." She shuffles through my closet looking for something to wear to the movie tonight.</p>

<p>"Who are you bringing tonight?" I ask as I pull my black dress over my head and step into my black Manolo Blahniks.</p>

<p>"Don't lecture me."</p>

<p>"Uh, okay."</p>

<p>"I'm bringing my boss."</p>

<p>"Holy shit! I didn't think you were seeing him anymore." What the hell?</p>

<p>"We're not really seeing each other."</p>

<p>"Are you sleeping together?"</p>

<p>"No. Definitely not. He's not as bad as I thought he was. Once the embarrassment faded...well, he's a pretty nice guy. I figured why not bring him." She bites her lip and slips on a pair of my silver earrings.</p>

<p>"I hope you know what you're doing, Jules."</p>

<p>"I'm not sure that I do, but it's just one night. Please, be cool, okay?"</p>

<p>"I am the epitome of cool. I'm offended you'd say otherwise. And here I was going to spring for dinner tonight, too."</p>

<p>She smiles at me as the doorbell rings.</p>

<p>"One of our guys is here," I head for the door, ready to go. "I'll get it."</p>

<p>I jog down the stairs and open the door to find a huge bouquet of red roses staring me in the face.</p>

<p>"Well, hello."</p>

<p>Luke pokes his head out from behind them and smiles at me. "Hey, gorgeous, these are for you."</p>

<p>"Thank you, my love." I bury my nose in them and sniff as he comes inside and closes the door behind him. He looks fantastic in a blue button down shirt that matches his eyes and a pair of khaki pants.</p>

<p>"You look handsome," I murmur and kiss his lips softly.</p>

<p>"You are breathtaking." He runs his fingertips down my face and I blush.</p>

<p>"Come on, I'll put these in water and then I get to go see my boyfriend's movie tonight."</p>

<p>Luke laughs. "You do? That's cool."</p>

<p>"I know. He's very famous, but I can't tell you who he is because we are private people." I nod sagely at him, my eyes wide.</p>

<p>"Are you sure I can't get it out of you?" He wraps his arms around my middle as I arrange the flowers in a vase.</p>

<p>"Nope, my lips are sealed."</p>

<p>"Damn, and here I was hoping to get to take you out tonight." He nuzzles my neck and I sigh.</p>

<p>"Well, I could probably go out with you later, after my other date."</p>

<p>Luke tickles my ribs and I squeal. "Like hell. You're mine, baby. Get used to it."</p>

<p>I turn in his arms and run my hands through his hair, smiling up at him. "You are the only one I'll ever want, my love."</p>

<p>His eyes soften and he gives me that kiss that makes me all gooey. "Ditto, baby."</p>

<p>"Oh my God, do you two ever stop?" Jules rolls her eyes as she comes in the room and Luke smiles smugly and kisses my cheek.</p>

<p>"Nope."</p>

<p>"Gag. Nate just texted, he'll be here in a few&#151;"</p>

<p>Just then the doorbell rings.</p>

<p>"He'll be here right now. I'll get it." She smiles and saunters to the front door.</p>

<p>"Who's the guy?" Luke asks.</p>

<p>"A guy she works with." I respond and Luke's eyebrows shoot up.</p>

<p>"Really?"</p>

<p>"Yeah. Could be interesting."</p>

<p>"Come on in and meet them." Jules walks into the kitchen ahead of a very attractive man wearing dark jeans and a black long-sleeved button down shirt. He's tall like Luke with broad shoulders and slender hips, has long dark, dark hair pulled back in a short pony tail at the nape of his neck, gray eyes and a nice, square jaw. Yes, he's swoon-worthy like Jules said before. He also has kind eyes, and he can't take them off of Jules' face as she introduces him to us.</p>

<p>He's smitten.</p>

<p>"Nate, this is my roommate, Natalie, and her boyfriend, Luke Williams."</p>

<p>Nate shakes both our hands and smiles at Luke. "It's a pleasure. I can't say I was a fan of the movies you acted in years ago, but I do love the ones you produce now. I've been waiting for <i>Rough Shot</i> to come out for months." He smiles at us both and then steps back to drop his arm around Jules' shoulders.</p>

<p>"Here's hoping you like it." Luke seems relaxed and I breathe an internal sigh of relief.</p>

<p>"Shall we go? I'm starving."</p>

<p>"Let's go." Luke takes my hand and we all climb into his Mercedes SUV, me in the front with Luke and Jules and Nate in the back.</p>

<p>"Where would you like to eat?" Luke asks us.</p>

<p>I turn my head to answer and see Nate kiss Jules' hand. Just friends my ass. I'll drill her later.</p>

<p>"How about that little Mexican place you took me to last week?" I suggest. "It's quiet and they have delicious margaritas."</p>

<p>Both Jules and Nate nod in agreement.</p>

<p>"Mexican it is." Luke picks up my hand and kisses my knuckles and I smile shyly at him.</p>

<p>The restaurant is relatively slow for a Friday night. The owners know Luke, so they escort us to a private booth near the back where we won't be noticed.</p>

<p>After chips and salsa have been delivered, and we've all ordered, we sit back to sip margaritas and get to know Nate.</p>

<p>"So, Nate, what is it that you do?" Luke asks.</p>

<p>"I work at the same investment firm as Julianne," he responds and smiles down at Jules.</p>

<p>My eyebrows climb into my hairline and I meet Jules' gaze with my own.</p>

<p><i>Julianne?</i> No one calls her that.</p>

<p>Jules narrows her eyes at me, telepathically telling me to shut up.</p>

<p>"How long have you been doing that?" Luke asks, oblivious to our silent conversation.</p>

<p>"About eight years."</p>

<p>We make small talk for the better part of our meal. Nate is polite, attentive, and clearly completely taken with Jules.</p>

<p>And it's completely mutual.</p>

<p>Luke lays his hand on my thigh and squeezes and I link my fingers through his.</p>

<p>"Do you sail?" Nate asks out of the blue.</p>

<p>"I've been a few times, but I haven't in a while," Luke says. "You?"</p>

<p>"Yes, actually, I have a catamaran docked in Seattle. Would you two like to join us one afternoon for a tour around the Sound?"</p>

<p>Luke looks down at me to get my take and I nod and smile, catching Jules' slight nod.</p>

<p>"Sounds fun," Luke replies.</p>

<p>The check arrives but I pluck it off the table before anyone else can.</p>

<p>"You're not paying for this." Luke digs for his wallet but I hold the check away from him.</p>

<p>"Yes, I am. We're celebrating your movie premiere, so I get to pay."</p>

<p>"Fuck no, give me that check."</p>

<p>"Mine." I hold it against my chest as I pull my card out of my wallet.</p>

<p>"Goddamn it, Nat..."</p>

<p>I pull his face down to mine and kiss him long and slow. When I pull back we're both out of breath. "Let me do this. I'm proud of you, damn it."</p>

<p>"I can't argue with you when you do that." He mutters and looks disgusted, but I see the gleam of humor in his impossibly blue eyes and I smile smugly as I pass the check and my card to the waitress.</p>

<p>Nate watches our exchange with curiosity and then breaks out in a wide grin.</p>

<p>"Dude, you've got it bad." He says to Luke.</p>

<p>"You have no idea," Luke grumbles.</p>
