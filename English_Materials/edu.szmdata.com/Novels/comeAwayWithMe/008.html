<p class="storyTitle">Chapter Seven</p>

<p>Holy Hell, he's a man on a mission.</p>

<p>Luke is dragging me through the house, breathing hard, his eyes feral.</p>

<p>"Your bedroom?" he repeats, and I point up the stairs, unable to articulate words.</p>

<p>I don't remember my own name! And he hasn't even touched me.</p>

<p>Wow.</p>

<p>As he pulls me up the stairs, I get a great view of his tight ass, and my stomach clenches.</p>

<p>"To the right," I finally find my voice and he pulls me into my bedroom, shuts and locks the door, and pulls me to him.</p>

<p>There's still plenty of light coming in the windows off the blue waters of the sound, and for just a moment I stand with his arms around my waist, my hands on his broad shoulders, and drink in the sight of his beautiful face.</p>

<p>"You're so handsome," I whisper.</p>

<p>He grins at me and leans down to nuzzle my neck, gently walking me backward to the bed. Thank God I made it this morning!</p>

<p>I'm expecting him to push me back onto the bed, but instead he steps back from me, not touching me at all, and his burning eyes run up and down my body, finally landing on my own eyes.</p>

<p>"Are you sure about this?"</p>

<p>What? "Are you having doubts?"</p>

<p>"Hell, no, I just want to make sure this is what you want, baby. If you say no, that's fine, but please, God, don't say no."</p>

<p>Oh wow. He's giving me control, and I don't know if it's because of what I told him in the car, or if he's just being chivalrous, and frankly, I don't care. This is my choice.</p>

<p><i>He</i> is my choice.</p>

<p>Staring him square in the eye, I say with a surprisingly sure voice, "Luke, please get us naked and make love to me."</p>

<p>He smiles, that huge, heart-stopping smile and whips his T-shirt over his head.</p>

<p>Whoa!</p>

<p>He's all lean muscle and broad shoulders. His stomach is sculpted, with those incredibly sexy lines that run down the hips and to his cock. His arms are muscular...he's just so...<i>strong</i>.</p>

<p>I raise my hand to touch him, but he shakes his head, still smiling. "If you touch me, this will go much faster than either of us wants."</p>

<p>Oh. "We have all night."</p>

<p>"And we'll be taking advantage of it, baby, trust me. But this first time is going to be special."</p>

<p>I start to take my shirt off and he stops me. "I'd like to do that."</p>

<p>"Well then hurry up!" I hear the whine in my voice, but can't stop it, and I can't help but laugh with him.</p>

<p>"My pleasure," he shucks off his shorts and underwear in one fast movement, and suddenly I'm getting a front-row view of Luke in all his glory.</p>

<p>He is simply a Greek God. His body is perfect in every way.</p>

<p>And he wants me!</p>

<p>He walks to me and grabs the hem of my shirt, pulling it over my head. He runs his fingers under my bra straps and leans in to nibble on my neck, just under my ear lobe.</p>

<p>"Luke," I murmur.</p>

<p>"Easy, baby." He reaches behind me, deftly unclasps my bra and peels it down my arms. He makes quick work of my shorts and panties, pushing his hands between the fabric and my ass, cupping it, then slowly gliding them down my legs.</p>

<p>Oh, he's good with his hands!</p>

<p>He stands back up, and lifts me and suddenly I'm cradled in his arms. I wrap my arms around his neck, and he kisses my lips softly as he lowers me onto the bed.</p>

<p>"Sweet Jesus, you're beautiful, Nat," he whispers this against my throat and I can do nothing but close my eyes and grip on to the blanket beneath me.</p>

<p>"Let's find those tattoos."</p>

<p>I smile as he kisses and licks his way down to my breasts, then gasp as he tugs one nipple firmly into his mouth and laves it with his expert tongue. Lightning shoots straight to my groin, and my hips start to shimmy of their own accord. I moan his name and twist his soft blonde hair in my fingers.</p>

<p>"Hush, baby," he runs his hand down the opposite breast and tweaks it with his thumb.</p>

<p>"Oh, God!"</p>

<p>My body's response to him is overwhelming.</p>

<p>I feel him smile against my skin, and he moves down, suddenly rolling me onto my right side. "What have we here?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps another tattoo?" My voice cracks as he runs his hand from my left hip to my shoulder.</p>

<p>"What does it say, baby?"</p>

<p>It's script, as are all of my tats, that runs up my ribs, but I'm too busy trying to remember to breathe to talk.</p>

<p>"Natalie, what does it say?" he kisses each letter gently, arms wrapped around my hips, braced on his elbows.</p>

<p>"It says, 'Be happy for this moment.'"</p>

<p>I groan, and continue. "'This moment is your life.'"</p>

<p>"In what language?" His finger is rubbing it now. Oh wow.</p>

<p>"Sanskrit."</p>

<p>"Mmm...turn onto your stomach."</p>

<p>I oblige and groan as he kisses my shoulder, over to my spine and starts working his way down, down, down.</p>

<p>"God, your mouth feels good," I groan and I feel him smile against my sensitive skin.</p>

<p>"And this?" He nibbles between my shoulder blades.</p>

<p>"It's Greek."</p>

<p>"What does it say, beautiful?" Oh, God, his hands are just everywhere, my skin is on fire, and he wants me to talk?</p>

<p>"Love deeply."</p>

<p>"You're so fucking sexy, Nat."</p>

<p>"You're making me feel pretty fucking sexy, Luke."</p>

<p>He nibbles his way down to my low back.</p>

<p>"No tramp stamp?" I hear his smile.</p>

<p>"Hell, no." I respond.</p>

<p>He plants open-mouthed, wet kisses my left buttock, then my right, and then I hear his breath catch.</p>

<p>"Christ, baby."</p>

<p>He nibbles my upper thigh, just under my right buttock and I about come up off the bed.</p>

<p>"Easy. What's this one?"</p>

<p>I smile. "A tattoo."</p>

<p>"Oh, you are a smart-ass." He slaps me on the ass, hard, and I gasp.</p>

<p>"Ah!" I look back at him in shock, my eyes wide, and he grins.</p>

<p>"What does it say?" He raises an eyebrow, daring me to make a sassy retort, and I swallow.</p>

<p>Holy fuck, no one's ever spanked me before. It's...<i>hot</i>.</p>

<p>"'Happiness Is a Journey'," I whisper. "In French."</p>

<p>He groans and kisses it tenderly. I lay back down, flat on the bed and enjoy the nibbles and kisses Luke leaves up and down my legs. He stops and gives the arch of my right foot extra special attention again, making me grin and want to clench my legs closed at the same time.</p>

<p>Suddenly he flips me onto my back and he raises my left foot up, bending my knee, and kisses my ankle, slowly moving up my leg. He is a wonder to watch as he worships my skin.</p>

<p>His eyes narrow when he catches sight of my belly button piercing, but then they darken when he sees my freshly waxed pubis.</p>

<p>"Oh honey, what's this?"</p>

<p>I start to respond with my witty tattoo retort, but it's caught in my throat when he bends that sexy blond head over and ever so gently rains tiny kisses over the one word scripted on my pubis.</p>

<p>"It says, 'Forgive' in Italian."</p>

<p>He gives it one last wet kiss then climbs up my torso, kisses the silver heart in my belly, up my sternum, until he's bracing himself on his elbows on either side of my head and smoothes my hair off my face. His blue eyes shine with need, his mouth open as he pants, and I've never felt so wanted, so needed by anyone in my life.</p>

<p>"Do you have any idea how amazing you are?" He rubs his nose against my own and licks the seam of my lips lightly.</p>

<p>My ragged breath catches. "Not half as amazing as you make me feel."</p>

<p>"Oh, my God, baby, I want you." I feel his impressive erection against me and I tilt my hips up in invitation.</p>

<p>"Yes." I nibble his lower lip.</p>

<p>He reaches down between us and gently rests a finger against my clitoris.</p>

<p>I arch up and gasp as I feel it all the way to my toes.</p>

<p>His mouth is hungrily on mine now, kissing me hard and deep, and suddenly I feel that fantastic finger slip lower to the lips of my opening and he growls against my lips.</p>

<p>"Fuck, you're so wet."</p>

<p>"I so want you."</p>

<p>He slips his finger in and out of me, and then he adds another, and I think I'm going to die from the sensations zinging around my body.</p>

<p>I grip his ass in my hands and tilt my pelvis up in invitation. "Now."</p>

<p>"Hold on."</p>

<p>What the fuck? Hold on?!</p>

<p>Suddenly he dives over the side of the bed to snag his shorts and pulls a foil packet out of his back pocket. I smile as he tears it open, his eyes locked on mine and he rolls it down his cock.</p>

<p>He leans over me again, poised at my entrance. I run my fingers up his spine to his gorgeous hair and lift my legs up, tilting my pelvis again. He rubs his nose over mine and slowly, oh so damned slowly, eases into me.</p>

<p>"Oh my," I breathe, as he closes his eyes tightly and leans his forehead against mine.</p>

<p>"Natalie," he whispers raggedly.</p>

<p>He pushes into me, all the way and stops. When I start to move my hips, his stops me, staring down at me again.</p>

<p>"Just wait."</p>

<p>I just want to move, I want him to pound in and out of me, to make me explode around him, and he looks so calm.</p>

<p>I squeeze my muscles around him, just once, and that's it.</p>

<p>"Fuck," he whispers and he starts to move in and out, gaining momentum. I'm meeting him with my hips and we establish a delicious rhythm. His lips are on mine again, his sliding and tangling with mine, and his hands are cupping my head, tangled in my hair.</p>

<p>I run my nails down his back and he pulls a hand down to my breast, then to my hip, and finally farther down to hook my knee around his arm, opening me wider, and I feel myself start to tighten, as all of the hair on my body stands up on end, and I bury my face in his neck.</p>

<p>"Yes, baby, let go."</p>

<p>And I do, convulsing around him.</p>

<p>"Oh, Luke!"</p>

<p>Suddenly I feel him stiffen and push into me twice more, and he empties himself into me.</p>

<p>"Natalie!"</p>


<hr/>

<p><span class="smallCaps">My breathing is starting</span> to calm and my vision clears, and I am cradling Luke against my chest. I run my fingers through his soft blonde hair, and gaze down at him as he catches his breath.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, I'm heavy. I'll move in about an hour." Luke doesn't move, but smiles.</p>

<p>I yank on his hair, then lean down and kiss his forehead.</p>

<p>"You're fine," I whisper and continue to pet his hair.</p>

<p>"Just fine?" He frowns playfully and pushes up off of me, breaking our precious connection. He discards of the condom, and lays down next to me, pulling me into his arms.</p>

<p>"Okay, you're better than fine."</p>

<p>"How are you?" he asks, serious now.</p>

<p>"I'm..." I search for the word. "Fantastic."</p>

<p>"Yes, you are." He kisses me lightly. "So, why the different languages?"</p>

<p>I shrug and look away, but he pulls my chin back toward him.</p>

<p>"I don't want anyone to know what they say unless I tell them."</p>

<p>"Who has been so lucky, Miss Conner?" He raises an eyebrow.</p>

<p>"You." I whisper.</p>

<p>"And?"</p>

<p>"You."</p>

<p>He gasps. "Really?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>He runs the backs of his fingers down my cheek, then his thumb across my bottom lip and I bite it.</p>

<p>"Oh, you want to get rough, do you?"</p>

<p>"Maybe later."</p>

<p>"What do you want to do, baby?" Oh, he's so sweet.</p>

<p>"I think I need a shower." I grin up at him and sit up, shimmy off the bed and turn back to him.</p>

<p>"I do love your ass, Nat."</p>

<p>I laugh, turn around and wiggle it for him, then saunter toward the bathroom.</p>

<p>"You'd better join me before I use all the hot water!"</p>
