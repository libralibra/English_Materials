<p class="storyTitle">Chapter Eighteen</p>

<p><i>I'm picking you up in an hour. Please dress formally.</i></p>

<p>Oh my. I stare at the text and read it again.</p>

<p>I glance at the clock. It's five thirty, and I'm definitely not anywhere near close to being formal or sexy. I don't even know where to start.</p>

<p>This is a job for Jules.</p>

<p>"Jules!" I yell out my bedroom door, mentally thumbing through my closet.</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"I need to get sexy."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>I shove my phone in her hands and she breaks out into a huge smile. "Wow, he knows how to woo a girl."</p>

<p>"Jules!" I clasp onto her shoulders and shake her. "Help me. I'm not good at this."</p>

<p>"Come on." She grabs my wrist and drags me into my closet. "The new red Louboutins are a no-brainer." She pulls them off the shelf and hands them to me.</p>

<p>"What am I going to wear with them?" I'm in a panic.</p>

<p>"Don't you have a little black dress?"</p>

<p>"No." I frown. I don't have many dresses at all.</p>

<p>"Everyone has a little black dress, Natalie."</p>

<p>"Not me." I shrug.</p>

<p>"Get in the shower and scrub, shave and loofa. I'll be back."</p>

<p>"That sounds painful." My eyes widen in fear and Jules smirks at me.</p>

<p>"We're just getting started. Go! Clock's ticking." She jogs back to her room and I start the shower.</p>

<hr/>

<p><span class="smallCaps">Fifty minutes later</span>, I am buffed and polished. Jules has curled my thick chestnut hair and managed to twist it up into some kind of sexy knot thing, with tendrils hanging around my face.</p>

<p>The face is a Julianne masterpiece. She's made my eyes look all smokey and sultry, accentuating the green in them. My cheekbones are defined, and my lips are pouty with a cranberry red lip stain that is guaranteed to not smudge or come off for eighteen hours, which sounds too good to be true to me, but I'll take it.</p>

<p>My eyes run down the rest of my body in the full-length mirror hanging on the back of my closet door.</p>

<p>I'm hot.</p>

<p>Jules has lent me a to-die-for black dress. The neckline reminds me of something Elizabeth Taylor would have worn, just off the shoulder with a deep V-neck. The back swoops down low across the small of my back. It's sleeveless and is gathered at the waist with a thick waistband. The skirt is floaty and soft, and flirts just at my knees.</p>

<p>Under the dress is some impressive black underwear and a garter belt with nude stockings. I've never worn stockings before, but they're amazingly comfortable and feel silky and sexy.</p>

<p>My beautiful red stiletto Louboutins are killer with this dress.</p>

<p>Jules walks into the room and lets out a loud wolf whistle.</p>

<p>"Well, don't you clean up well, best friend of mine?"</p>

<p>I laugh and do a turn so she can see the whole effect. "Will I do?"</p>

<p>"Girl, he's going to die of heart failure the minute he sees you. You look amazing." She smiles and hugs me tight.</p>

<p>"Here, this wrap and purse will go with your outfit." She hands me a beautiful red wrap and handbag that perfectly match the shoes and I smile in gratitude.</p>

<p>The doorbell rings and there are now about five million butterflies in my stomach.</p>

<p>"I'll answer. Take your time, make him sweat." She kisses my cheek and hurries down the stairs.</p>

<p>I stare at myself in the mirror for a few more minutes, and then put my things in Jules' red handbag.</p>

<p>Here goes nothing.</p>

<p>Do not fall down the stairs. Do not fall down the stairs.</p>

<p>This is my mantra as I walk down the stairs. I don't think I'm breathing, I'm too nervous. Where is he taking me?</p>

<p>I get to the bottom of the stairs and enter the foyer and all of my wits completely scatter.</p>

<p>Luke is wearing a black double breasted suit with a white shirt and a blue tie that perfectly matches his incredible eyes. His messy hair has been tamed somewhat, and it's begging for my fingers. He looks every bit the wealthy, sophisticated movie star, and he's all mine.</p>

<p>His eyes lock on mine and a slow, delighted grin spreads across his face.</p>

<p>"Natalie, you take my breath away."</p>

<p>"You're not so bad yourself."</p>

<p>Luke closes the gap between us and hands me a bouquet of red roses. "These are for you."</p>

<p>"Thank you," I murmur as I bury my nose in them and breathe them in. "They're lovely."</p>

<p>"We should go, we have reservations." He takes my hand and kisses my knuckles, shooting shivers up my arm.</p>

<p>"Okay."</p>

<p>Jules magically appears from nowhere. "I'll put those in water for you. Have fun, you guys. You both look incredible."</p>

<p>"Thanks, Jules." I hand her the flowers and Luke ushers me out of the house.</p>

<p>Instead of his Mercedes or the Lexus, there's a black stretch limo parked in my driveway with a sharply dressed driver standing at the open back door.</p>

<p>"Madam," he nods at me and I smile in return.</p>

<p>Holy shit, Luke's gone all out! Is this how he says he's sorry? If so, we might have to argue more often.</p>

<p>I climb in the back of the spacious limo and slide over so Luke can follow. The inside must seat ten easily, is all soft black leather seats and has some sort of impressive sound system and other gadgets. The privacy glass is up.</p>

<p>Luke slides gracefully next to me and kisses my hand again.</p>

<p>"Luke, this is...amazing. Thank you."</p>

<p>"We haven't even gone anywhere yet." He looks so young and happy, and he's clearly excited for what he has planned for us tonight.</p>

<p>"It's already more than you should have done."</p>

<p>"No, it's exactly what you deserve, baby." He leans over and gives me his sweet, tender kiss; the one that makes my insides quiver. "You look gorgeous tonight."</p>

<p>I smile and flush at the compliment. "Thank you."</p>

<p>"Are those the new shoes?"</p>

<p>"Yes," I grin.</p>

<p>"They are wow."</p>

<p>"I know."</p>

<p>He laughs and pours me a glass of champagne as the driver pulls away from the house and heads toward Seattle.</p>

<p>"A toast." He holds his glass in the air and I mirror him. "To a beautiful woman, who has become very special to me, and who is the most incredible person I've ever known. Thank you for being here with me." He clinks his glass to mine and I blink back tears as I take a sip of the sweet pink drink.</p>

<p>"You are charming," I murmur and smile shyly at him.</p>

<p>"You are sexy as hell."</p>

<p>"Where are we going?" I take another sip of the champagne. Mmm... delicious.</p>

<p>"It's a surprise."</p>

<p>"Will it take a while to get there?"</p>

<p>"A little while. Why do you ask?"</p>

<p>I take his drink out of his hand and place it next to mine on a small table near the mini-fridge.</p>

<p>"Because," I hike my skirt up a bit and straddle his lap. His eyes widen in surprise and his strong hands glide up my stocking clad legs. "I want to fuck you in this limousine."</p>

<p>"Holy shit, baby, you're wearing stockings."</p>

<p>I smile smugly and nod.</p>

<p>"I had a whole seduction scene planned for later." His breath hitches as I grind my center against his growing erection.</p>

<p>"Trust me, I don't want to ruin your plans." I lean forward and brush my lips over his. "But if you're not inside me in about twenty seconds, I'm not responsible for my actions."</p>

<p>"That's an offer I will never, ever refuse baby." He slides me back on his knees so he can unfasten his pants, pulling his shirt tails out of them and pushing them down around his thighs.</p>

<p>Instead of straddling him, I slip off his lap and onto my knees on the luxuriously carpeted floor. I smooth my hands up his strong thighs and stroke them up and down his cock.</p>

<p>"Holy shit, Nat, you are so fucking hot."</p>

<p>"You make me crazy." I smear the bead of moisture around the tip with my thumb and then put it in my mouth and suck and his eyes go wide.</p>

<p>"Taste good?"</p>

<p>"Mmmm...my favorite."</p>

<p>I take him in my mouth, just swirling my tongue around the tip and gliding my hands up and down his impressive length. I feel his fingertips just barely grazing my hairline around my ears and I know he wants to sink his fingers in my hair, but doesn't want to mess it up.</p>

<p>I grip his shaft with my lips firmly and sink down until I feel him against the back of my throat.</p>

<p>"Sweet Jesus, Natalie, stop."</p>

<p>I grin to myself and pull back but then sink down again, loving that I'm making him crazy.</p>

<p>"No, stop, I don't want to come in your mouth." He reaches down and lifts me onto his lap so I'm straddling him again. He reaches between us and pulls my panties to the side and I rub my folds against him, feeling my wetness spreading over him.</p>

<p>"God, baby, you're so wet."</p>

<p>"You are so sexy, honey. I need you inside me."</p>

<p>He growls and kisses me hard while lifting my ass over him and sinks easily inside me. I grip the back of the seat behind his head and begin riding him, slowly at first, but his hands move me up and down faster and faster.</p>

<p>"Come for me, beautiful." He's kissing my neck and moves one hand between us to graze his thumb over my clitoris and I'm lost. I shudder and clench down around him, crying out as he pushes up one last, hard time and empties himself into me.</p>

<p>"Fuck, Natalie." His breathing is ragged. I wrap my fingers in his hair and kiss him with all I have, pouring my heart and soul into the kiss, trying to convey the words that I just can't say: that I love him so much.</p>

<p>He tenderly cups my face in his hands and slows the kiss, pulling back so he can look into my eyes, and I see the love reflected back to me. It makes me glow inside, and it makes me want to run as fast as I can in the other direction.</p>

<p>"Thank you for tonight," I whisper.</p>

<p>"Oh, baby, it's just getting started." He gives me a slow, sweet smile and lifts me off of him. I rummage around and find a towel, and we clean up and straighten our clothes.</p>

<p>Settling back into our seats, Luke freshens our champagne and wraps his arm around me.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry about today," he murmurs.</p>

<p>"Me too," I sigh and lean my head on his shoulder. "Did you get your work done?"</p>

<p>"For the most part. I'll have to make a few calls tomorrow."</p>

<p>"Oh good." He's running his fingertips up and down my bare arm and I want to purr.</p>

<p>"What did you do today?"</p>

<p>"I hung out with Jules." I take his hand in mine and lace my fingers through his, reveling in how long and lean his hands are. "She's got some stuff going on, so I did the best friend thing."</p>

<p>"Is she okay?" He sounds sincerely concerned and I can't help but grin. <i>My sweet man.</i></p>

<p>"She will be. Man troubles."</p>

<p>"Ah. So, what does the best friend thing entail, exactly?" He kisses my forehead.</p>

<p>"Well, a lot of talking, eating ice cream and other things that I'm not allowed to divulge."</p>

<p>"Oh?" He chuckles and kisses my forehead again.</p>

<p>"Yeah, I could tell you, but then I'd have to kill you, and I've grown quite fond of you."</p>

<p>"Is that so?" He leans back so he can look me in the eye and I nod gravely.</p>

<p>"Yes, very fond of you."</p>

<p>"And what are you most fond of, exactly?" He gives me his sweet smile, and I know that despite our teasing he wants an honest answer.</p>

<p>"I'm fond of this." I lean up and kiss his lips softly. "You say such sweet things to me, and make my body hum with it."</p>

<p>"Happy to hear that, beautiful girl."</p>

<p>I smile and kiss the palm of his hand. "And I enjoy your hands, and how expressive they are and how they feel when they're on me."</p>

<p>"Mmm...they love being on you, baby."</p>

<p>I lay my cheek on his chest, just over his heart. "Most of all, I love your heart; how kind you are and how gentle you are with me. Most of the time." I add and smile up at him.</p>

<p>His lips part as he exhales. "Natalie, I don't know what I did to deserve you, but I would do it again, over and over." He runs his knuckles down my cheek and kisses me tenderly as the limo comes to a stop.</p>

<p>"We're here."</p>

<p>Luke climbs out ahead of me and takes my hand to help me out of the impressive car. He pulls me to his side, and my eyes are glued to the enormous Chateau before us.</p>

<p>"Oh, my."</p>

<p>"This is Chateau <i>Ste.</i> Michelle. We're going to have dinner here tonight."</p>

<p>"I didn't know they had a restaurant." My wide eyes meet his.</p>

<p>"They don't. They do special events. Tonight, for a few hours at least, it's all ours."</p>

<p>I'm struck dumb. He rented out the entire Chateau for me?</p>

<p>"Come." He leads me toward the front of the building where an older woman, in her mid-fifties, is waiting for us.</p>

<p>"Welcome, Mr. Williams and Ms. Conner. I'm Mrs. Davidson. We're delighted to have you. Would you please follow me?" She leads us on a cobblestone path around the side of the Chateau. It's lined with old fashioned street lights, illuminating the whole side of the building.</p>

<p>Luke tucks my hand in his arm and escorts me along behind Mrs. Davidson. As we round the bend behind the house I gasp at the sight before me.</p>

<p>"Oh, Luke." I feel him grin down at me, watching my reaction to the most beautiful display I've ever seen. The stone path leads us beneath an arbor that is covered in grape vines. The vines are heavy with luscious, purple grapes. There are white twinkling Christmas lights draped over roughly ten two-person tables, and wound through the arbor and vines lining the small space. There is soft bluesy music crooning in the back ground.</p>

<p>The small table in the center of the stone patio is covered in a white table cloth. The china is also white, but on one plate sits a single red rose. Luke walks forward and pulls the chair out for me and I sit.</p>

<p>He picks up the rose and I look up into his joy-filled eyes. He sniffs the delicate flower before extending it to me.</p>

<p>"For you, beautiful."</p>

<p>"Thank you." I put the bloom against my nose and sniff its sweetness.</p>

<p>Luke sits opposite me at the table.</p>

<p>"Honey, this is wonderful. Thank you." I reach over and grasp his hand in mine, so moved by this devastatingly romantic gesture.</p>

<p>"I'm glad you like it." He grins and gestures to the waiter.</p>

<p>"Sir, madam," The waiter is dressed in a white jacket and black pants and bow-tie. He's an older gentleman with white hair and a British accent and I can't help but fall just a little in love with him.</p>

<p>"Thank you for joining us this evening. We will be serving you three courses, in addition to an appetizer course and, of course, dessert. I hope you're hungry." He winks at me and motions to someone inside the building.</p>

<p>"Here is your appetizer; chili garlic calamari paired with our 2009 dry Riesling, and Hawaiian style chicken skewers paired with the 2008 Cabinet Riesling."</p>

<p>The plates are set in front of us with glasses of wine.</p>

<p>I meet Luke's eyes over the table. "It looks too pretty to eat."</p>

<p>"Enjoy, baby."</p>

<p>We dig in and enjoy the appetizers. The wines complement each dish perfectly, flooding my mouth with amazing flavors and textures.</p>

<p>Luke reaches over and holds my hand, rubbing his thumb over my knuckles as we finish our wine and wait for the next course.</p>

<p>"Are you having fun?"</p>

<p>"Much more than fun. This is...a fairy tale." I feel my cheeks heat, but it's the truth.</p>

<p>"This is a beautiful vineyard. We'll have to come again during the day so you can see the grounds."</p>

<p>"I'd love that."</p>

<p>"May I present your first course?" Our waiter is back and removes our empty plates and wine glasses. "This is our mojito marinated halibut with mango, avocado and black bean salsa, served with the 2009 Midsummer's White. Enjoy." He backs away, leaving us with the delicious meal.</p>

<p>We're served two more courses of pork tenderloin and New York steak with Yukon gold potatoes, and, of course, the perfect wines to accompany them.</p>

<p>I'm feeling very full and just a little light headed from all the wine when it's time for dessert to be served.</p>

<p>"Oh my God, Luke, I don't know if there is any room left in this dress for dessert." I sit back and rub my belly and Luke laughs, his eyes light with happiness. He's having a really good time, and has been light hearted and complimentary throughout our meal. He's so good at this.</p>

<p>He motions to the waiter who immediately steps to the tableside. "Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"I think that Ms. Conner and I will share the dessert, please."</p>

<p>"Very good, sir."</p>

<p>"Good plan. Besides, we're going to work all these calories off at yoga tomorrow morning."</p>

<p>"Ah yes, yoga. You're going to make me go, huh?"</p>

<p>"No, I'm not making you."</p>

<p>"We could skip it and stay in bed all day." He winks at me over his wine glass.</p>

<p>"I can't skip it, I'm the instructor."</p>

<p>"I had no idea." He furrows his brow in confusion.</p>

<p>"I only teach three classes a week." I shrug. "Besides, I'm very flexible. You should enjoy the show." I smile smugly into my glass and watch his eyes glass over.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't miss it for the world."</p>

<p>The waiter reappears with our dessert of strawberry Crème Brulee tart, on one plate, and two glasses of the Eroica Ice Wine.</p>

<p>He also sets a baby blue Tiffany necklace sized box in the center of the table, bows to both of us, and walks away.</p>

<p>Oh. My. God.</p>
