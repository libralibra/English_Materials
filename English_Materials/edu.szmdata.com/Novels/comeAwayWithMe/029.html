<p class="storyTitle">Chapter Twenty-Eight</p>

<p>Tonight is Luke's parent's party, and I couldn't be more excited. I'm putting the finishing touches on my makeup&#151;I'm getting pretty good at this!&#151;while Luke is dressing in my bedroom. Jules keeps coming in and out of the room to borrow something, nag me about something, or just chatter because she is also nervous.</p>

<p>I love her.</p>

<p>I hear Luke laugh and I walk out into the bedroom. He's on the phone and at the sight of me his eyes darken and get glassy and I give a satisfied nod.</p>

<p>Mission accomplished.</p>

<p>I'm wearing a black dress that hangs off one shoulder. There are rhinestones along the high waist and it falls to my red Louboutin-clad feet. I'm wearing my hair up, thanks to Jules' handiwork, and my pearls.</p>

<p>I feel sophisticated and sexy.</p>

<p>"Okay, Dad, I have to go. We'll see you at the club. Just tell her you're taking her out for dinner. Okay, bye." He hangs up and crosses to me.</p>

<p>He's so handsome in his black suit and white shirt with black tie. His blonde hair is in some sort of order, but I'm sure I'll make a mess of it before long.</p>

<p>He rakes his gaze over my dress and hair and runs his fingertip under my pearls against my skin. "You are the most beautiful woman I've ever seen." He kisses me, in that way that makes me swoon, and I run my hands down his smooth cheeks.</p>

<p>"Thank you. You clean up pretty well yourself, handsome. Are you going to be okay tonight with all the people there?"</p>

<p>"Yeah, I'll be okay. I'm an actor, remember? I can play the part for one night."</p>

<p>"I don't want you to be uncomfortable." He doesn't fool me. I can see the nervousness in his eyes and the way he keeps fidgeting with his tie.</p>

<p>"I'll know most everyone there. My parents wouldn't invite a bunch of strangers, so it should be cool." He kisses my forehead and his lips turn up on one side. "Are you worried about me?"</p>

<p>"Of course I am. I love you."</p>

<p>His eyes soften. "I love you too."</p>

<p>"Hey, Nat, can I borrow...Oh, God. We don't have time for this." Jules shakes her head in disgust and stomps into my closet, coming out wearing a pair of my earrings. "Can I borrow these earrings?"</p>

<p>"Yes," I laugh. "That dress is to die for."</p>

<p>"I know, right?" She flashes a Cheshire cat grin and turns in a slow circle showing off her strapless red dress. She's stunning in red.</p>

<p>"Are you bringing Nate tonight?" I ask.</p>

<p>"No way, not introducing him to family." Jules shakes her head adamantly and I let it go. She's still not talking much about Nate.</p>

<p>"Okay." I shrug and smile. "Want to ride with us?"</p>

<p>"No, Isaac and Stacy are picking me up. I'll see you there."</p>

<p>"Ready, baby?" Luke asks me.</p>

<p>"Let's go."</p>

<hr/>

<p><span class="smallCaps">The anniversary party</span> is being held at a country club in Bellevue that Luke's family belongs to. The ballroom has been decorated beautifully, with colorful flower centerpieces, twinkling lights and candles. There is a two-person wooden bench sitting near the entrance with black markers for everyone to sign in lieu of a guestbook. Neil will place it by Lucy's favorite flower garden at home.</p>

<p>"Luke, this is gorgeous. Samantha and your father did a great job. Your mom is going to be beside herself."</p>

<p>Luke smiles widely, "She'll love it. Come on, let me introduce you to some people."</p>

<p>He snatches two glasses of champagne from a waiter and hands one to me as we begin mingling about the room. I am excited to see Gail and Steven have already arrived and I hug them both.</p>

<p>"Oh my goodness, you both look so wonderful!" Gail is simply stunning with her short blond hair styled around her face, and she's wearing a beautiful royal blue evening gown. Steven is dapper as can be in a black suit and tie. I couldn't be more proud of them.</p>

<p>"Darling, you are breathtaking." Gail hugs me close, her eyes shining with love and happiness.</p>

<p>"Thank you for coming, both of you. My parents will be delighted to see you." Luke shakes Steven's hand and kisses Gail on the cheek.</p>

<p>"Thank you for inviting us. You look so handsome, dear."</p>

<p>"Happy to be here," Steven responds and winks at Luke.</p>

<p>Huh? I look up at Luke, wondering what that wink was about, but Luke's face gives nothing away.</p>

<p>The room is filling quickly with people, and Luke sticks close to my side, his hand on my back, introducing me to his family and friends.</p>

<p>Finally, in a moment alone, he hands me a fresh glass of champagne and whispers in my ear, "You are unbelievably gorgeous tonight. And you are charming everyone in this room."</p>

<p>His smile is possessive and loving and I warm at his words.</p>

<p>"You're the charming one. Are you having fun?"</p>

<p>"Yeah, I'm excited to see my mom's reaction. In fact"&#151;he looks at his watch&#151;"time to get everyone seated."</p>

<p>He has a word with the band leader who then announces, "Ladies and gentlemen, please find your seats. The guests of honor will be arriving shortly."</p>

<p>Luke and I are seated at the head table with his parents, Samantha and her date and Luke's brother, Mark.</p>

<p>"Luke, Natalie, this is my date, Paul."</p>

<p>Luke shakes his hand while giving him a speculative stare, and I smile to myself.</p>

<p>Overprotective brother.</p>

<p>"Hey, beautiful." Mark flashes me that signature Williams grin and pulls me into a hug. "Good to see you're still putting up with my brother's shit. When you've had enough of him, give me a call." He winks down at me and I can't help but laugh.</p>

<p>"Stop fondling my girlfriend. Find your own." Luke pulls me out of Mark's grasp as Mark grins at him.</p>

<p>Yes, these Williams men are charmers.</p>

<p>Luke takes my hand and kisses my fingers as he guides me to my seat between him and Mark.</p>

<p>Suddenly the ballroom doors swing open, and the room erupts into applause. Neil is smiling lovingly down at his bride as Lucy's mouth drops and she looks around the large room, realizing that she recognizes everyone here.</p>

<p>She turns to Neil with a shocked smile and he dips her way down low and kisses her tenderly. I can't hear what he says to her, but I'm quite sure he says, "Happy anniversary, my love."</p>

<p>I can't stop smiling.</p>

<p>Lucy is wearing a beautiful black evening dress and Neil is in a black suit and red tie. They look young and happy and still very much in love.</p>

<p>As they make their way through the crowd to our table, they stop to shake hands and give hugs to other guests.</p>

<p>I turn to Luke and grin up at him. "They look so happy. I'm so happy for them."</p>

<p>"Me too." He kisses my forehead, and I decide to be the bigger person here, to try to make things right with his sister.</p>

<p>"Samantha." I lean around Luke toward his sister to get her attention. "This is a great party. You did a fantastic job."</p>

<p>She looks stunned for a moment, then plasters the fake smile on her face, and my heart sinks. No smoothing things over tonight. "Thanks, Natalie."</p>

<p>I look up at Luke and shrug. He shakes his head ruefully and we turn our attention back to his parents.</p>

<p>Lucy hugs me tightly on her way to her seat. "Oh, Natalie, this is amazing!"</p>

<p>"I'm so happy that you're surprised and happy, Lucy. Happy anniversary."</p>

<p>"Thank you." She kisses my cheek and then enfolds Luke into a hug.</p>

<p>"Hello, dear." Neil sweeps me up in a hug, all smiles. "Were you able to finish the project you were working on?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and I'll have it with me tomorrow at brunch." We are hosting brunch at Luke's house tomorrow morning to give his parents their gifts and have a private family celebration.</p>

<p>"Perfect. Thank you." He smiles at me kindly, and moves on around the table.</p>

<p>"My parents love you," Luke murmurs in my ear.</p>

<p>"It's mutual."</p>

<p>We take our seats and Neil stands, tapping his water glass with his spoon and the room hushes. Someone hands him a microphone.</p>

<p>"I want to thank you all for coming tonight, and extend a special thank you to my lovely daughter, Samantha, for being my partner in crime these past few months. It's been daunting keeping this little secret from my beautiful bride." He smiles down at her and she blushes prettily. "I am a very lucky man. As of tomorrow, I have had the honor of spending every day with the best person I've ever known for thirty five years. Luce, you are my best friend, the love of my life, and I would do it again every single day. Thank you for putting up with my shenanigans, for our three gorgeous children, and for teaching me how to cook a steak."</p>

<p>As we all laugh, Lucy wipes a tear from the corner of her eye and grins at her husband.</p>

<p>"Happy anniversary, my love. Here's to thirty five more." Lucy stands amongst the applause and Neil kisses her soundly.</p>

<p>The band starts to play a bluesy tune and a delicious dinner is served.</p>

<p>"So, Natalie, how was Tahiti?" Lucy smiles warmly across the table at me.</p>

<p>"Warm, romantic, and completely perfect." I respond with a wink. "I didn't want to come home."</p>

<p>Luke kisses my fingers. "We'll go back."</p>

<p>The band begins to play <i>At last</i> by Etta James, and Neil stands. "I believe this is our song, beautiful."</p>

<p>He takes her hand and we all watch as he moves her effortlessly across the dance floor. They are gazing at each other as though they're the only two in the room.</p>

<p>"Your parents are so in love," I murmur to Luke.</p>

<p>"Yeah, it gets a bit gross for a kid to watch." He shakes his head, but his eyes are full of humor. "Shall we join them?"</p>

<p>"Sure."</p>

<p>As he leads me out to the dance floor, I see other couples, including Jules' parents; get up to dance to the sweet song. Luke pulls me into his arms and we glide around the floor.</p>

<p>"I love dancing with you." I run my fingers down his cheek and his blue eyes light up.</p>

<p>"We should do it more often then."</p>

<p>"Yes, we should." I smile up at him and his eyes are suddenly so serious. What's wrong? Is he still nervous about the crowd?</p>

<p>"Nat, I..."</p>

<p>Jules sweeps by on the arm of one of Luke's cousins. "Definitely glad I came stag," she mumbles to me as she passes, smiles and shrugs, then gives us a finger wave, clearly enjoying her night.</p>

<p>"You were saying?" I ask Luke.</p>

<p>He exhales and pulls me tightly against him, nuzzles my ear with his nose, and whispers, "I love you."</p>

<p>The evening moves quickly, and magically. Luke keeps me tucked close to his side all night, glaring at anyone who dares ask me to dance, and I can't help but laugh at my possessive man.</p>

<p>No one asks for an autograph, and Luke poses politely for the photographer Samantha hired for the occasion, knowing the photos will be the property of the family.</p>

<p>"There you are!" I turn at Stacy's excited voice and hug her tightly.</p>

<p>"Well, hello pretty girl! I told you when we bought it, that dress is a knockout." I stand back and admire her beautiful white off the shoulder dress. It fits her body perfectly and she glows with happiness.</p>

<p>"Thank you. Yours is stunning too."</p>

<p>Isaac pulls me into a hug. "Hey, brat. Thanks for helping Stacy find that dress. It's torture. I have two more weeks before I can touch her and I think I'm going to die."</p>

<p>We all laugh at his pained expression and I pat his cheek. "Poor boy. I think Sophie's worth it."</p>

<p>"Yeah," his face transforms into a sweet smile. "She is. Hey, dance with me?"</p>

<p>I look up at Luke and he shrugs and turns to Stacy. "Do me the honor, beautiful?"</p>

<p>Stacy blushes bright red and takes his hand as he leads her onto the floor. I know how she feels, he's a heart throb.</p>

<p>Isaac isn't too bad himself. He's tall and toned and tan, with dark blond hair and killer brown eyes. I had a crush on him for years.</p>

<p>"Are you having fun?" I ask him.</p>

<p>"Yeah, Stacy is especially, so I can't complain. Luke's a good guy. I wasn't so sure about him at first, but I like him."</p>

<p>"What brought that on?"</p>

<p>"Dad and I had a conversation with him the other day."</p>

<p>"What?" Why didn't I know about this?</p>

<p>"Yeah, you were working, and he invited all of us guys out for lunch." He shrugs and smiles like he's hiding something. I know Isaac. The man is like Fort Knox. If there's a secret, he won't spill it.</p>

<p>"Oh. He didn't mention it."</p>

<p>"Didn't he?" he shrugs again, like it's no big deal. "Well, my point is, I like him."</p>

<p>"Wow, am I getting the big brother stamp of approval?" I widen my eyes and drop my jaw sarcastically.</p>

<p>"As long as he minds his manners, yes."</p>

<p>"I like it when he doesn't mind his manners." I wink at him and laugh as he cringes.</p>

<p>"TMI. Jesus, I don't want to know that. Are you happy?" He peers down at me, serious now, and I can't help but feel loved.</p>

<p>"I am. He's a good man, Isaac. He loves me. It's not about what he does for a living, or what I've done in my past, or how much money either of us has. It's about who I am when I'm with him." I shrug, a bit embarrassed. "He makes me feel special."</p>

<p>"Ah, Nat. You are special, honey, I'm just glad you finally figured it out. It's a pleasure watching you fall in love." We winks down at me. "Now, before I get too mushy, can you babysit one of these nights? I need some serious alone time with my wife."</p>

<p>I laugh. "Sure, shall we say in two weeks?"</p>

<p>"Oh, God, yes. Thank you."</p>

<hr/>

<p><span class="smallCaps">As the evening draws</span> to a close, Luke pulls me out on the dance floor for one final dance. My feet are killing me, but I can't refuse him. I love swaying in his arms.</p>

<p>I realize that the band is playing Norah Jones' <i>Come Away With Me</i> and I turn my startled gaze up to his. He's smiling down at me tenderly.</p>

<p>"I do believe this is our song. You look as beautiful tonight as you did that night, in the vineyard, in these pearls. You take my breath away, Natalie Grace Conner."</p>

<p>Oh.</p>

<p>I feel the tears in my eyes, as I gaze up at him. I run my fingers through his soft blonde hair. "You sure know how to sweep a girl off her feet, Luke Edward Williams."</p>

<p>His eyes skim over my face as he moves me about the room. I swear, we're the only two here and I don't care who's watching us.</p>

<p>He leans down and gently presses his cheek to mine. "Thank you," he whispers.</p>

<p>"For what?" I whisper back.</p>

<p>"For being mine."</p>

<hr/>

<p><span class="smallCaps">When we reach Luke's house</span> he leads me inside and shuts the front door. He tugs my hand gently, pulling me into his arms.</p>

<p>"You were wonderful tonight. You charmed everyone," he murmurs in my hair.</p>

<p>"I had a great time. Your family is wonderful." I nuzzle his chest and inhale his sexy Luke scent.</p>

<p>"Are you sure you're okay with us having the family here in the morning for brunch?"</p>

<p>"Of course. I'll even help you cook."</p>

<p>He chuckles. "Thank you for your service."</p>

<p>"It's a good cause. Let's go to bed." I pull away but he stops me, his eyes suddenly serious.</p>

<p>"Not yet."</p>

<p>"Are you okay?"</p>

<p>"I'm more than okay. I have something to show you."</p>

<p>"Oh, okay."</p>

<p>He takes my hand in his and leads me through the room. He stops by the sound system and fires up his iPod and something bluesy and slow starts to pour out of the speakers. He leads us to the deck, opens the French door, and flips a switch and I gasp.</p>

<p>The deck has been transformed into soft and romantic. Bouquets of red roses with tiny white pearls tucked in the petals cover every surface. There are twinkling white lights strung back and forth, high along the ceiling of the space, and a small table is sitting by the loveseat with a bucket of ice and champagne and two glasses.</p>

<p>I twirl and gaze up at him, my eyes wide. "When did you do this?"</p>

<p>"I had it done earlier while we were getting ready for the party at your house."</p>

<p>"Luke, it's magical." I turn to take in the beautiful space, breathless. He's so romantic.</p>

<p>He wraps his arms around me from behind and buries his face in my neck. "Do you like it?"</p>

<p>"I love it. Thank you."</p>

<p>"Come, sit." He leads me to the loveseat and we sit. My dress floats around my legs as I sit, and it feels soft against my skin. I smile to myself, remembering that I'm not wearing any underwear. Luke will enjoy that when he finds out.</p>

<p>He pours us each a glass of champagne, clinks his glass to mine and I take a sip.</p>

<p>"It's nice tonight. It's not even very cold." I lean my head back against the cushion and close my eyes, listening to the water that we can't see in the darkness. Luke lifts my feet into his lap and I turn my head so I can watch him.</p>

<p>He removes my shoes and starts to rub.</p>

<p>"Oh, sweet mother of God, I love you."</p>

<p>He laughs. "Feet hurt?"</p>

<p>"A little. Those shoes are worth it."</p>

<p>"Yes, they are. Did I mention that you look beautiful tonight?"</p>

<p>"Once or twice." I wink at him and sigh as his thumb pushes down the arch of my foot. "You're good with your hands."</p>

<p>"I'm glad you approve."</p>

<p>"I could get used to this, you know. All these flowers and foot rubs and champagne and you, my handsome boyfriend."</p>

<p>He frowns and my heart stills for just a moment. What did I say wrong?</p>

<p>"Hey," I pull my feet out of his lap and move toward him, lying across his lap. He wraps his arms around me, holding me to his chest, and I cup his face in my hand. "What is it?"</p>

<p>His eyes are on mine, intensely blue and serious, and I know that something important is on his mind.</p>

<p>"Talk to me, baby." I continue to caress his face, and he turns his head to press a kiss in my palm.</p>

<p>"I don't think I want to be your boyfriend anymore."</p>

<p>What?</p>

<p>I still and narrow my eyes at him. "Okay, I'll get my things." I move to get up but he tightens his hold on me, clenching his jaw and his eyes closed tightly.</p>

<p>"No, that's not what I mean. I'm not breaking up with you."</p>

<p>"What are you doing?" I whisper.</p>

<p>"I'm fucking this up." He opens his eyes and I see fear, and longing, and love.</p>

<p>What's this?</p>

<p>"I've wanted to do this all night, but I couldn't find the right time, and I'm glad I didn't because it should be here, while we're alone." He swallows and takes a deep breath. "Natalie, since I've known you, my world has changed. I found something with you that I didn't know I was missing, but that I wanted very much. You are such a beautiful woman, inside and out. You beguile me. I can't keep my hands off of you. You are so sexy and fun and smart. Your sassy mouth makes me crazy." He smiles down at me and runs his fingertip along my lower lip.</p>

<p>I'm speechless, which is good because he doesn't seem to be finished.</p>

<p>"I can't ever imagine my life without you. You are the center of my world, Nat. I want to love you, protect you, fight with you, make babies with you and spoil the shit out of you for the rest of my life."</p>

<p>He takes a deep breath and pulls a small Tiffany-blue box out of his pants pocket. I feel my eyes go wide, my heart rate spikes and my breath catches.</p>

<p>My eyes search his as he holds the tiny box in his beautiful hand.</p>

<p>"Natalie, be my wife. Marry me."</p>
