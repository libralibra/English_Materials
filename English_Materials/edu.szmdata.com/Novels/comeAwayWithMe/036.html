 <p class="storyTitle">Acknowledgements</p>

<p>First, to my husband: thank you for loving me, challenging me, and sticking with me, even when I have my face buried in my computer, lost in my own world. I love you, handsome.</p>

<p>Mom and Dad: thank you for being MY mom and dad, for encouraging me to read and use my imagination and to believe that I am capable of anything I set my mind to. You are two of the most loving, kind, intelligent people I know, and I love you.</p>

<p>Mike: the torment you put me through as a child is now paying off in humorous anecdotes in my books. So...thank you for being a typical little brother. And thank you for being one of my best friends. I'm so proud of you, Mikey.</p>

<p>Tanya Robo: you are not just the best beta reader in the world. You have been my best friend, cheerleader, and confidante for the better part of thirty years (shh). When it comes to my writing, there is no one in my life that encourages me the way you do. Thank you for always believing in my talent, and for just being such a beautiful part of my life. I don't know what I would do without you.</p>

<p>To Nichole Boyovich, Kara Erickson, Eke Leo, Courtney McDaniel, Holly Pierce and Samantha Baer : you ladies freaking ROCK! Thank you for reading Come Away With Me, giving me your feedback, and falling in love with the Luke and Natalie. You are the best beta readers a girl could ask for!</p>

<p>Lori Francis: Girl, you are quite simply amazing. I can't believe how welcoming and genuinely kind you have been to this new author, offering so much advice and help that it's overwhelming.</p>

<p>I'm blessed to have found you! Thank you, so very much, for falling in love with Come Away With Me and having the fire in your belly to champion this book. I am not only thankful for all your hard work and enthusiasm, but for your friendship too.</p>

<p>Sali Powers and Jenny Aspinall: Do you know how crazy it is to me that you gorgeous women, who live all the way over in Australia, have not only read the book and given me so much support and help with it, but have also become my very dear friends? Thank you, for all the help, time and encouragement you've given me. I so appreciate you!</p>

<p>Renae Porter: you are the very best cover artist EVER!! Oh my goodness, I love my cover. Thank you for working with me.</p>

<p>To the bloggers and authors who have been such a great source of support, encouragement and knowledge: thank you! You know who you are.</p>

<p>And last, but certainly never least, to YOU. The person holding this book.</p>

<p>Thank you for reading Luke and Natalie's love story. I hope you loved it.</p>

<p>Happy Reading!</p>
