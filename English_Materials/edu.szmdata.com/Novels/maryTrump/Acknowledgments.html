<p class="storyTitle">Acknowledgments</p>

<p>At Simon and Schuster, thanks to Jon Karp, Eamon Dolan, Jessica Chin, Paul Dippolito, Lynn Anderson, and Jackie Seow.</p>

<p>At WME thanks to Jay Mandel and Sian-Ashleigh Edwards.</p>

<p>Thank you also to Carolyn Levin for your thoughtful vetting; David Corn at <i>Mother Jones</i> for your kindness; Darren Ankrom, fact-checker extraordinaire; Stuart Oltchick for telling me about better days; Captain Jerry Lawler for all of the wonderful TWA history; and Maryanne Trump Barry for all of the enlightening information.</p>

<p>My appreciation to Denise Kemp for the solidarity with me; to my mother, Linda Trump, for all of the great stories; Laura Schweers; Debbie R; Stefanie B; and Jennifer T for your friendship and trust when I most needed them. Jill and Mark Nass for helping us keep the tradition alive (JCE!).</p>

<p>To our beloved Trumpy, whom I miss every day.</p>

<p>I am deeply grateful to Ted Boutrous, for that first meeting and for believing in the cause; Annie Champion for your generosity and friendship; Pat Roth for your thoughtful feedback and for being in my life; Annamaria Forcier for being such a good friend to my dad, I am so glad I found you; Susanne Craig and Russ Buettner for their extraordinary journalism and integrity, thank you for bringing me along for the ride. Sue, none of this would have been possible without your persistence, courage, and encouragement; Liz Stein for being on the journey with me and making this a better bookâ€”and this a much more fun, less lonely experience than it might have been (and, of course, for Baby Yoda); Eric Adler for being there for me throughout, for your tireless feedback, and for having my back at the local pawnbroker; and Alice Frankston for being involved from the very beginning of this project, believing in it even when I didn't, and reading every word more times than I can count. I can't wait for what comes next.</p>

<p>And finally, to my daughter, Avary, for being more patient and understanding than any kid should have to be. I love you.</p>
