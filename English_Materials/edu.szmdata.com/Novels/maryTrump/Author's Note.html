<p class="c"><i>For my daughter, Avary and my dad</i></p>

<hr class="style14"/>

<p>If the soul is left in darkness, sins will be committed. The guilty one is not he who commits the sin, but the one who causes the darkness.</p>

<p class="storyAuthor">—Victor Hugo, <i>Les Miserables</i></p>
<hr class="style14"/>

<p class="storyTitle">Author's Note</p>

<p>Much of this book comes from my own memory. For events during which I was not present, I relied on conversations and interviews, many of which are recorded, with members of my family, family friends, neighbors, and associates. I've reconstructed some dialogue according to what I personally remember and what others have told me. Where dialogue appears, my intention was to re-create the essence of conversations rather than provide verbatim quotes. I have also relied on legal documents, bank statements, tax returns, private journals, family documents, correspondence, emails, texts, photographs, and other records.</p>

<p>For general background, I relied on the <i>New York Times, </i>in particular the investigative article by David Barstow, Susanne Craig, and Russ Buettner that was published on October 2, 2018; the <i>Washington Post; Vanity Fair; Politico; </i>the TWA Museum website; and Norman Vincent Peale's <i>The Power of Positive Thinking.</i> For background on Steeplechase Park, I thank the Coney Island History Project website, <i>Brooklyn Paper,</i> and a May 14, 2018, article on 6sqft.com by Dana Schulz. For his insights into "the episodic man," thank you to Dan P. McAdams. For family history and information regarding Trump family businesses and alleged crimes, I am grateful for the reporting of the late Wayne Barrett, David Corn, Michael D'Antonio, David Cay Johnston, Tim O'Brien, Charles P. Pierce, and Adam Serwer. Thanks also to Gwenda Blair, and Michael Kranish and Marc Fisher—but my dad was forty-two, not forty-three, when he died.</p>
