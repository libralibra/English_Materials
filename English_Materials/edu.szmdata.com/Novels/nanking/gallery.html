<p class="imgDescriptions">An example of Japanese propaganda. The Japanese pasied this image all over Nanking--a poster displaying a kindly Japanese soldier holding a Chinese baby while giving food to his grateful parents. The posters urged the citizens, "Return to your homes! We will give you rice to eat! Trust and rely on the Japanese army, you can get help!" Many of these posters were found near homes in which atrocities had occurred. Japanese army planes also dropped leaflets promising, "All good Chinese who return to their homes will be fed and clothed. Japan wants to be a good neighbor to those Chinese not fooled by monsters who are Chiang Kai-shek's soldiers." After such drops, thousands of Nanking citizens left the Safety Zone to return to their homes (John Rabe Collection, Yale Divinity School Library).</p>

<p class="imgDescriptions">The original caption reads: "This picture shows Japanese recruits at bayonet drill in Nanking after the capture of the Chinese capital. They are using Chinese prisoners for their targets. In the center an unfortunate prisoner (or should we say fortunate) has just received the death thrust. In foreground, a bound Chinese is being 'lightly' pricked with the bayonet in order to get him into position for the coup de grâce. As to the authenticity of the photo--it was sent to <i>Look</i> by W. A. Farmer of Hankow, who says the photograph was made by a Japanese soldier. The film was sent to Shanghai to be developed. Chinese employees in the Japanese-owned shop made extra prints and smuggled them out" (UPI/Bettmann).</p>
