		<p class="zeroIndentMarginTop">I'm deeply grateful to John and Ann Doerr, Laurene Powell, Mona Simpson, and Ken Auletta, all of whom helped get this project launched and provided invaluable support along the way. Alice Mayhew, who has been my editor at Simon &amp; Schuster for thirty years, and Jonathan Karp, the publisher, both were extraordinarily diligent and attentive in shepherding this book, as was Amanda Urban, my agent. Crary Pullen was dogged in tracking down photos, and my assistant, Pat Zindulka, calmly facilitated things. I also want to thank my father, Irwin, and my daughter, Betsy, for reading the book and offering advice. And as always, I am most deeply indebted to my wife, Cathy, for her editing, suggestions, wise counsel, and so very much more.</p>
