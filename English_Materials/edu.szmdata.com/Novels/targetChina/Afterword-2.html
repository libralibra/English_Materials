<p class="storyTitle">Afterword:<br/>Washington Foments a Color Revolution in Hong Kong against China</p>
<p>On September 27, 2014, Washington’s State Department and the bevy of “democracy” NGOs it controls issued the order to begin a full-scale Color Revolution protest in China’s Hong Kong.</p>
<p>The Washington neo-cons and their allies in the US State Department and Obama Administration are clearly furious with China, as they are with Russia’s Vladimir Putin. As both Russia and China in recent years have become more assertive about defining their national interests, and as both Eurasian powers draw into a closer cooperation on all strategic levels, Washington has decided to unleash havoc against Beijing, as it has unleashed the Ukraine disorder against Russia and Russian links to the EU. The flurry of recent deals binding Beijing and Moscow more closely – the $400 billion gas pipeline, the BRICS infrastructure bank, trade in rubles and renminbi by-passing the US dollar – has triggered Washington’s response. It’s called the Hong Kong ‘Umbrella Revolution’ in the popular media.</p>
<p>The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China was targeted for a color revolution, one that was dubbed in the media as the Umbrella Revolution, after the umbrellas that protesters use to block police tear gas.</p>
<p>The “umbrellas” for Hong Kong’s ongoing Umbrella Revolution were planned in Washington. Proof of that lies not only in the rapid White House open support of Occupy Central just hours after it began, following the same model they used in Ukraine.<a name="b_365"></a><a href="#_ftn365"><sup>[365]</sup></a> The US State Department and NGOs it finances had been quietly preparing these protests for years.</p>
<p class="subTitle">Same dirty old cast of characters…</p>
<p>Washington unleashed another of its infamous Color Revolutions, as it had done since 2000 in Yugoslavia, in Ukraine, Georgia, Iran, Egypt and beyond. The aim in Hong Kong was to challenge Beijing’s right to politically control future elections, and to unleash similar protests inside China itself, as the CIA had done in the 1989 Tiananmen Square student protests.</p>
<p>US Government-steered NGOs and US-trained operatives were running the entire Hong Kong “Occupy Central” protests, ostensibly in protest against the rules Beijing has announced for Hong Kong’s 2017 elections. The Occupy Central Hong Kong “spontaneous” protest movement was being nominally led by a 17-year-old student, Joshua Wong, who resembles a Hong Kong version of Harry Potter, a kid who was only just born the year Britain reluctantly ended its 99-year colonial occupation, ceding the city-state back to the Peoples’ Republic. Wong is accompanied in Occupy Central leadership by a University of Minnesota-educated hedge fund money man for the protests, Edward Chin; by a Yale University-educated sociologist, Chan Kin-man; by a Baptist minister who is a veteran of the CIAs 1989 Tiananmen Square destabilization, Chu Yiu-ming; and by a Hong Kong University law professor, Benny Tai Yiu-ting, or Benny Tai.</p>
<p>Behind these Hong Kong faces, the US State Department ran the Occupy Central destabilization, through its favorite NGO, the US Congress-financed National Endowment for Democracy (NED), and its daughter, the National Democratic Institute (NDI).</p>
<p>The US State Department role began at the top with Chu Yiu-ming, the Baptist minister chosen to head Occupy Central. The most reverend Chu Yiu-ming was also a founder and member of the executive committee of a key NGO, the Hong Kong Human Rights Monitor (HKHRM). HKHRM, as they openly admit on their website, was mainly financed by the US State Department via its neo-conservative Color Revolution NGO (NED).</p>
<p>As they state their purpose: “HKHRM briefs the press, the United Nations, local and overseas governments and legislative bodies on Hong Kong human rights issues both orally and through written reports.”<a name="b_366"></a><a href="#_ftn366"><sup>[366]</sup></a> In their 2013 Annual Report, the NED reported giving Rev. Chu Yiu-ming’s HK Human Rights Monitor a grant of US $145,000. You can buy a boatload of umbrellas for that.<a name="b_367"></a><a href="#_ftn367"><sup>[367]</sup></a> Chu’s HKHRM also worked with another NED-financed creation, the Alliance for Reform and Democracy in Asia (ARDA).<a name="b_368"></a><a href="#_ftn368"><sup>[368]</sup></a></p>
<p>When Occupy Central top figures decided to (undemocratically) name Chu as their leader in January, 2014, Chu himself said it was because “I have more connections with different activist groups, and experience in large-scale social campaigns.”<a name="b_369"></a><a href="#_ftn369"><sup>[369]</sup></a> He should have named NED as activist group and the CIA’s 1989 Tiananmen Square as a “large-scale social campaign, to be more specific. The Baptist preacher admitted that he was named de facto leader of Occupy Central by two other leading organizers of the civil disobedience movement, Benny Tai Yiu-ting and Dr Chan Kin-man, who wanted him “to take up” the role.<a name="b_370"></a><a href="#_ftn370"><sup>[370]</sup></a> It was an insider move, “with no broad voting.</p>
<p>Benny Tai was also familiar with the US State Department. Tai, law professor at the University of Hong Kong and co-founder of Hong Kong Occupy Central, worked with the Hong Kong University Centre for Comparative and Public Law, which receives grants from the NED subsidiary, National Democratic Institute, for projects like Design Democracy Hong Kong. The Centre Annual Report states, “With funding assistance from the National Democratic Institute, the Design Democracy Hong Kong website was built to promote a lawful and constructive bottom-up approach to constitutional and political reform in Hong Kong.”<a name="b_371"></a><a href="#_ftn371"><sup>[371]</sup></a> On its own website, NDI describes its years-long Hong Kong law project, the legal backdrop to the Occupy demands which essentially would open the door for a US-picked government in Hong Kong, just as Victoria Nuland hand-picked a US-loyal coup regime in Ukraine in February 2014. The NDI boasts,</p>
<p>The Centre for Comparative and Public Law (CCPL) at the University of Hong Kong, with support from NDI, is working to amplify citizens’ voices in that consultation process by creating Design Democracy Hong Kong (www.designdemocracy.hk), a unique and neutral website that gives citizens a place to discuss the future of Hong Kong’s electoral system.<a name="b_372"></a><a href="#_ftn372"><sup>[372]</sup></a></p>
<p>The Hong Kong wunderkind of the Color Revolution Washington destabilization, 17-year-old student, Joshua Wong, founded a Facebook site called Scholarism when he was 15, with support from Washington’s neo-conservative National Endowment for Democracy via its left branch, National Democratic Institute and NDI’s NDItech project.<a name="b_373"></a><a href="#_ftn373"><sup>[373]</sup></a> And another Occupy Central leading figure, Audrey Eu Yuet-mee, recently met with Vice President Joe Biden.<a name="b_374"></a><a href="#_ftn374"><sup>[374]</sup></a></p>
<p class="subTitle">Cardinal Zen and cardinal sin…</p>
<p>Less visible in the mainstream media but identified as one of the key organizers of Occupy Central was Catholic Cardinal Emeritus Joseph Zen Ze-kiun, the sixth bishop of Hong Kong, a perennial thorn in the side of the Chinese authorities. Cardinal Zen, a veteran protestor though in his 80’s, was playing a key role in the US-financed protests against Beijing’s authority.<a name="b_375"></a><a href="#_ftn375"><sup>[375]</sup></a> Cardinal Zen also happened to be the primary Vatican adviser on China policy. It looked as though the first Jesuit Pope in history, Pope Francis, was making a US-financed retry at the mission of Society of Jesus founder (and, incidentally, the Pope’s real namesake) Francis Xavier, to subvert and take over the Peoples’ Republic of China, using Hong Kong as the Achilles Heel.</p>
<p>Vice President Joe Biden, whose own hands were soaked with the blood of thousands of eastern Ukraine victims of the neo-nazi civil war; Cardinal Zen; Reverend Chu; Joshua Wong; Benny Tai and the neo-conservative NED and its NDI and a bevy of other State Department assets and NGO’s too numerous to name here, ignited a full-blown Color Revolution aimed to target China – the Umbrella Revolution. The timing of the action, a full two years before the Hong Kong 2017 elections, suggested that some people in Washington and elsewhere in the West were getting nervous.</p>
<p>The growing Eurasian economic space of China in conjunction with Putin’s Russia and their guiding role in creating a peaceful and very effective counter-pole to Washington’s New World (dis-) Order, acting through organizations such as the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and BRICS, was the real target of their Occupy disorders. That was really quite stupid of them, but then, they are fundamentally stupid people who despise intelligence, and who fail to see the connections of their actions to the global totality.</p>
