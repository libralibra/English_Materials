<p class="storyTitle">1 The Real Thing</p>
<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">T</span>heir first date was at
Houston's, a restaurant in Irvine, where he opened the door for her and
put her napkin on her lap. Candles flickered along the polished-mahogany
 bar; jazz drifted from speakers; conversation purred.</p>
<p>Debra Newell had taken pains to look good. Her cornsilk-blond hair
fell in waves over her shoulders. High black Gucci heels, designer
jeans, Chanel bag. At 59, married and divorced four times, she had begun
 to worry that she was too old for another chance at love. Her four kids
 were grown, she ran a flourishing interior design firm, and she was
looking for a man to share her success with.</p>

Meehan had their first date. (Christina House / Los Angeles Times)
 </p>
</center>
<p>Her date was 55, 6 feet 2, with hard-jawed good looks and a
gym-sculpted frame. He looked a little weathered, and he dressed lazily&#151;
 shorts and an ill-matching preppy shirt&#151;but he might have once been
an All-American quarterback on a trading card.</p>
<p>His name was John Meehan. He had thick dark hair and a warm, friendly
 smile that invited trust. His eyes were hazel-green, with the quality
of canceling out the whole of the world that wasn't her, their current
focus.</p>
</aside>
<p>It was October 2014. They had found each other on an over-50 dating
site, and she thought his profile&#151;Christian, divorced, physician&#151;
seemed safe. She had been on three other recent dates, but the men were
less handsome than their profile photos, and the talk was dull.</p>
<p>John was different. He showed keen interest in the details of her
life and business. He didn't want to talk just about himself, even
though his stories were riveting. He told her all about being an
anesthesiologist in Iraq, where he'd just spent a year with Doctors
Without Borders.</p>

 <center>
 <img width="80%" src="../COMMON/imgs/DirtyJohn/1/900x400_002.html"/>
 <p class="z">
 John told Debra he was the best thing that would ever happen to her.
 </p>

 <p class="z">
 This is the first photograph of herself she sent to John.
 </p>
 </center>

<p>He said he had a couple of kids. That he owned houses in Newport
Beach and Palm Springs. That he happened to worship at her church,
Mariners. That he would love to meet her grandkids.</p>
<p>And he told her that she stopped his heart, she was so beautiful. She
 was just his type. Her last serious boyfriend had wounded her, in
parting, when he said she wasn't.</p>
<p>John began caressing her back. She thought this was moving a little
fast, but she decided to allow it. The intensity of his attention was
flattering.</p>
<p>She brought John back to her penthouse, just up the block. They
kissed. He wanted it to go further. "This feels incredible," he said,
stretching out on her bed.</p>
<p>She thought, "It's just a mattress."</p>
<p>She became uncomfortable. It turned into a fight. He just didn't want to leave, and she had to insist.</p>
<p>She went to bed thinking, "Jerk."</p>
<p>She thought, "Cross off another one."</p>
<hr />
<p>The next day she was back at her office, a little sad, trying to lose
 herself in work. Over the 30 years that she had built Ambrosia Interior
 Design, it had been her refuge amid many romantic disappointments. Work
 was the realm in which her success was unqualified.</p>
<p>She designed model homes and clubhouses. She liked to hire single
women and mothers because she could remember how it felt to be alone,
with one child and another on the way, after her first marriage broke
up.</p>
<p>When people walked into one of her exquisitely arranged rooms, they
were invited to imagine their futures in them. She called them
"approachable dreams." They were like glossy ads in upscale lifestyle
magazines&#151;purged of kids' toys and dirty dishes and other real-world
complications.</p>
<p>In her big Irvine warehouse, among the vases and mirrors and other
decorative bric-a-brac, stood shelves of color-coordinated hardback
books&#151;aqua, navy, gray, brown&#151;because books made nice furniture in
perfect homes. She hunted at weekend library sales. The titles didn't
matter, as long as they omitted the words "sex" and "death."</p>
<p>Her perfect rooms were like the face you presented on dates, inviting
 people to fantasize about the piece that may complete their lives. If
your eagerness or loneliness or desperation showed too soon, you were
done. Maybe that had been John's mistake.</p>
<p>That day he called to say he was sorry. He knew he'd overstepped. He just wanted to spend every minute with her.</p>
<hr />
<p>By the second or third date, he was telling her he loved her, that he
 wanted to marry her. She didn't mind his idiosyncrasies, like his habit
 of wearing his faded blue medical scrubs everywhere, even to a
formal-dress cancer benefit she invited him to. Some people snickered,
but she thought, "Busy doctor."</p>
<center>

 <p class="z">
 Debra Newell and John Meehan attend a formal-dress cancer benefit in Orange County.
 He arrived in his faded blue medical scrubs. He seemed to wear them everywhere.
 </p>
</center>
<p>"So you are the real thing," she texted him after one date.</p>
<p>"Best thing that will ever happen to you," he replied.</p>
<p>He began spending the night regularly at her Irvine penthouse. Her
24-year-old daughter, Jacquelyn, who lived there with her, made it clear
 she thought he looked like a loser. Maybe even homeless.</p>
<p>She said she didn't like the way his eyes roamed around the place,
among their velvet chairs and jewelry and fine art. Or the way he seemed
 so curious about the contents of her safe, where she kept her
collection of Birkin and Cartier bags. Get this creep out of here, she
told her mom.</p>
<p>Jacquelyn's reaction didn't shock Debra, since her taste in men often
 exasperated her children. She thought they'd find something bad to say
about anyone she dated. Her friends sometimes joked about her being a
"bad picker." Where other people saw red flags, she saw a parade.</p>
<hr />
<p>Soon Debra and John were quietly looking for a place together. They
found a $6,500-a-month house on the boardwalk on Balboa Island in
Newport Beach. She put down a year in advance. He didn't want his name
on the lease. Tax problems, he said. They'd known each other five weeks.</p>
<p>Debra wasn't about to tell her kids that John would be moving in with
 her. She knew what they'd say&#151;that she was moving too fast, acting
with her heart, repeating old mistakes.</p>
<p>What her kids <em>didn't</em> see was how well he treated her. How he
 brought her coffee in the morning. Got her groceries. Took her Tesla
and Range Rover in for maintenance. Carried her purse.</p>
<p>She was convinced that her kids would understand how wonderful he was
 once they got to know him. She thought that if any of her kids would
give him a chance, it was Terra, her youngest.</p>
<center>
 <img width="80%" src="../COMMON/imgs/DirtyJohn/1/terra-jimmy.html"/>
 <p class="z">
 Terra Newell, here with her then-boyfriend, Jimmy, was Debra's
youngest daughter. She felt protective of her mom and wondered why a guy
 who sounded as good as John would still be single.
 </p>
</center>
<hr />
<p>The family's quietest, most docile member liked to daydream about the end of the world.</p>
<p>At 23, Terra watched and rewatched every episode of "The Walking
Dead." She spoke of the series less as entertainment than as a primer on
 how to survive apocalyptic calamity.</p>
<p>She made careful note of why some characters lived and others
perished. It had to do with vigilance and quick reflexes and the will to
 fight. "The world ends," she would say, "and those who are fit to
survive will survive."</p>
<p>She was as nonconfrontational as her sister Jacquelyn was assertive. The first word people used to describe her was "sweet."</p>
<p>She was living in Las Vegas with her boyfriend, Jimmy, and studying
to be a dog groomer. She knew her mom liked to take care of people, and
that she saw the best in men, at times against all evidence. Sometimes
they pretended to be sincere churchgoing Christians. Terra had seen her
scared, screamed at, hit, taken for money.</p>
<p>She felt protective of her mom and wondered why a guy who sounded as
good as John would still be single. Her skepticism only deepened when
she and Jimmy drove out to Southern California and met him.</p>
<hr />
<p>John towered over her by a full foot, and a coldness came off him. He
 barely made eye contact. He cut her questions short. As he helped Debra
 move into her new house, he huffed and strained and wrestled her queen
mattress down the stairs single-handedly, a show of ludicrous machismo.</p>
<p>Terra's three dogs seemed anxious around John. She thought maybe they were picking up on her own unease.</p>
<p>She brooded on some questions. What kind of doctor had no car? Why
had no one seen John's houses in Newport Beach and Palm Springs? Why did
 he seem to spend all day playing "Call of Duty" on the 70-inch plasma
TV her mom had bought?</p>
<hr />
<p>Terra and her boyfriend moved into the spare bedroom of the new
Balboa Island rental for a few days. This made it hard for Debra to
maintain the illusion that John wasn't really living there, though she
tried.</p>
<p>Terra discovered the truth the day before Thanksgiving, when she
opened a closet and found a nursing certificate bearing John's name. Her
 mom said she was getting his certificates framed, but Terra knew, and
she did something uncharacteristic. She confronted her loudly.</p>
<p>Here came John, instantly transformed by rage. Why was Terra snooping
 through his stuff? Why was she trying to steal Debra from him? Did she
realize that kids should be smacked for this?</p>
<p>Terra screamed at her mother: "How could you let this guy talk to me like this?!"</p>
<p>Terra left, badly shaken, with the sickening feeling that her mother was choosing John over her.</p>
<hr />
<p>"They're jealous."</p>
<p>That was John's explanation for her kids' hostility to him. They
didn't want her to be happy. They just wanted her dead, so they could
collect.</p>
<p>He had an explanation for why he had a nursing degree but called
himself a doctor. He said he had a PhD, which earned him the title, plus
 advanced training in anesthesiology.</p>
<p>At the big Thanksgiving party the next day, it was impossible to
ignore the sudden fissures in the family&#151;impossible to ignore Terra's
absence. But others were willing to give John a chance.</p>
<p>Debra's mother, Arlane, thought he dressed tackily, especially for
Thanksgiving. But she made allowances for a busy professional. And he
was so nice and courteous. "I think he's a great guy," she told Debra.</p>
<p>When Jacquelyn showed up, John asked for a private word with her. She
 announced that he was the devil, that anything he had to say he could
say in public.</p>
<hr />
<p>To John, this was more evidence that Debra's kids were spoiled and out of control. His words tugged at her anxieties.</p>
<p>She wanted a professional's objective advice. She found a therapist,
who assessed the family dynamics and told Debra she needed to establish
firmer boundaries with her children.</p>
<p>If they wanted to come over, they had to be invited. They couldn't yell at her. They couldn't try to run her life.</p>
<p>They couldn't sabotage her happiness&#151;she had a right to it, just
like anybody else. If John was the man she had chosen, it was her
business.</p>
<p>Absolutely, John said.</p>
<hr />
<p>Their house on the boardwalk had floor-to-ceiling windows, and from
the rooftop deck they could watch the sailboats and the great yachts
slide over Newport Harbor. Water lapped against a ribbon of sand yards
from their front door, and they could hear the tall, wind-rustled palms
and the muted creaking of the boat docks.</p>
<p>They were living inside a postcard. They walked the island
hand-in-hand. He doted on passing babies and dogs. He liked to
play-wrestle her grandkids. He acted like a kid himself, vulnerable and
sweet, and single-mindedly besotted with her.</p>

<p>He liked to pose shirtless and take selfies of his washboard abs. She
 smiled when he'd stop in front of a mirror and say, "Damn! I'm
good-looking."</p>
<p>Wardrobe-wise, she thought he was kind of a mess, with his baggy
pants and University of Arizona sweatshirts. He said his clothes had
been stolen while he was in Iraq.</p>
<p>"Dress me," he told her. "I want to please you."</p>
<p>She took him to Brooks Brothers. She bought him shoes, dress shirts,
slacks, a tweed sport coat, form-fitting cashmere sweaters&#151;deep
burgundy, navy blue. He looked good in darker tones and pastels. It felt
 like having a new doll.</p>
<hr />
<p>He kept begging her to marry him, and she kept resisting, until she
couldn't. In early December, she was driving to Vegas on business, and
he was tagging along. Why not drop by the courthouse?</p>
<p>The ceremony was in a plain room with a plant-covered trellis. He
chuckled a little as he tried to get the ring on her finger. They
celebrated with lemon-drop martinis. They had known each other less than
 two months. No one had been invited to the wedding.</p>
<center>
 <img width="80%" src="../COMMON/imgs/DirtyJohn/1/900_003.html"/>
 <p class="z">
 John had repeatedly begged her to marry him. In December 2014,
while she was on a business trip in Las Vegas, they exchanged vows.
 </p>
</center>
<p>Debra would say, "I felt this was an opportunity to love again."</p>
<hr />
<p>She kept it a secret as the weeks passed and Christmas approached.
The family planned to have their traditional Christmas get-together at
the Orange County home of Debra's eldest daughter, Nicole.</p>
<p>Jacquelyn refused to go. Terra was torn. She desperately wanted to
spend the holiday with her little nieces and nephews, but she didn't
even want to look at John.</p>
<p>Terra went to a therapist with her mom. They came to an understanding
 that Terra and John would keep their distance during the party.</p>
<p>The day came, and John bustled in with his arms full of presents for
the children&#151;dozens of presents Debra had bought. The kids surrounded
him. Terra began crying hysterically. It became a scene.</p>
<p>"You promised he wouldn't hang out with the kids," Terra told her mom.</p>
<p>Terra's grandmother found her in the family room, trembling and crying.</p>
<p>"I just want to leave," Terra said. "I don't like him. There's something about him."</p>
<hr />
<p>Terra knew what people were thinking: "There she goes again, being
overemotional." She was the youngest in the family, her parents split up
 when she was young, and she'd been looked after by nannies during the
years her mom built her business.</p>
<p>She knew some people still thought of her as the little girl who
needed attention. It was sometimes a fight to be taken seriously, and
she would question the intensity of her own feelings.</p>
<p>In early 2015, Terra was back home in Vegas, with Jimmy and their
dogs. Terra wasn't talking to her mom. She just hoped John would go
away.</p>
<hr />
<p>Back in Orange County, Jacquelyn was thinking about John's fingernails. They were dirty.</p>
<p>She had spent time around doctors, during the time she worked in
sales for a plastic surgeon. Their nails were meticulously clipped and
scrubbed.</p>
<p>Plus, the doctors she had known did not go everywhere in their
scrubs, as John did. She thought he looked like a man wearing a costume.</p>
<p>Something else was wrong with John's scrubs: the bottoms were frayed
around the heels as if they belonged to a medical-office receptionist
who ran errands in tennis shoes.</p>
<p>Other things unsettled Jacquelyn, like the slangy, misspelled texts
she received from her mom's number that were clearly not from her. And
the way her mom kept calling to complain that money was missing from her
 wallet. Had Jacquelyn dropped by her office to borrow some?</p>
<p>Jacquelyn told her to think about the loser she was dating. She
thought her mom, so nice and trusting and naive, had no idea who he was.</p>
<p>Jacquelyn bought a magnetic tracker and put it on her mother's Tesla
to monitor John's movements when he left the house. He said he traveled
between clinics and operating rooms, doing anesthesiology work as
needed, but who knew? Debra would not remember agreeing to the tracker,
but Jacquelyn insisted she asked.</p>
<p>From her iPhone, Jacquelyn began studying the strange routes he took
around Southern California, looking for patterns and clues. He went to
doctors' offices in Irvine and Mission Viejo and San Diego, a warehouse,
 a post office, fast-food joints, Tesla charging portals.</p>
<p>Jacquelyn knew she had to be careful about what she told her mom&#151;it
 could get back to John. She didn't want to be dismissed as a meddler.
And none of what she found was necessarily incompatible with his story.
These were fragments of a puzzle.</p>
<p>When she told Terra what she was doing, Terra asked, "What if he hurts her?"</p>
<hr />
<p>In Debra Newell's family, the question carried a freight of unspoken dread, because the worst had happened before.</p>
<p>In 1984, her older sister, Cindi, had been trying to escape a husband
 she described as controlling and possessive. One day he pressed a
handgun against the back of her neck and pulled the trigger.</p>
<p>It was the reason Debra hated firearms. It was the reason she refused
 to have one around, long after people began warning her that she needed
 one.</p>
