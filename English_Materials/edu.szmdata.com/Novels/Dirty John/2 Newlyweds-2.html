<p class="storyTitle">2 Newlyweds</p>
<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">A</span>fter church one Sunday, Debra Newell walked into the living room with her husband to find a woman she did not recognize.</p>
<p>The stranger sat trance-like before the big window that overlooked
Newport Harbor, a thin, weathered woman in her late 30s or early 40s.
She had just used the shower; her curly blond hair was wet. She was
dressed all in white; she had taken Debra's clothes. She held a tiny
Bible and sipped Ovaltine. She acted like she belonged there, though she
 wouldn't meet their eyes.</p>
<p>John pushed her head onto the countertop and pulled her arms behind
her back. He ordered Debra to leave the house and call the police. Debra
 didn't want to press charges. She figured the woman was homeless, maybe
 a drug addict, and had climbed in through the third-floor skylight.</p>
<p>John denied knowing her, but Debra wondered. Had he said something to
 the woman before police took her away? Had he warned her not to reveal
their connection? Had she been to the house before, and learned of its
unlocked entrance?</p>
<p>John announced they needed to ramp up security. Even in a
$6,500-a-month bayfront rental they couldn't be too careful about
drifters. Soon the home bristled with cameras that he monitored on his
smartphone. He also insisted on cameras at the Irvine office of her
interior design firm. He just wanted her to be safe.</p>
<p>Is he watching me? Debra wondered.</p>
<p>And she thought: I can watch him, too.</p>
<hr />
<p>She didn't know where he went all day, when he kissed her goodbye and
 disappeared in her Tesla. He never brought home a paycheck, but that
was easily explained&#151;as a freelance anesthesiologist who traveled
between operating rooms, he was paid in cash by the uninsured.</p>
<p>One day, she pulled up the security footage and saw that John wasn't
going off to work like he said. She watched him leave the house in his
blue scrubs, return a little later, climb into bed and go to sleep.</p>
<p>She debated whether to confront him. He could become so volatile when challenged, as he had with her children.</p>
<p>She decided to ask, but not in an accusatory tone that might upset him. Gently.</p>
<p>"The patient failed a treadmill test and they had to cancel the surgery," John explained instantly, nonchalance itself.</p>
<p>She didn't press him any further. Questions might puncture the dream.</p>
<hr />
<p>Debra knew so little about her husband, beyond the way he made her feel. At 59, she'd never been happier with a man.</p>
<p>He ran her errands, the way her assistants usually did. Made sure her
 bills were paid. Sat beside her at doctors' appointments. Brought her
bouquets of peonies, her favorite flower. Held her all night, breathing
against her neck, his weightlifter's body draped over hers.</p>

<p>She wondered about the scars that crossed his abdomen and back, legs
and ankles. He said he'd been in a chopper crash as a medic in the war
zones of the Middle East, just before meeting her. He praised the
accuracy of "American Sniper," the film about a sharpshooter in Iraq.</p>
<p>During his time in the desert, he said, he had learned something
about himself. Five or six times, he'd had to kill. It was easy, if you
had to.</p>
<p>Ruthlessness was in his genes, he explained. He bragged that he was a
 blood relation of the notorious Mafia hit man who once ran Murder Inc.
He didn't show a violent side himself, except the time he grabbed the
shirt of a homeless guy who said something rude to Debra on a Seattle
street. John screamed in his face, and Debra had to pull him away.</p>
<p>He told her she made him a better man. They attended Mariners, an
evangelical megachurch in Irvine, with modern worship music, keyboards
and guitars. John always seemed excited to go.</p>
<p>He said he'd attended the church before he met her, though once he
slipped up and called the pastor a priest. She thought it was because
he'd been raised Catholic.</p>
<p>She watched him inject testosterone. He said this was for his
kidneys. She watched him pop OxyContin. He said this was for his bad
back.</p>
<hr />
<p>Debra had been telling her nephew, Shad Vickers, all about the
handsome doctor who seemed to live only for her, and when Shad met him
he thought, "A good, fun guy." He was impressed with John's confidence
and tales of battlefield derring-do. Most of all, he was glad to see his
 aunt happy. She'd been looking for so long.</p>
<p>Shad and Debra had always been close. For years he had thought of her
 as a second mother. Their bond was forged by a shared experience of
unhealable horror. When Shad was a boy in 1984, as his parents were
splitting up, his father shot his mother to death and went to prison.
The victim was Cindi, Debra's older sister.</p>
<p>Debra treated Shad like one of her own kids. She brought him on
family vacations. She paid for his football and track leagues, which
gave the traumatized boy some focus and release. She gave him a job in
her furniture warehouse. She stuck with him during the years his rage
and confusion were at their worst, during the brawls and scrapes with
the law.</p>
<p>Now he was a single father in his 40s with three daughters,
gregarious and sweet-tempered, with a job at a trucking company, and he
loved his aunt and hoped John would make her happy. Shad brought his
kids over to the beachfront house, and John was great with them.</p>
<p>Shad knew some people in the family disliked John&#151;Debra's daughter
Jacquelyn had sized him up as a con man and been especially vocal in her
 contempt&#151;but he was willing to give him a chance. He tried not to
judge people too soon.</p>

 </p>
</center>
<p>He did have some questions. Like why had he come into Debra's life
with only a few old clothes? Why did he play video games all day long?
Did doctors really jump out of helicopters with machine guns?</p>
<p>Then John said something that didn't sit right. It was at Debra's
place in late February 2015, and John was making margaritas in the
kitchen when Jacquelyn's name came up.</p>
<p>"I could take her out from a thousand yards," John said, and Shad would recall that Debra laughed, not taking it seriously.</p>
<!--take the survey for social-->
<p>Shad thought it wasn't a thing to joke about, even if you'd been to a
 war zone and had a war zone sense of humor. It seemed kind of sick,
actually.</p>
<p>He began to fear for his aunt. So when he got word that some of
Debra's kids had hired a private investigator to look into John's past&#151;
 when he learned that a preliminary report had come back&#151;he wanted to
know everything.</p>
<p>He studied the report. John had a bankruptcy. A nursing license, not a
 doctor's license. Addresses in Arizona, Ohio, Indiana, Tennessee and
across California, including a recent one at a trailer park in the
desert of Riverside County.</p>
<p>His curiosity gnawing at him, Shad called the trailer park. A woman
answered. Shad thought up a lie, saying his mother had married John
Meehan, and could she tell him anything about him? The woman said John
had lived there. They'd had a relationship. He had disappeared. She hung
 up.</p>
<p>There was another address linked to John Meehan: 550 N. Flower St. in Santa Ana. The Orange County jail.</p>
<hr />
<p>Shad wanted to warn Debra without telling her too much. What if he
was wrong? What if the man in the report was a different John Meehan?</p>
<p>In early March 2015, Shad called Debra and reminded her that he'd
lost his mom, and he didn't want to lose her too. He said, "What if he
isn't who he says he is? What if he isn't an anesthesiologist? What if I
 could prove to you he was in jail, and not Iraq?"</p>
<p>Her response would stay in his memory: "Even if it was true, I wouldn't care, because I love him."</p>
<p>And because she loved him, Debra relayed Shad's remarks right to John. And John decided that Shad was his enemy.</p>
<p>"Why don't you simply go away," John texted him. "You're not invited
here. You come near and I call the cops.&#160;...&#160;Worry about your own
miserable life and I'll worry about Debbie, who is a lot closer to me
than you can ever imagine. You won't win this."</p>
<p>Shad replied: "You told my grandma and I that you are a doctor. Prove
 it. You told my grandma and I that you own two properties. Prove it.
Once you prove those two, you are good in my book."</p>
<p>John: "I couldn't give a s&#151;- about being in your book."</p>
<p>Shad said he hoped his aunt would open her eyes and dump him.</p>
<p>John: "Boy, are you in for a big surprise."</p>
<p>Shad: "My mom is looking down on me making sure I don't give up on
her sister and making sure I know her sister [knows] the truth about
your lying ass."</p>
<!--support our journalism-->
<p>John: "Good thing your mom ain't here. She'd be embarrassed."</p>
<p>Shad: "It's not a good thing. It's not good at all."</p>
<p>John: "You don't have an aunt anymore. Get it?&#160;...&#160;I ain't going
nowhere and neither is she. Stay away from the house. Accidents do
happen. Again, Deb wants nothing to do with you and if you were on fire I
 wouldn't piss on you to help you out."</p>
<p>Shad: "If I hear of you threatening my aunt or harming her, you will see me."</p>
<p>John: "Please show up.&#160;...&#160;And she ain't your aunt anymore. Just ask her."</p>
<p>John got a lot nastier. He insulted Shad's girlfriend and his little daughters.</p>
<p>John: "It isn't about me or what I've done. It's about you harassing
her to the point where she fears for her life.&#160;...&#160;And by the way, we're
married. That makes your threat my threat."</p>
<p>Shad: "I pray you're not married."</p>
<p>Now the whole family knew the secret.</p>
<p>Shad was a former football player, 5 feet 10, a burly 195 pounds. But
 John had 4 inches on Shad, and probably 25 pounds, and Shad had seen
boxing gloves and a heavy punching bag in the garage. Shad thought John
would be able to overpower him, if it came to that.</p>

 </p>
</center>
<p>And there was a single-minded viciousness about John, a sense that
he'd stop at nothing. For now, Shad decided to keep his distance.</p>
<hr />
<p>The beginning of Debra's own disillusionment came in the mailbox, in the form of a letter from the county jail.</p>
<p>It was addressed to John, from a former jail mate saying hi. Debra tore it open and began reading, there in the walkway.</p>
<!--watch goffard on fb-live-->
<p>She stood there frozen for a minute or two, trying to make sense of it, and then she looked up. John was rushing toward her.</p>
<p>She realized that he had been watching her on camera&#151;that maybe he'd been watching her more than she realized.</p>
<p>He snatched the letter out of her hand. She asked him what this meant. She told him she thought he'd been lying to her.</p>
<p>He demanded to know why she was looking at his mail. Didn't she know it was a felony?</p>
<p>John said his jailhouse correspondent was just a guy he was helping
out&#151;sending him care packages and a little money. He wouldn't admit
he'd been in jail himself.</p>
<hr />
<p>The next day, when John left on one of his mysterious errands, Debra
walked into the home office they shared and began hunting. John was
messy, and his papers were scattered everywhere.</p>
<p>Who exactly had she married?</p>
<p>The answer, she learned with apprehension that crept up on her and
then came in a flood, lay in piles of documents he had made no effort to
 hide.</p>
<p>They told a story of a former nurse anesthetist who became hooked on
surgical painkillers and lost his career. Of a con man who took nasty
pleasure in the mechanics of a dark craft he had mastered, and who
seemed obsessed with humiliating anyone who defied his will.</p>

</center>
<p>From 2005 to 2014&#151;from about the time he got out of prison in
Michigan for drug theft to the time he met Debra Newell in California&#151;
he had seduced, swindled and terrorized multiple women, many of whom he
had met on dating sites while posing as a doctor, court records showed.</p>
<p>"You are my project for years to come," he wrote to a Porter Ranch
woman after allegedly suggesting&#151;in an anonymous letter&#151;that he had
raped her and taken photos while she was unconscious.</p>
<p>"This I promise. Do you think I joke? Every breath I take will be to
ruin your surgically implanted life. Thanks for the pictures!" He
described his planned campaign against her as "my masterpiece."</p>
<p>In another case, according to court records, a 48-year-old Laguna
Beach woman said she had been recovering from brain surgery at a San
Diego hospital when she awoke to find Meehan standing over her bed. He
said he was her anesthesiologist.</p>
<p>They dated. She said her family had millions. He suggested she
transfer money into his account, to hide it from her estranged husband.
She balked. He sent intimate photos of her to her family, and wrote:
"You're in way over your head on this one. Make it happen and I walk
away. If not, I will be your nightmare."</p>

<p>Police began investigating, and when they searched his Riverside
County storage unit, they found a Colt .38 Special. Binoculars. GPS
units. Ammunition. Heavy-duty cable ties. Syringes. A pocket saw. A
bottle of cyanide powder. Eight cyanide capsules.</p>
<p>"A treacherous, cunning and very manipulative person who uses fear
and intimidation as a means to control and coerce his victims," police
called him.</p>
<p>As John Meehan awaited trial in the Orange County jail in late 2013,
an inmate reported that he was offering $10,000 each for the murders of
two Laguna Beach detectives, plus five other potential witnesses against
 him, including several ex-girlfriends and his ex-wife. His philosophy:
"With no witnesses, there is no trial."</p>
<p>To the detectives, one of whom described him as "a ticking bomb,
capable of unpredictable violence," the threat felt real enough to
request a restraining order. But the jail informant refused to be a
witness, no charges were filed for murder solicitation, and the
restraining order was denied.</p>
<p>Meehan pleaded guilty in February 2014 to stalking the Laguna Beach
woman and being a felon in possession of a firearm. He was out that
summer, but jailed again for violating a restraining order against
another woman he had threatened.</p>
<p>He walked out on Oct. 8. He met Debra online two days later. By the
time they married in December 2014, three separate women around Southern
 California had standing restraining orders against him; in recent
years, at least three others had requested them.</p>
<p>"He threatened to leak nude pictures of me if I did not give him money," wrote one woman.</p>
<p>"He was choking me, telling me if I tell the police anything else he'll kill me," wrote another.</p>
<p>"He told me once he was obsessed with me. And I am VERY afraid of him," wrote a third.</p>
<hr />
<p>Debra thought, "I am going to be killed like my sister."</p>
<p>She took Ativan for her nerves and called a lawyer, who told her to
cut her husband out of her will, so he would derive no profit from
murdering her.</p>
<p>She knew she needed to get out of the Balboa Island house, even if
she lost $50,000 she'd paid on the yearlong lease. She had some time to
maneuver, since John had gone to Hoag Hospital for back trouble and&#151;
because of vague complications that necessitated painkillers&#151;had
checked himself in.</p>

<p>Her family helped her pack. In John's possessions they found papers
on which he'd scrawled gun names, codes, phone numbers, jail-inmate
numbers, bank routing numbers.</p>
<p>He'd saved printouts from websites on which women posted warnings about scary and unfaithful men. <em>Datingpsychos.com</em> had devoted multiple pages to him:</p>
<p class="poemLine">He conned me out of money&#160;... He is very persuasive. Emotionally needy&#160;... slick liar&#160;...&#160;</p>
<p class="poemLine">He grabbed me by the throat&#160;...&#160;</p>
<p class="poemLine">Do not let this man into your life&#160;...&#160;</p>
<p class="poemLine">Don't be fooled by his good looks and prince charming personality&#160;...&#160;</p>
<p class="poemLine">He is a parasite, a leech, an infection that festers on anyone he comes in contact with&#160;...&#160;</p>
<p class="poemLine">Trust your intuition, ladies. He is a pathologically rotten apple!</p>
<p class="poemLine">Stay away at all costs!</p>
<p class="poemLine">Classic psychopath&#160;...&#160;</p>
