<p class="storyTitle">XVIII</p>





<p>He reached Innsbruck at dusk, sent his bags up to a hotel and
walked into town. In the sunset the Emperor Maximilian knelt in
prayer above his bronze mourners; a quartet of Jesuit novices
paced and read in the university garden. The marble souvenirs of
old sieges, marriages, anniversaries, faded quickly when the sun
was down, and he had erbsen-suppe with w√ºrstchen cut up in
it, drank four helles of Pilsener and refused a formidable
dessert known as "kaiser-schmarren."</p>

<p>Despite the overhanging mountains Switzerland was far away,
Nicole was far away. Walking in the garden later when it was
quite dark he thought about her with detachment, loving her for
her best self. He remembered once when the grass was damp and she
came to him on hurried feet, her thin slippers drenched with dew.
She stood upon his shoes nestling close and held up her face,
showing it as a book open at a page.</p>

<p>"Think how you love me," she whispered. "I don't ask you to
love me always like this, but I ask you to remember. Somewhere
inside me there'll always be the person I am to-night."</p>

<p>But Dick had come away for his soul's sake, and he began
thinking about that. He had lost himself&#151;he could not tell the
hour when, or the day or the week, the month or the year. Once he
had cut through things, solving the most complicated equations as
the simplest problems of his simplest patients. Between the time
he found Nicole flowering under a stone on the Zurichsee and the
moment of his meeting with Rosemary the spear had been
blunted.</p>

<p>Watching his father's struggles in poor parishes had wedded a
desire for money to an essentially unacquisitive nature. It was
not a healthy necessity for security&#151;he had never felt more sure
of himself, more thoroughly his own man, than at the time of his
marriage to Nicole. Yet he had been swallowed up like a gigolo,
and somehow permitted his arsenal to be locked up in the Warren
safety-deposit vaults.</p>

<p>"There should have been a settlement in the Continental style;
but it isn't over yet. I've wasted eight years teaching the rich
the ABC's of human decency, but I'm not done. I've got too many
unplayed trumps in my hand."</p>

<p>He loitered among the fallow rose bushes and the beds of damp
sweet indistinguishable fern. It was warm for October but cool
enough to wear a heavy tweed coat buttoned by a little elastic
tape at the neck. A figure detached itself from the black shape
of a tree and he knew it was the woman whom he had passed in the
lobby coming out. He was in love with every pretty woman he saw
now, their forms at a distance, their shadows on a wall.</p>

<p>Her back was toward him as she faced the lights of the town.
He scratched a match that she must have heard, but she remained
motionless.</p>

<p>&#151;Was it an invitation? Or an indication of obliviousness? He
had long been outside of the world of simple desires and their
fulfillments, and he was inept and uncertain. For all he knew
there might be some code among the wanderers of obscure spas by
which they found each other quickly.</p>

<p>&#151;Perhaps the next gesture was his. Strange children should
smile at each other and say, "Let's play."</p>

<p>He moved closer, the shadow moved sideways. Possibly he would
be snubbed like the scapegrace drummers he had heard of in youth.
His heart beat loud in contact with the unprobed, undissected,
unanalyzed, unaccounted for. Suddenly he turned away, and, as he
did, the girl, too, broke the black frieze she made with the
foliage, rounded a bench at a moderate but determined pace and
took the path back to the hotel.</p>

<p>With a guide and two other men, Dick started up the
Birkkarspitze next morning. It was a fine feeling once they were
above the cowbells of the highest pastures&#151;Dick looked forward
to the night in the shack, enjoying his own fatigue, enjoying the
captaincy of the guide, feeling a delight in his own anonymity.
But at mid-day the weather changed to black sleet and hail and
mountain thunder. Dick and one of the other climbers wanted to go
on but the guide refused. Regretfully they struggled back to
Innsbruck to start again to-morrow.</p>

<p>After dinner and a bottle of heavy local wine in the deserted
dining-room, he felt excited, without knowing why, until he began
thinking of the garden. He had passed the girl in the lobby
before supper and this time she had looked at him and approved of
him, but it kept worrying him: Why? When I could have had a good
share of the pretty women of my time for the asking, why start
that now? With a wraith, with a fragment of my desire? Why?</p>

<p>His imagination pushed ahead&#151;the old asceticism, the actual
unfamiliarity, triumphed: God, I might as well go back to the
Riviera and sleep with Janice Caricamento or the Wilburhazy girl.
To belittle all these years with something cheap and easy?</p>

<p>He was still excited, though, and he turned from the veranda
and went up to his room to think. Being alone in body and spirit
begets loneliness, and loneliness begets more loneliness.</p>

<p>Upstairs he walked around thinking of the matter and laying
out his climbing clothes advantageously on the faint heater; he
again encountered Nicole's telegram, still unopened, with which
diurnally she accompanied his itinerary. He had delayed opening
it before supper&#151;perhaps because of the garden. It was a
cablegram from Buffalo, forwarded through Zurich.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>"Your father died peacefully tonight. HOLMES."</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He felt a sharp wince at the shock, a gathering of the forces
of resistance; then it rolled up through his loins and stomach
and throat.</p>

<p>He read the message again. He sat down on the bed, breathing
and staring; thinking first the old selfish child's thought that
comes with the death of a parent, how will it affect me now that
this earliest and strongest of protections is gone?</p>

<p>The atavism passed and he walked the room still, stopping from
time to time to look at the telegram. Holmes was formally his
father's curate but actually, and for a decade, rector of the
church. How did he die? Of old age&#151;he was seventy-five. He had
lived a long time.</p>

<p>Dick felt sad that he had died alone&#151;he had survived his
wife, and his brothers and sisters; there were cousins in
Virginia but they were poor and not able to come North, and
Holmes had had to sign the telegram. Dick loved his father&#151;again
and again he referred judgments to what his father would probably
have thought or done. Dick was born several months after the
death of two young sisters and his father, guessing what would be
the effect on Dick's mother, had saved him from a spoiling by
becoming his moral guide. He was of tired stock yet he raised
himself to that effort.</p>

<p>In the summer father and son walked downtown together to have
their shoes shined&#151;Dick in his starched duck sailor suit, his
father always in beautifully cut clerical clothes&#151;and the father
was very proud of his handsome little boy. He told Dick all he
knew about life, not much but most of it true, simple things,
matters of behavior that came within his clergyman's range. "Once
in a strange town when I was first ordained, I went into a
crowded room and was confused as to who was my hostess. Several
people I knew came toward me, but I disregarded them because I
had seen a gray-haired woman sitting by a window far across the
room. I went over to her and introduced myself. After that I made
many friends in that town."</p>

<p>His father had done that from a good heart&#151;his father had
been sure of what he was, with a deep pride of the two proud
widows who had raised him to believe that nothing could be
superior to "good instincts," honor, courtesy, and courage.</p>

<p>The father always considered that his wife's small fortune
belonged to his son, and in college and in medical school sent
him a check for all of it four times a year. He was one of those
about whom it was said with smug finality in the gilded age:
"very much the gentleman, but not much get-up-and-go about
him."</p>

<p>. . . Dick sent down for a newspaper. Still pacing to and from
the telegram open on his bureau, he chose a ship to go to
America. Then he put in a call for Nicole in Zurich, remembering
so many things as he waited, and wishing he had always been as
good as he had intended to be.</p>
