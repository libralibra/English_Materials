<p class="storyTitle">XIV</p>





<p>Dick awoke at five after a long dream of war, walked to the
window and stared out it at the Zugersee. His dream had begun in
sombre majesty; navy blue uniforms crossed a dark plaza behind
bands playing the second movement of Prokofieff's "Love of Three
Oranges." Presently there were fire engines, symbols of disaster,
and a ghastly uprising of the mutilated in a dressing station. He
turned on his bed-lamp light and made a thorough note of it
ending with the half-ironic phrase: "Non-combatant's
shell-shock."</p>

<p>As he sat on the side of his bed, he felt the room, the house
and the night as empty. In the next room Nicole muttered
something desolate and he felt sorry for whatever loneliness she
was feeling in her sleep. For him time stood still and then every
few years accelerated in a rush, like the quick re-wind of a
film, but for Nicole the years slipped away by clock and calendar
and birthday, with the added poignance of her perishable
beauty.</p>

<p>Even this past year and a half on the Zugersee seemed wasted
time for her, the seasons marked only by the workmen on the road
turning pink in May, brown in July, black in September, white
again in Spring. She had come out of her first illness alive with
new hopes, expecting so much, yet deprived of any subsistence
except Dick, bringing up children she could only pretend gently
to love, guided orphans. The people she liked, rebels mostly,
disturbed her and were bad for her&#151;she sought in them the
vitality that had made them independent or creative or rugged,
sought in vain&#151;for their secrets were buried deep in childhood
struggles they had forgotten. They were more interested in
Nicole's exterior harmony and charm, the other face of her
illness. She led a lonely life owning Dick who did not want to be
owned.</p>

<p>Many times he had tried unsuccessfully to let go his hold on
her. They had many fine times together, fine talks between the
loves of the white nights, but always when he turned away from
her into himself he left her holding Nothing in her hands and
staring at it, calling it many names, but knowing it was only the
hope that he would come back soon.</p>

<p>He scrunched his pillow hard, lay down, and put the back of
his neck against it as a Japanese does to slow the circulation,
and slept again for a time. Later, while he shaved, Nicole awoke
and marched around, giving abrupt, succinct orders to children
and servants. Lanier came in to watch his father shave&#151;living
beside a psychiatric clinic he had developed an extraordinary
confidence in and admiration for his father, together with an
exaggerated indifference toward most other adults; the patients
appeared to him either in their odd aspects, or else as
devitalized, over-correct creatures without personality. He was a
handsome, promising boy and Dick devoted much time to him, in the
relationship of a sympathetic but exacting officer and respectful
enlisted man.</p>

<p>"Why," Lanier asked, "do you always leave a little lather on
the top of your hair when you shave?"</p>

<p>Cautiously Dick parted soapy lips: "I have never been able to
find out. I've often wondered. I think it's because I get the
first finger soapy when I make the line of my side-burn, but how
it gets up on top of my head I don't know."</p>

<p>"I'm going to watch it all to-morrow."</p>

<p>"That's your only question before breakfast?"</p>

<p>"I don't really call it a question."</p>

<p>"That's one on you."</p>

<p>Half an hour later Dick started up to the administration
building. He was thirty-eight&#151;still declining a beard he yet had
a more medical aura about him than he had worn upon the Riviera.
For eighteen months now he had lived at the clinic&#151;certainly one
of the best-appointed in Europe. Like Dohmler's it was of the
modern type&#151;no longer a single dark and sinister building but a
small, scattered, yet deceitfully integrated village&#151;Dick and
Nicole had added much in the domain of taste, so that the plant
was a thing of beauty, visited by every psychologist passing
through Zurich. With the addition of a caddy house it might very
well have been a country club. The Eglantine and the Beeches,
houses for those sunk into eternal darkness, were screened by
little copses from the main building, camouflaged strong-points.
Behind was a large truck farm, worked partly by the patients. The
workshops for ergo-therapy were three, placed under a single roof
and there Doctor Diver began his morning's inspection. The
carpentry shop, full of sunlight, exuded the sweetness of
sawdust, of a lost age of wood; always half a dozen men were
there, hammering, planing, buzzing&#151;silent men, who lifted solemn
eyes from their work as he passed through. Himself a good
carpenter, he discussed with them the efficiency of some tools
for a moment in a quiet, personal, interested voice. Adjoining
was the book-bindery, adapted to the most mobile of patients who
were not always, however, those who had the greatest chance for
recovery. The last chamber was devoted to beadwork, weaving and
work in brass. The faces of the patients here wore the expression
of one who had just sighed profoundly, dismissing something
insoluble&#151;but their sighs only marked the beginning of another
ceaseless round of ratiocination, not in a line as with normal
people but in the same circle. Round, round, and round. Around
forever. But the bright colors of the stuffs they worked with
gave strangers a momentary illusion that all was well, as in a
kindergarten. These patients brightened as Doctor Diver came in.
Most of them liked him better than they liked Doctor Gregorovius.
Those who had once lived in the great world invariably liked him
better. There were a few who thought he neglected them, or that
he was not simple, or that he posed. Their responses were not
dissimilar to those that Dick evoked in non-professional life,
but here they were warped and distorted.</p>

<p>One Englishwoman spoke to him always about a subject which she
considered her own.</p>

<p>"Have we got music to-night?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," he answered. "I haven't seen Doctor Ladislau.
How did you enjoy the music that Mrs. Sachs and Mr. Longstreet
gave us last night?"</p>

<p>"It was so-so."</p>

<p>"I thought it was fine&#151;especially the Chopin."</p>

<p>"I thought it was so-so."</p>

<p>"When are you going to play for us yourself?"</p>

<p>She shrugged her shoulders, as pleased at this question as she
had been for several years.</p>

<p>"Some time. But I only play so-so."</p>

<p>They knew that she did not play at all&#151;she had had two
sisters who were brilliant musicians, but she had never been able
to learn the notes when they had been young together.</p>

<p>From the workshop Dick went to visit the Eglantine and the
Beeches. Exteriorly these houses were as cheerful as the others;
Nicole had designed the decoration and the furniture on a
necessary base of concealed grills and bars and immovable
furniture. She had worked with so much imagination&#151;the inventive
quality, which she lacked, being supplied by the problem
itself&#151;that no instructed visitor would have dreamed that the
light, graceful filagree work at a window was a strong,
unyielding end of a tether, that the pieces reflecting modern
tubular tendencies were stancher than the massive creations of
the Edwardians&#151;even the flowers lay in iron fingers and every
casual ornament and fixture was as necessary as a girder in a
skyscraper. Her tireless eyes had made each room yield up its
greatest usefulness. Complimented, she referred to herself
brusquely as a master plumber.</p>

<p>For those whose compasses were not depolarized there seemed
many odd things in these houses. Doctor Diver was often amused in
the Eglantine, the men's building&#151;here there was a strange
little exhibitionist who thought that if he could walk unclothed
and unmolested from the ÃŠtoile to the Place de la Concorde
he would solve many things&#151;and, perhaps, Dick thought, he was
quite right.</p>

<p>His most interesting case was in the main building. The
patient was a woman of thirty who had been in the clinic six
months; she was an American painter who had lived long in Paris.
They had no very satisfactory history of her. A cousin had
happened upon her all mad and gone and after an unsatisfactory
interlude at one of the whoopee cures that fringed the city,
dedicated largely to tourist victims of drug and drink, he had
managed to get her to Switzerland. On her admittance she had been
exceptionally pretty&#151;now she was a living agonizing sore. All
blood tests had failed to give a positive reaction and the
trouble was unsatisfactorily catalogued as nervous eczema. For
two months she had lain under it, as imprisoned as in the Iron
Maiden. She was coherent, even brilliant, within the limits of
her special hallucinations.</p>

<p>She was particularly his patient. During spells of
overexcitement he was the only doctor who could "do anything with
her." Several weeks ago, on one of many nights that she had
passed in sleepless torture Franz had succeeded in hypnotizing
her into a few hours of needed rest, but he had never again
succeeded. Hypnosis was a tool that Dick had distrusted and
seldom used, for he knew that he could not always summon up the
mood in himself&#151;he had once tried it on Nicole and she had
scornfully laughed at him.</p>

<p>The woman in room twenty could not see him when he came
in&#151;the area about her eyes was too tightly swollen. She spoke in
a strong, rich, deep, thrilling voice.</p>

<p>"How long will this last? Is it going to be forever?"</p>

<p>"It's not going to be very long now. Doctor Ladislau tells me
there are whole areas cleared up."</p>

<p>"If I knew what I had done to deserve this I could accept it
with equanimity."</p>

<p>"It isn't wise to be mystical about it&#151;we recognize it as a
nervous phenomenon. It's related to the blush&#151;when you were a
girl, did you blush easily?"</p>

<p>She lay with her face turned to the ceiling.</p>

<p>"I have found nothing to blush for since I cut my wisdom
teeth."</p>

<p>"Haven't you committed your share of petty sins and
mistakes?"</p>

<p>"I have nothing to reproach myself with."</p>

<p>"You're very fortunate."</p>

<p>The woman thought a moment; her voice came up through her
bandaged face afflicted with subterranean melodies:</p>

<p>"I'm sharing the fate of the women of my time who challenged
men to battle."</p>

<p>"To your vast surprise it was just like all battles," he
answered, adopting her formal diction.</p>

<p>"Just like all battles." She thought this over. "You pick a
set-up, or else win a Pyrrhic victory, or you're wrecked and
ruined&#151;you're a ghostly echo from a broken wall."</p>

<p>"You are neither wrecked nor ruined," he told her. "Are you
quite sure you've been in a real battle?"</p>

<p>"Look at me!" she cried furiously.</p>

<p>"You've suffered, but many women suffered before they mistook
themselves for men." It was becoming an argument and he
retreated. "In any case you mustn't confuse a single failure with
a final defeat."</p>

<p>She sneered. "Beautiful words," and the phrase transpiring up
through the crust of pain humbled him.</p>

<p>"We would like to go into the true reasons that brought you
here&#151;" he began but she interrupted.</p>

<p>"I am here as a symbol of something. I thought perhaps you
would know what it was."</p>

<p>"You are sick," he said mechanically.</p>

<p>"Then what was it I had almost found?"</p>

<p>"A greater sickness."</p>

<p>"That's all?"</p>

<p>"That's all." With disgust he heard himself lying, but here
and now the vastness of the subject could only be compressed into
a lie. "Outside of that there's only confusion and chaos. I won't
lecture to you&#151;we have too acute a realization of your physical
suffering. But it's only by meeting the problems of every day, no
matter how trifling and boring they seem, that you can make
things drop back into place again. After that&#151;perhaps you'll be
able again to examine&#151;"</p>

<p>He had slowed up to avoid the inevitable end of his thought:
"&#151;the frontiers of consciousness." The frontiers that artists
must explore were not for her, ever. She was fine-spun,
inbred&#151;eventually she might find rest in some quiet mysticism.
Exploration was for those with a measure of peasant blood, those
with big thighs and thick ankles who could take punishment as
they took bread and salt, on every inch of flesh and spirit.</p>

<p>&#151;Not for you, he almost said. It's too tough a game for
you.</p>

<p>Yet in the awful majesty of her pain he went out to her
unreservedly, almost sexually. He wanted to gather her up in his
arms, as he so often had Nicole, and cherish even her mistakes,
so deeply were they part of her. The orange light through the
drawn blind, the sarcophagus of her figure on the bed, the spot
of face, the voice searching the vacuity of her illness and
finding only remote abstractions.</p>

<p>As he arose the tears fled lava-like into her bandages.</p>

<p>"That is for something," she whispered. "Something must come
out of it."</p>

<p>He stooped and kissed her forehead.</p>

<p>"We must all try to be good," he said.</p>

<p>Leaving her room he sent the nurse in to her. There were other
patients to see: an American girl of fifteen who had been brought
up on the basis that childhood was intended to be all fun&#151;his
visit was provoked by the fact that she had just hacked off all
her hair with a nail scissors. There was nothing much to be done
for her&#151;a family history of neurosis and nothing stable in her
past to build on. The father, normal and conscientious himself,
had tried to protect a nervous brood from life's troubles and had
succeeded merely in preventing them from developing powers of
adjustment to life's inevitable surprises. There was little that
Dick could say: "Helen, when you're in doubt you must ask a
nurse, you must learn to take advice. Promise me you will."</p>

<p>What was a promise with the head sick? He looked in upon a
frail exile from the Caucasus buckled securely in a sort of
hammock which in turn was submerged in a warm medical bath, and
upon the three daughters of a Portuguese general who slid almost
imperceptibly toward paresis. He went into the room next to them
and told a collapsed psychiatrist that he was better, always
better, and the man tried to read his face for conviction, since
he hung on the real world only through such reassurance as he
could find in the resonance, or lack of it, in Doctor Diver's
voice. After that Dick discharged a shiftless orderly and by then
it was the lunch hour.</p>
