<p>She found Campion downstairs in the deserted lobby.</p>

<p>"I saw you go upstairs," he said excitedly. "Is he all right?
When is the duel going to be?"</p>

<p>"I don't know." She resented his speaking of it as a circus,
with McKisco as the tragic clown.</p>

<p>"Will you go with me?" he demanded, with the air of having
seats. "I've hired the hotel car."</p>

<p>"I don't want to go."</p>

<p>"Why not? I imagine it'll take years off my life but I
wouldn't miss it for worlds. We could watch it from quite far
away."</p>

<p>"Why don't you get Mr. Dumphry to go with you?"</p>

<p>His monocle fell out, with no whiskers to hide in&#151;he drew
himself up.</p>

<p>"I never want to see him again."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm afraid I can't go. Mother wouldn't like it."</p>

<p>As Rosemary entered her room Mrs. Speers stirred sleepily and
called to her:</p>

<p>"Where've you been?"</p>

<p>"I just couldn't sleep. You go back to sleep, Mother."</p>

<p>"Come in my room." Hearing her sit up in bed, Rosemary went in
and told her what had happened.</p>

<p>"Why don't you go and see it?" Mrs. Speers suggested. "You
needn't go up close and you might be able to help
afterwards."</p>

<p>Rosemary did not like the picture of herself looking on and
she demurred, but Mrs. Speer's consciousness was still clogged
with sleep and she was reminded of night calls to death and
calamity when she was the wife of a doctor. "I like you to go
places and do things on your own initiative without me&#151;you did
much harder things for Rainy's publicity stunts."</p>

<p>Still Rosemary did not see why she should go, but she obeyed
the sure, clear voice that had sent her into the stage entrance
of the Odeon in Paris when she was twelve and greeted her when
she came out again.</p>

<p>She thought she was reprieved when from the steps she saw Abe
and McKisco drive away&#151;but after a moment the hotel car came
around the corner. Squealing delightedly Luis Campion pulled her
in beside him.</p>

<p>"I hid there because they might not let us come. I've got my
movie camera, you see."</p>

<p>She laughed helplessly. He was so terrible that he was no
longer terrible, only dehumanized.</p>

<p>"I wonder why Mrs. McKisco didn't like the Divers?" she said.
"They were very nice to her."</p>

<p>"Oh, it wasn't that. It was something she saw. We never did
find exactly what it was because of Barban."</p>

<p>"Then that wasn't what made you so sad."</p>

<p>"Oh, no," he said, his voice breaking, "that was something
else that happened when we got back to the hotel. But now I don't
care&#151;I wash my hands of it completely."</p>

<p>They followed the other car east along the shore past Juan les
Pins, where the skeleton of the new Casino was rising. It was
past four and under a blue-gray sky the first fishing boats were
creaking out into a glaucous sea. Then they turned off the main
road and into the back country.</p>

<p>"It's the golf course," cried Campion, "I'm sure that's where
it's going to be."</p>

<p>He was right. When Abe's car pulled up ahead of them the east
was crayoned red and yellow, promising a sultry day. Ordering the
hotel car into a grove of pines Rosemary and Campion kept in the
shadow of a wood and skirted the bleached fairway where Abe and
McKisco were walking up and down, the latter raising his head at
intervals like a rabbit scenting. Presently there were moving
figures over by a farther tee and the watchers made out Barban
and his French second&#151;the latter carried the box of pistols
under his arm.</p>

<p>Somewhat appalled, McKisco slipped behind Abe and took a long
swallow of brandy. He walked on choking and would have marched
directly up into the other party, but Abe stopped him and went
forward to talk to the Frenchman. The sun was over the
horizon.</p>

<p>Campion grabbed Rosemary's arm.</p>

<p>"I can't stand it," he squeaked, almost voiceless. "It's too
much. This will cost me&#151;"</p>

<p>"Let go," Rosemary said peremptorily. She breathed a frantic
prayer in French.</p>

<p>The principals faced each other, Barban with the sleeve rolled
up from his arm. His eyes gleamed restlessly in the sun, but his
motion was deliberate as he wiped his palm on the seam of his
trousers. McKisco, reckless with brandy, pursed his lips in a
whistle and pointed his long nose about nonchalantly, until Abe
stepped forward with a handkerchief in his hand. The French
second stood with his face turned away. Rosemary caught her
breath in terrible pity and gritted her teeth with hatred for
Barban; then:</p>

<p>"One&#151;two&#151;three!" Abe counted in a strained voice.</p>

<p>They fired at the same moment. McKisco swayed but recovered
himself. Both shots had missed.</p>

<p>"Now, that's enough!" cried Abe.</p>

<p>The duellists walked in, and everyone looked at Barban
inquiringly.</p>

<p>"I declare myself unsatisfied."</p>

<p>"What? Sure you're satisfied," said Abe impatiently. "You just
don't know it."</p>

<p>"Your man refuses another shot?"</p>

<p>"You're damn right, Tommy. You insisted on this and my client
went through with it."</p>

<p>Tommy laughed scornfully.</p>

<p>"The distance was ridiculous," he said. "I'm not accustomed to
such farces&#151;your man must remember he's not now in America."</p>

<p>"No use cracking at America," said Abe rather sharply. And
then, in a more conciliatory tone, "This has gone far enough,
Tommy." They parleyed briskly for a moment&#151;then Barban nodded
and bowed coldly to his late antagonist.</p>

<p>"No shake hand?" suggested the French doctor.</p>

<p>"They already know each other," said Abe.</p>

<p>He turned to McKisco.</p>

<p>"Come on, let's get out."</p>

<p>As they strode off, McKisco, in exultation, gripped his
arm.</p>

<p>"Wait a minute!" Abe said. "Tommy wants his pistol back. He
might need it again."</p>

<p>McKisco handed it over.</p>

<p>"To hell with him," he said in a tough voice. "Tell him he
can&#151;"</p>

<p>"Shall I tell him you want another shot?"</p>

<p>"Well, I did it," cried McKisco, as they went along. "And I
did it pretty well, didn't I? I wasn't yellow."</p>

<p>"You were pretty drunk," said Abe bluntly.</p>

<p>"No, I wasn't."</p>

<p>"All right, then, you weren't."</p>

<p>"Why would it make any difference if I had a drink or so?"</p>

<p>As his confidence mounted he looked resentfully at Abe.</p>

<p>"What difference does that make?" he repeated.</p>

<p>"If you can't see it, there's no use going into it."</p>

<p>"Don't you know everybody was drunk all the time during the
war?"</p>

<p>"Well, let's forget it."</p>

<p>But the episode was not quite over. There were urgent
footsteps in the heather behind them and the doctor drew up
alongside.</p>

<p>"Pardon, Messieurs," he panted. "Voulez-vous regler mes
honorairies? Naturellement c'est pour soins médicaux
seulement. M. Barban n'a qu'un billet de mille et ne peut pas les
régler et l'autre a laissé son porte-monnaie chez
lui."</p>

<p>"Trust a Frenchman to think of that," said Abe, and then to
the doctor. "Combien?"</p>

<p>"Let me pay this," said McKisco.</p>

<p>"No, I've got it. We were all in about the same danger."</p>

<p>Abe paid the doctor while McKisco suddenly turned into the
bushes and was sick there. Then paler than before he strutted on
with Abe toward the car through the now rosy morning.</p>

<p>Campion lay gasping on his back in the shrubbery, the only
casualty of the duel, while Rosemary suddenly hysterical with
laughter kept kicking at him with her espadrille. She did this
persistently until she roused him&#151;the only matter of importance
to her now was that in a few hours she would see the person whom
she still referred to in her mind as "the Divers" on the
beach.</p>
