<p class="storyTitle">VII</p>





<p>In a pause Rosemary looked away and up the table where Nicole
sat between Tommy Barban and Abe North, her chow's hair foaming
and frothing in the candlelight. Rosemary listened, caught
sharply by the rich clipped voice in infrequent speech:</p>

<p>"The poor man," Nicole exclaimed. "Why did you want to saw him
in two?"</p>

<p>"Naturally I wanted to see what was inside a waiter. Wouldn't
you like to know what was inside a waiter?"</p>

<p>"Old menus," suggested Nicole with a short laugh. "Pieces of
broken china and tips and pencil stubs."</p>

<p>"Exactly&#151;but the thing was to prove it scientifically. And of
course doing it with that musical saw would have eliminated any
sordidness."</p>

<p>"Did you intend to play the saw while you performed the
operation?" Tommy inquired.</p>

<p>"We didn't get quite that far. We were alarmed by the screams.
We thought he might rupture something."</p>

<p>"All sounds very peculiar to me," said Nicole. "Any musician
that'll use another musician's saw to&#151;"</p>

<p>They had been at table half an hour and a perceptible change
had set in&#151;person by person had given up something, a
preoccupation, an anxiety, a suspicion, and now they were only
their best selves and the Divers' guests. Not to have been
friendly and interested would have seemed to reflect on the
Divers, so now they were all trying, and seeing this, Rosemary
liked everyone&#151;except McKisco, who had contrived to be the
unassimilated member of the party. This was less from ill will
than from his determination to sustain with wine the good spirits
he had enjoyed on his arrival. Lying back in his place between
Earl Brady, to whom he had addressed several withering remarks
about the movies, and Mrs. Abrams, to whom he said nothing, he
stared at Dick Diver with an expression of devastating irony, the
effect being occasionally interrupted by his attempts to engage
Dick in a cater-cornered conversation across the table.</p>

<p>"Aren't you a friend of Van Buren Denby?" he would say.</p>

<p>"I don't believe I know him."</p>

<p>"I thought you were a friend of his," he persisted
irritably.</p>

<p>When the subject of Mr. Denby fell of its own weight, he
essayed other equally irrelative themes, but each time the very
deference of Dick's attention seemed to paralyze him, and after a
moment's stark pause the conversation that he had interrupted
would go on without him. He tried breaking into other dialogues,
but it was like continually shaking hands with a glove from which
the hand had been withdrawn&#151;so finally, with a resigned air of
being among children, he devoted his attention entirely to the
champagne.</p>

<p>Rosemary's glance moved at intervals around the table, eager
for the others' enjoyment, as if they were her future
stepchildren. A gracious table light, emanating from a bowl of
spicy pinks, fell upon Mrs. Abrams' face, cooked to a turn in
Veuve Cliquot, full of vigor, tolerance, adolescent good will;
next to her sat Mr. Royal Dumphry, his girl's comeliness less
startling in the pleasure world of evening. Then Violet McKisco,
whose prettiness had been piped to the surface of her, so that
she ceased her struggle to make tangible to herself her shadowy
position as the wife of an arriviste who had not arrived.</p>

<p>Then came Dick, with his arms full of the slack he had taken
up from others, deeply merged in his own party.</p>

<p>Then her mother, forever perfect.</p>

<p>Then Barban talking to her mother with an urbane fluency that
made Rosemary like him again. Then Nicole. Rosemary saw her
suddenly in a new way and found her one of the most beautiful
people she had ever known. Her face, the face of a saint, a
viking Madonna, shone through the faint motes that snowed across
the candlelight, drew down its flush from the wine-colored
lanterns in the pine. She was still as still.</p>

<p>Abe North was talking to her about his moral code: "Of course
I've got one," he insisted, "&#151;a man can't live without a moral
code. Mine is that I'm against the burning of witches. Whenever
they burn a witch I get all hot under the collar." Rosemary knew
from Brady that he was a musician who after a brilliant and
precocious start had composed nothing for seven years.</p>

<p>Next was Campion, managing somehow to restrain his most
blatant effeminacy, and even to visit upon those near him a
certain disinterested motherliness. Then Mary North with a face
so merry that it was impossible not to smile back into the white
mirrors of her teeth&#151;the whole area around her parted lips was a
lovely little circle of delight.</p>

<p>Finally Brady, whose heartiness became, moment by moment, a
social thing instead of a crude assertion and reassertion of his
own mental health, and his preservation of it by a detachment
from the frailties of others.</p>

<p>Rosemary, as dewy with belief as a child from one of Mrs.
Burnett's vicious tracts, had a conviction of homecoming, of a
return from the derisive and salacious improvisations of the
frontier. There were fireflies riding on the dark air and a dog
baying on some low and far-away ledge of the cliff. The table
seemed to have risen a little toward the sky like a mechanical
dancing platform, giving the people around it a sense of being
alone with each other in the dark universe, nourished by its only
food, warmed by its only lights. And, as if a curious hushed
laugh from Mrs. McKisco were a signal that such a detachment from
the world had been attained, the two Divers began suddenly to
warm and glow and expand, as if to make up to their guests,
already so subtly assured of their importance, so flattered with
politeness, for anything they might still miss from that country
well left behind. Just for a moment they seemed to speak to every
one at the table, singly and together, assuring them of their
friendliness, their affection. And for a moment the faces turned
up toward them were like the faces of poor children at a
Christmas tree. Then abruptly the table broke up&#151;the moment when
the guests had been daringly lifted above conviviality into the
rarer atmosphere of sentiment, was over before it could be
irreverently breathed, before they had half realized it was
there.</p>

<p>But the diffused magic of the hot sweet South had withdrawn
into them&#151;the soft-pawed night and the ghostly wash of the
Mediterranean far below&#151;the magic left these things and melted
into the two Divers and became part of them. Rosemary watched
Nicole pressing upon her mother a yellow evening bag she had
admired, saying, "I think things ought to belong to the people
that like them"&#151;and then sweeping into it all the yellow
articles she could find, a pencil, a lipstick, a little note
book, "because they all go together."</p>

<p>Nicole disappeared and presently Rosemary noticed that Dick
was no longer there; the guests distributed themselves in the
garden or drifted in toward the terrace.</p>

<p>"Do you want," Violet McKisco asked Rosemary, "to go to the
bathroom?"</p>

<p>Not at that precise moment.</p>

<p>"I want," insisted Mrs. McKisco, "to go to the bathroom." As a
frank outspoken woman she walked toward the house, dragging her
secret after her, while Rosemary looked after with reprobation.
Earl Brady proposed that they walk down to the sea wall but she
felt that this was her time to have a share of Dick Diver when he
reappeared, so she stalled, listening to McKisco quarrel with
Barban.</p>

<p>"Why do you want to fight the Soviets?" McKisco said. "The
greatest experiment ever made by humanity? And the Riff? It seems
to me it would be more heroic to fight on the just side."</p>

<p>"How do you find out which it is?" asked Barban dryly.</p>

<p>"Why&#151;usually everybody intelligent knows."</p>

<p>"Are you a Communist?"</p>

<p>"I'm a Socialist," said McKisco, "I sympathize with
Russia."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm a soldier," Barban answered pleasantly. "My
business is to kill people. I fought against the Riff because I
am a European, and I have fought the Communists because they want
to take my property from me."</p>

<p>"Of all the narrow-minded excuses," McKisco looked around to
establish a derisive liaison with some one else, but without
success. He had no idea what he was up against in Barban, neither
of the simplicity of the other man's bag of ideas nor of the
complexity of his training. McKisco knew what ideas were, and as
his mind grew he was able to recognize and sort an increasing
number of them&#151;but faced by a man whom he considered "dumb," one
in whom he found no ideas he could recognize as such, and yet to
whom he could not feel personally superior, he jumped at the
conclusion that Barban was the end product of an archaic world,
and as such, worthless. McKisco's contacts with the princely
classes in America had impressed upon him their uncertain and
fumbling snobbery, their delight in ignorance and their
deliberate rudeness, all lifted from the English with no regard
paid to factors that make English philistinism and rudeness
purposeful, and applied in a land where a little knowledge and
civility buy more than they do anywhere else&#151;an attitude which
reached its apogee in the "Harvard manner" of about 1900. He
thought that this Barban was of that type, and being drunk rashly
forgot that he was in awe of him&#151;this led up to the trouble in
which he presently found himself.</p>

<p>Feeling vaguely ashamed for McKisco, Rosemary waited, placid
but inwardly on fire, for Dick Diver's return. From her chair at
the deserted table with Barban, McKisco, and Abe she looked up
along the path edged with shadowy myrtle and fern to the stone
terrace, and falling in love with her mother's profile against a
lighted door, was about to go there when Mrs. McKisco came
hurrying down from the house.</p>

<p>She exuded excitement. In the very silence with which she
pulled out a chair and sat down, her eyes staring, her mouth
working a little, they all recognized a person crop-full of news,
and her husband's "What's the matter, Vi?" came naturally, as all
eyes turned toward her.</p>

<p>"My dear&#151;" she said at large, and then addressed Rosemary,
"my dear&#151;it's nothing. I really can't say a word."</p>

<p>"You're among friends," said Abe.</p>

<p>"Well, upstairs I came upon a scene, my dears&#151;"</p>

<p>Shaking her head cryptically she broke off just in time, for
Tommy arose and addressed her politely but sharply:</p>

<p>"It's inadvisable to comment on what goes on in this
house."</p>
