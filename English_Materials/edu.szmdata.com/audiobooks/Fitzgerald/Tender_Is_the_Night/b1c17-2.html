<p>It was a house hewn from the frame of Cardinal de Retz's
palace in the Rue Monsieur, but once inside the door there was
nothing of the past, nor of any present that Rosemary knew. The
outer shell, the masonry, seemed rather to enclose the future so
that it was an electric-like shock, a definite nervous
experience, perverted as a breakfast of oatmeal and hashish, to
cross that threshold, if it could be so called, into the long
hall of blue steel, silver-gilt, and the myriad facets of many
oddly bevelled mirrors. The effect was unlike that of any part of
the Decorative Arts Exhibition&#151;for there were people <i>in</i>
it, not in front of it. Rosemary had the detached
false-and-exalted feeling of being on a set and she guessed that
every one else present had that feeling too.</p>

<p>There were about thirty people, mostly women, and all
fashioned by Louisa M. Alcott or Madame de Ségur; and they
functioned on this set as cautiously, as precisely, as does a
human hand picking up jagged broken glass. Neither individually
nor as a crowd could they be said to dominate the environment, as
one comes to dominate a work of art he may possess, no matter how
esoteric, no one knew what this room meant because it was
evolving into something else, becoming everything a room was not;
to exist in it was as difficult as walking on a highly polished
moving stairway, and no one could succeed at all save with the
aforementioned qualities of a hand moving among broken
glass&#151;which qualities limited and defined the majority of those
present.</p>

<p>These were of two sorts. There were the Americans and English
who had been dissipating all spring and summer, so that now
everything they did had a purely nervous inspiration. They were
very quiet and lethargic at certain hours and then they exploded
into sudden quarrels and breakdowns and seductions. The other
class, who might be called the exploiters, was formed by the
sponges, who were sober, serious people by comparison, with a
purpose in life and no time for fooling. These kept their balance
best in that environment, and what tone there was, beyond the
apartment's novel organization of light values, came from
them.</p>

<p>The Frankenstein took down Dick and Rosemary at a gulp&#151;it
separated them immediately and Rosemary suddenly discovered
herself to be an insincere little person, living all in the upper
registers of her throat and wishing the director would come.
There was however such a wild beating of wings in the room that
she did not feel her position was more incongruous than any one
else's. In addition, her training told and after a series of
semi-military turns, shifts, and marches she found herself
presumably talking to a neat, slick girl with a lovely boy's
face, but actually absorbed by a conversation taking place on a
sort of gun-metal ladder diagonally opposite her and four feet
away.</p>

<p>There was a trio of young women sitting on the bench. They
were all tall and slender with small heads groomed like manikins'
heads, and as they talked the heads waved gracefully about above
their dark tailored suits, rather like long-stemmed flowers and
rather like cobras' hoods.</p>

<p>"Oh, they give a good show," said one of them, in a deep rich
voice. "Practically the best show in Paris&#151;I'd be the last one
to deny that. But after all&#151;" She sighed. "Those phrases he uses
over and over&#151;'Oldest inhabitant gnawed by rodents.' You laugh
once."</p>

<p>"I prefer people whose lives have more corrugated surfaces,"
said the second, "and I don't like her."</p>

<p>"I've never really been able to get very excited about them,
or their entourage either. Why, for example, the entirely liquid
Mr. North?"</p>

<p>"He's out," said the first girl. "But you must admit that the
party in question can be one of the most charming human beings
you have ever met."</p>

<p>It was the first hint Rosemary had had that they were talking
about the Divers, and her body grew tense with indignation. But
the girl talking to her, in the starched blue shirt with the
bright blue eyes and the red cheeks and the very gray suit, a
poster of a girl, had begun to play up. Desperately she kept
sweeping things from between them, afraid that Rosemary couldn't
see her, sweeping them away until presently there was not so much
as a veil of brittle humor hiding the girl, and with distaste
Rosemary saw her plain.</p>

<p>"Couldn't you have lunch, or maybe dinner, or lunch the day
after?" begged the girl. Rosemary looked about for Dick, finding
him with the hostess, to whom he had been talking since they came
in. Their eyes met and he nodded slightly, and simultaneously the
three cobra women noticed her; their long necks darted toward her
and they fixed finely critical glances upon her. She looked back
at them defiantly, acknowledging that she had heard what they
said. Then she threw off her exigent vis-à-vis with a
polite but clipped parting that she had just learned from Dick,
and went over to join him. The hostess&#151;she was another tall rich
American girl, promenading insouciantly upon the national
prosperity&#151;was asking Dick innumerable questions about Gausse's
Hôtel, whither she evidently wanted to come, and battering
persistently against his reluctance. Rosemary's presence reminded
her that she had been recalcitrant as a hostess and glancing
about she said: "Have you met any one amusing, have you met
Mr.&#151;" Her eyes groped for a male who might interest Rosemary,
but Dick said they must go. They left immediately, moving over
the brief threshold of the future to the sudden past of the stone
façade without.</p>

<p>"Wasn't it terrible?" he said.</p>

<p>"Terrible," she echoed obediently.</p>

<p>"Rosemary?"</p>

<p>She murmured, "What?" in an awed voice.</p>

<p>"I feel terribly about this."</p>

<p>She was shaken with audibly painful sobs. "Have you got a
handkerchief?" she faltered. But there was little time to cry,
and lovers now they fell ravenously on the quick seconds while
outside the taxi windows the green and cream twilight faded, and
the fire-red, gas-blue, ghost-green signs began to shine smokily
through the tranquil rain. It was nearly six, the streets were in
movement, the bistros gleamed, the Place de la Concorde moved by
in pink majesty as the cab turned north.</p>

<p>They looked at each other at last, murmuring names that were a
spell. Softly the two names lingered on the air, died away more
slowly than other words, other names, slower than music in the
mind.</p>

<p>"I don't know what came over me last night," Rosemary said.
"That glass of champagne? I've never done anything like that
before."</p>

<p>"You simply said you loved me."</p>

<p>"I do love you&#151;I can't change that." It was time for Rosemary
to cry, so she cried a little in her handkerchief.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I'm in love with you," said Dick, "and that's not
the best thing that could happen."</p>

<p>Again the names&#151;then they lurched together as if the taxi had
swung them. Her breasts crushed flat against him, her mouth was
all new and warm, owned in common. They stopped thinking with an
almost painful relief, stopped seeing; they only breathed and
sought each other. They were both in the gray gentle world of a
mild hangover of fatigue when the nerves relax in bunches like
piano strings, and crackle suddenly like wicker chairs. Nerves so
raw and tender must surely join other nerves, lips to lips,
breast to breast. . . .</p>

<p>They were still in the happier stage of love. They were full
of brave illusions about each other, tremendous illusions, so
that the communion of self with self seemed to be on a plane
where no other human relations mattered. They both seemed to have
arrived there with an extraordinary innocence as though a series
of pure accidents had driven them together, so many accidents
that at last they were forced to conclude that they were for each
other. They had arrived with clean hands, or so it seemed, after
no traffic with the merely curious and clandestine.</p>

<p>But for Dick that portion of the road was short; the turning
came before they reached the hotel.</p>

<p>"There's nothing to do about it," he said, with a feeling of
panic. "I'm in love with you but it doesn't change what I said
last night."</p>

<p>"That doesn't matter now. I just wanted to make you love
me&#151;if you love me everything's all right."</p>

<p>"Unfortunately I do. But Nicole mustn't know&#151;she mustn't
suspect even faintly. Nicole and I have got to go on together. In
a way that's more important than just wanting to go on."</p>

<p>"Kiss me once more."</p>

<p>He kissed her, but momentarily he had left her.</p>

<p>"Nicole mustn't suffer&#151;she loves me and I love her&#151;you
understand that."</p>

<p>She did understand&#151;it was the sort of thing she understood
well, not hurting people. She knew the Divers loved each other
because it had been her primary assumption. She had thought
however that it was a rather cooled relation, and actually rather
like the love of herself and her mother. When people have so much
for outsiders didn't it indicate a lack of inner intensity?</p>

<p>"And I mean love," he said, guessing her thoughts. "Active
love&#151;it's more complicated than I can tell you. It was
responsible for that crazy duel."</p>

<p>"How did you know about the duel? I thought we were to keep it
from you."</p>

<p>"Do you think Abe can keep a secret?" He spoke with incisive
irony. "Tell a secret over the radio, publish it in a tabloid,
but never tell it to a man who drinks more than three or four a
day."</p>

<p>She laughed in agreement, staying close to him.</p>

<p>"So you understand my relations with Nicole are complicated.
She's not very strong&#151;she looks strong but she isn't. And this
makes rather a mess."</p>

<p>"Oh, say that later! But kiss me now&#151;love me now. I'll love
you and never let Nicole see."</p>

<p>"You darling."</p>

<p>They reached the hotel and Rosemary walked a little behind
him, to admire him, to adore him. His step was alert as if he had
just come from some great doings and was hurrying on toward
others. Organizer of private gaiety, curator of a richly
incrusted happiness. His hat was a perfect hat and he carried a
heavy stick and yellow gloves. She thought what a good time they
would all have being with him to-night.</p>

<p>They walked upstairs&#151;five flights. At the first landing they
stopped and kissed; she was careful on the next landing, on the
third more careful still. On the next&#151;there were two more&#151;she
stopped half way and kissed him fleetingly good-by. At his
urgency she walked down with him to the one below for a
minute&#151;and then up and up. Finally it was good-by with their
hands stretching to touch along the diagonal of the banister and
then the fingers slipping apart. Dick went back downstairs to
make some arrangements for the evening&#151;Rosemary ran to her room
and wrote a letter to her mother; she was conscience-stricken
because she did not miss her mother at all.</p>
