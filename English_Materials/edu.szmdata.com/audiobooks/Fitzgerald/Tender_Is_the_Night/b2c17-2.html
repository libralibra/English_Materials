<p class="storyTitle">XVII</p>





<p>Tommy Barban was a ruler, Tommy was a hero&#151;Dick happened upon
him in the Marienplatz in Munich, in one of those cafés,
where small gamblers diced on "tapestry" mats. The air was full
of politics, and the slap of cards.</p>

<p>Tommy was at a table laughing his martial laugh:
"Um-buh&#151;ha-ha! Um-buh&#151;ha-ha!" As a rule, he drank little;
courage was his game and his companions were always a little
afraid of him. Recently an eighth of the area of his skull had
been removed by a Warsaw surgeon and was knitting under his hair,
and the weakest person in the café could have killed him
with a flip of a knotted napkin.</p>

<p>"&#151;this is Prince Chillicheff&#151;" A battered, powder-gray
Russian of fifty, "&#151;and Mr. McKibben&#151;and Mr. Hannan&#151;" the
latter was a lively ball of black eyes and hair, a clown; and he
said immediately to Dick:</p>

<p>"The first thing before we shake hands&#151;what do you mean by
fooling around with my aunt?"</p>

<p>"Why, I&#151;"</p>

<p>"You heard me. What are you doing here in Munich anyhow?"</p>

<p>"Um-bah&#151;ha-ha!" laughed Tommy.</p>

<p>"Haven't you got aunts of your own? Why don't you fool with
them?"</p>

<p>Dick laughed, whereupon the man shifted his attack:</p>

<p>"Now let's not have any more talk about aunts. How do I know
you didn't make up the whole thing? Here you are a complete
stranger with an acquaintance of less than half an hour, and you
come up to me with a cock-and-bull story about your aunts. How do
I know what you have concealed about you?"</p>

<p>Tommy laughed again, then he said good-naturedly, but firmly,
"That's enough, Carly. Sit down, Dick&#151;how're you? How's
Nicole?"</p>

<p>He did not like any man very much nor feel their presence with
much intensity&#151;he was all relaxed for combat; as a fine athlete
playing secondary defense in any sport is really resting much of
the time, while a lesser man only pretends to rest and is at a
continual and self-destroying nervous tension.</p>

<p>Hannan, not entirely suppressed, moved to an adjoining piano,
and with recurring resentment on his face whenever he looked at
Dick, played chords, from time to time muttering, "Your aunts,"
and, in a dying cadence, "I didn't say aunts anyhow. I said
pants."</p>

<p>"Well, how're you?" repeated Tommy. "You don't look so&#151;" he
fought for a word, "&#151;so jaunty as you used to, so spruce, you
know what I mean."</p>

<p>The remark sounded too much like one of those irritating
accusations of waning vitality and Dick was about to retort by
commenting on the extraordinary suits worn by Tommy and Prince
Chillicheff, suits of a cut and pattern fantastic enough to have
sauntered down Beale Street on a Sunday&#151;when an explanation was
forthcoming.</p>

<p>"I see you are regarding our clothes," said the Prince. "We
have just come out of Russia."</p>

<p>"These were made in Poland by the court tailor," said Tommy.
"That's a fact&#151;Pilsudski's own tailor."</p>

<p>"You've been touring?" Dick asked.</p>

<p>They laughed, the Prince inordinately meanwhile clapping Tommy
on the back.</p>

<p>"Yes, we have been touring. That's it, touring. We have made
the grand Tour of all the Russias. In state."</p>

<p>Dick waited for an explanation. It came from Mr. McKibben in
two words.</p>

<p>"They escaped."</p>

<p>"Have you been prisoners in Russia?"</p>

<p>"It was I," explained Prince Chillicheff, his dead yellow eyes
staring at Dick. "Not a prisoner but in hiding."</p>

<p>"Did you have much trouble getting out?"</p>

<p>"Some trouble. We left three Red Guards dead at the border.
Tommy left two&#151;" He held up two fingers like a Frenchman&#151;"I
left one."</p>

<p>"That's the part I don't understand," said Mr. McKibben. "Why
they should have objected to your leaving."</p>

<p>Hannan turned from the piano and said, winking at the others:
"Mac thinks a Marxian is somebody who went to St. Mark's
school."</p>

<p>It was an escape story in the best tradition&#151;an aristocrat
hiding nine years with a former servant and working in a
government bakery; the eighteen-year-old daughter in Paris who
knew Tommy Barban. . . . During the narrative Dick decided that
this parched papier mâché relic of the past was
scarcely worth the lives of three young men. The question arose
as to whether Tommy and Chillicheff had been frightened.</p>

<p>"When I was cold," Tommy said. "I always get scared when I'm
cold. During the war I was always frightened when I was
cold."</p>

<p>McKibben stood up.</p>

<p>"I must leave. To-morrow morning I'm going to Innsbruck by car
with my wife and children&#151;and the governess."</p>

<p>"I'm going there to-morrow, too," said Dick.</p>

<p>"Oh, are you?" exclaimed McKibben. "Why not come with us? It's
a big Packard and there's only my wife and my children and
myself&#151;and the governess&#151;"</p>

<p>"I can't possibly&#151;"</p>

<p>"Of course she's not really a governess," McKibben concluded,
looking rather pathetically at Dick. "As a matter of fact my wife
knows your sister-in-law, Baby Warren."</p>

<p>But Dick was not to be drawn in a blind contract.</p>

<p>"I've promised to travel with two men."</p>

<p>"Oh," McKibben's face fell. "Well, I'll say good-by." He
unscrewed two blooded wire-hairs from a nearby table and
departed; Dick pictured the jammed Packard pounding toward
Innsbruck with the McKibbens and their children and their baggage
and yapping dogs&#151;and the governess.</p>

<p>"The paper says they know the man who killed him," said Tommy.
"But his cousins did not want it in the papers, because it
happened in a speakeasy. What do you think of that?"</p>

<p>"It's what's known as family pride."</p>

<p>Hannan played a loud chord on the piano to attract attention
to himself.</p>

<p>"I don't believe his first stuff holds up," he said. "Even
barring the Europeans there are a dozen Americans can do what
North did."</p>

<p>It was the first indication Dick had had that they were
talking about Abe North.</p>

<p>"The only difference is that Abe did it first," said
Tommy.</p>

<p>"I don't agree," persisted Hannan. "He got the reputation for
being a good musician because he drank so much that his friends
had to explain him away somehow&#151;"</p>

<p>"What's this about Abe North? What about him? Is he in a
jam?"</p>

<p>"Didn't you read The Herald this morning?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"He's dead. He was beaten to death in a speakeasy in New York.
He just managed to crawl home to the Racquet Club to die&#151;"</p>

<p><i>"Abe North?"</i></p>

<p>"Yes, sure, they&#151;"</p>

<p><i>"Abe North?"</i> Dick stood up. "Are you sure he's
dead?"</p>

<p>Hannan turned around to McKibben: "It wasn't the Racquet Club
he crawled to&#151;it was the Harvard Club. I'm sure he didn't belong
to the Racquet."</p>

<p>"The paper said so," McKibben insisted.</p>

<p>"It must have been a mistake. I'm quite sure."</p>

<p><i>"Beaten to death in a speakeasy."</i></p>

<p>"But I happen to know most of the members of the Racquet
Club," said Hannan. "It <i>must</i> have been the Harvard
Club."</p>

<p>Dick got up, Tommy too. Prince Chillicheff started out of a
wan study of nothing, perhaps of his chances of ever getting out
of Russia, a study that had occupied him so long that it was
doubtful if he could give it up immediately, and joined them in
leaving.</p>

<p><i>"Abe North beaten to death."</i></p>

<p>On the way to the hotel, a journey of which Dick was scarcely
aware, Tommy said:</p>

<p>"We're waiting for a tailor to finish some suits so we can get
to Paris. I'm going into stock-broking and they wouldn't take me
if I showed up like this. Everybody in your country is making
millions. Are you really leaving to-morrow? We can't even have
dinner with you. It seems the Prince had an old girl in Munich.
He called her up but she'd been dead five years and we're having
dinner with the two daughters."</p>

<p>The Prince nodded.</p>

<p>"Perhaps I could have arranged for Doctor Diver."</p>

<p>"No, no," said Dick hastily.</p>

<p>He slept deep and awoke to a slow mournful march passing his
window. It was a long column of men in uniform, wearing the
familiar helmet of 1914, thick men in frock coats and silk hats,
burghers, aristocrats, plain men. It was a society of veterans
going to lay wreaths on the tombs of the dead. The column marched
slowly with a sort of swagger for a lost magnificence, a past
effort, a forgotten sorrow. The faces were only formally sad but
Dick's lungs burst for a moment with regret for Abe's death, and
his own youth of ten years ago.</p>
