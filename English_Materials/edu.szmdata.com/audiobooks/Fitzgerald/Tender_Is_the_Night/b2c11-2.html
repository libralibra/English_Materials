<p class="storyTitle">XI</p>





<p>Doctor Richard Diver and Mrs. Elsie Speers sat in the
Café des Alliées in August, under cool and dusty
trees. The sparkle of the mica was dulled by the baked ground,
and a few gusts of mistral from down the coast seeped through the
Esterel and rocked the fishing boats in the harbor, pointing the
masts here and there at a featureless sky.</p>

<p>"I had a letter this morning," said Mrs. Speers. "What a
terrible time you all must have had with those Negroes! But
Rosemary said you were perfectly wonderful to her."</p>

<p>"Rosemary ought to have a service stripe. It was pretty
harrowing&#151;the only person it didn't disturb was Abe North&#151;he
flew off to Havre&#151;he probably doesn't know about it yet."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry Mrs. Diver was upset," she said carefully.</p>

<p>Rosemary had written:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Nicole seemed Out of her Mind. I didn't want to come South
with them because I felt Dick had enough on his hands.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>"She's all right now." He spoke almost impatiently. "So you're
leaving to-morrow. When will you sail?"</p>

<p>"Right away."</p>

<p>"My God, it's awful to have you go."</p>

<p>"We're glad we came here. We've had a good time, thanks to
you. You're the first man Rosemary ever cared for."</p>

<p>Another gust of wind strained around the porphyry hills of la
Napoule. There was a hint in the air that the earth was hurrying
on toward other weather; the lush midsummer moment outside of
time was already over.</p>

<p>"Rosemary's had crushes but sooner or later she always turned
the man over to me&#151;" Mrs. Speers laughed, "&#151;for
dissection."</p>

<p>"So I was spared."</p>

<p>"There was nothing I could have done. She was in love with you
before I ever saw you. I told her to go ahead."</p>

<p>He saw that no provision had been made for him, or for Nicole,
in Mrs. Speers' plans&#151;and he saw that her amorality sprang from
the conditions of her own withdrawal. It was her right, the
pension on which her own emotions had retired. Women are
necessarily capable of almost anything in their struggle for
survival and can scarcely be convicted of such man-made crimes as
"cruelty." So long as the shuffle of love and pain went on within
proper walls Mrs. Speers could view it with as much detachment
and humor as a eunuch. She had not even allowed for the
possibility of Rosemary's being damaged&#151;or was she certain that
she couldn't be?</p>

<p>"If what you say is true I don't think it did her any harm."
He was keeping up to the end the pretense that he could still
think objectively about Rosemary. "She's over it already.
Still&#151;so many of the important times in life begin by seeming
incidental."</p>

<p>"This wasn't incidental," Mrs. Speers insisted. "You were the
first man&#151;you're an ideal to her. In every letter she says
that."</p>

<p>"She's so polite."</p>

<p>"You and Rosemary are the politest people I've ever known, but
she means this."</p>

<p>"My politeness is a trick of the heart."</p>

<p>This was partly true. From his father Dick had learned the
somewhat conscious good manners of the young Southerner coming
north after the Civil War. Often he used them and just as often
he despised them because they were not a protest against how
unpleasant selfishness was but against how unpleasant it
looked.</p>

<p>"I'm in love with Rosemary," he told her suddenly. "It's a
kind of self-indulgence saying that to you."</p>

<p>It seemed very strange and official to him, as if the very
tables and chairs in the Café des Alliées would
remember it forever. Already he felt her absence from these
skies: on the beach he could only remember the sun-torn flesh of
her shoulder; at Tarmes he crushed out her footprints as he
crossed the garden; and now the orchestra launching into the Nice
Carnival Song, an echo of last year's vanished gaieties, started
the little dance that went on all about her. In a hundred hours
she had come to possess all the world's dark magic; the blinding
belladonna, the caffein converting physical into nervous energy,
the mandragora that imposes harmony.</p>

<p>With an effort he once more accepted the fiction that he
shared Mrs. Speers' detachment.</p>

<p>"You and Rosemary aren't really alike," he said. "The wisdom
she got from you is all molded up into her persona, into the mask
she faces the world with. She doesn't think; her real depths are
Irish and romantic and illogical."</p>

<p>Mrs. Speers knew too that Rosemary, for all her delicate
surface, was a young mustang, perceptibly by Captain Doctor Hoyt,
U.S.A. Cross-sectioned, Rosemary would have displayed an enormous
heart, liver and soul, all crammed close together under the
lovely shell.</p>

<p>Saying good-by, Dick was aware of Elsie Speers' full charm,
aware that she meant rather more to him than merely a last
unwillingly relinquished fragment of Rosemary. He could possibly
have made up Rosemary&#151;he could never have made up her mother. If
the cloak, spurs and brilliants in which Rosemary had walked off
were things with which he had endowed her, it was nice in
contrast to watch her mother's grace knowing it was surely
something he had not evoked. She had an air of seeming to wait,
as if for a man to get through with something more important than
herself, a battle or an operation, during which he must not be
hurried or interfered with. When the man had finished she would
be waiting, without fret or impatience, somewhere on a highstool,
turning the pages of a newspaper.</p>

<p>"Good-by&#151;and I want you both to remember always how fond of
you Nicole and I have grown."</p>

<p>Back at the Villa Diana, he went to his work-room, and opened
the shutters, closed against the mid-day glare. On his two long
tables, in ordered confusion, lay the materials of his book.
Volume I, concerned with Classification, had achieved some
success in a small subsidized edition. He was negotiating for its
reissue. Volume II was to be a great amplification of his first
little book, <i>A Psychology for Psychiatrists.</i> Like so many
men he had found that he had only one or two ideas&#151;that his
little collection of pamphlets now in its fiftieth German edition
contained the germ of all he would ever think or know.</p>

<p>But he was currently uneasy about the whole thing. He resented
the wasted years at New Haven, but mostly he felt a discrepancy
between the growing luxury in which the Divers lived, and the
need for display which apparently went along with it. Remembering
his Rumanian friend's story, about the man who had worked for
years on the brain of an armadillo, he suspected that patient
Germans were sitting close to the libraries of Berlin and Vienna
callously anticipating him. He had about decided to brief the
work in its present condition and publish it in an undocumented
volume of a hundred thousand words as an introduction to more
scholarly volumes to follow.</p>

<p>He confirmed this decision walking around the rays of late
afternoon in his work-room. With the new plan he could be through
by spring. It seemed to him that when a man with his energy was
pursued for a year by increasing doubts, it indicated some fault
in the plan.</p>

<p>He laid the bars of gilded metal that he used as paperweights
along the sheaves of notes. He swept up, for no servant was
allowed in here, treated his washroom sketchily with Bon Ami,
repaired a screen and sent off an order to a publishing house in
Zurich. Then he drank an ounce of gin with twice as much
water.</p>

<p>He saw Nicole in the garden. Presently he must encounter her
and the prospect gave him a leaden feeling. Before her he must
keep up a perfect front, now and to-morrow, next week and next
year. All night in Paris he had held her in his arms while she
slept light under the luminol; in the early morning he broke in
upon her confusion before it could form, with words of tenderness
and protection, and she slept again with his face against the
warm scent of her hair. Before she woke he had arranged
everything at the phone in the next room. Rosemary was to move to
another hotel. She was to be "Daddy's Girl" and even to give up
saying good-by to them. The proprietor of the hotel, Mr. McBeth,
was to be the three Chinese monkeys. Packing amid the piled boxes
and tissue paper of many purchases, Dick and Nicole left for the
Riviera at noon.</p>

<p>Then there was a reaction. As they settled down in the
wagon-lit Dick saw that Nicole was waiting for it, and it came
quickly and desperately, before the train was out of the
ceinture&#151;his only instinct was to step off while the train was
still going slow, rush back and see where Rosemary was, what she
was doing. He opened a book and bent his pince-nez upon it, aware
that Nicole was watching him from her pillow across the
compartment. Unable to read, he pretended to be tired and shut
his eyes but she was still watching him, and though still she was
half asleep from the hangover of the drug, she was relieved and
almost happy that he was hers again.</p>

<p>It was worse with his eyes shut for it gave a rhythm of
finding and losing, finding and losing; but so as not to appear
restless he lay like that until noon. At luncheon things were
better&#151;it was always a fine meal; a thousand lunches in inns and
restaurants, wagon-lits, buffets, and aeroplanes were a mighty
collation to have taken together. The familiar hurry of the train
waiters, the little bottles of wine and mineral water, the
excellent food of the Paris-Lyons-Méditerranee gave them
the illusion that everything was the same as before, but it was
almost the first trip he had ever taken with Nicole that was a
going away rather than a going toward. He drank a whole bottle of
wine save for Nicole's single glass; they talked about the house
and the children. But once back in the compartment a silence fell
over them like the silence in the restaurant across from the
Luxembourg. Receding from a grief, it seems necessary to retrace
the same steps that brought us there. An unfamiliar impatience
settled on Dick; suddenly Nicole said:</p>

<p>"It seemed too bad to leave Rosemary like that&#151;do you suppose
she'll be all right?"</p>

<p>"Of course. She could take care of herself anywhere&#151;" Lest
this belittle Nicole's ability to do likewise, he added, "After
all, she's an actress, and even though her mother's in the
background she <i>has</i> to look out for herself."</p>

<p>"She's very attractive."</p>

<p>"She's an infant."</p>

<p>"She's attractive though."</p>

<p>They talked aimlessly back and forth, each speaking for the
other.</p>

<p>"She's not as intelligent as I thought," Dick offered.</p>

<p>"She's quite smart."</p>

<p>"Not very, though&#151;there's a persistent aroma of the
nursery."</p>

<p>"She's very&#151;very pretty," Nicole said in a detached, emphatic
way, "and I thought she was very good in the picture."</p>

<p>"She was well directed. Thinking it over, it wasn't very
individual."</p>

<p>"I thought it was. I can see how she'd be very attractive to
men."</p>

<p>His heart twisted. To what men? How many men?</p>

<p>&#151;Do you mind if I pull down the curtain?</p>

<p>&#151;Please do, it's too light in here.</p>

<p>Where now? And with whom?</p>

<p>"In a few years she'll look ten years older than you."</p>

<p>"On the contrary. I sketched her one night on a theatre
program, I think she'll last."</p>

<p>They were both restless in the night. In a day or two Dick
would try to banish the ghost of Rosemary before it became walled
up with them, but for the moment he had no force to do it.
Sometimes it is harder to deprive oneself of a pain than of a
pleasure and the memory so possessed him that for the moment
there was nothing to do but to pretend. This was more difficult
because he was currently annoyed with Nicole, who, after all
these years, should recognize symptoms of strain in herself and
guard against them. Twice within a fortnight she had broken up:
there had been the night of the dinner at Tarmes when he had
found her in her bedroom dissolved in crazy laughter telling Mrs.
McKisco she could not go in the bathroom because the key was
thrown down the well. Mrs. McKisco was astonished and resentful,
baffled and yet in a way comprehending. Dick had not been
particularly alarmed then, for afterward Nicole was repentant.
She called at Gausse's Hotel but the McKiscos were gone.</p>

<p>The collapse in Paris was another matter, adding significance
to the first one. It prophesied possibly a new cycle, a new
pousse of the malady. Having gone through unprofessional agonies
during her long relapse following Topsy's birth, he had,
perforce, hardened himself about her, making a cleavage between
Nicole sick and Nicole well. This made it difficult now to
distinguish between his self-protective professional detachment
and some new coldness in his heart. As an indifference cherished,
or left to atrophy, becomes an emptiness, to this extent he had
learned to become empty of Nicole, serving her against his will
with negations and emotional neglect. One writes of scars healed,
a loose parallel to the pathology of the skin, but there is no
such thing in the life of an individual. There are open wounds,
shrunk sometimes to the size of a pin-prick but wounds still. The
marks of suffering are more comparable to the loss of a finger,
or of the sight of an eye. We may not miss them, either, for one
minute in a year, but if we should there is nothing to be done
about it.</p>
