<p class="storyTitle">II</p>





<p>Dick told Nicole an expurgated version of the catastrophe in
Rome&#151;in his version he had gone philanthropically to the rescue
of a drunken friend. He could trust Baby Warren to hold her
tongue, since he had painted the disastrous effect of the truth
upon Nicole. All this, however, was a low hurdle compared to the
lingering effect of the episode upon him.</p>

<p>In reaction he took himself for an intensified beating in his
work, so that Franz, trying to break with him, could find no
basis on which to begin a disagreement. No friendship worth the
name was ever destroyed in an hour without some painful flesh
being torn&#151;so Franz let himself believe with ever-increasing
conviction that Dick travelled intellectually and emotionally at
such a rate of speed that the vibrations jarred him&#151;this was a
contrast that had previously been considered a virtue in their
relation. So, for the shoddiness of needs, are shoes made out of
last year's hide.</p>

<p>Yet it was May before Franz found an opportunity to insert the
first wedge. Dick came into his office white and tired one noon
and sat down, saying:</p>

<p>"Well, she's gone."</p>

<p>"She's dead?"</p>

<p>"The heart quit."</p>

<p>Dick sat exhausted in the chair nearest the door. During three
nights he had remained with the scabbed anonymous woman-artist he
had come to love, formally to portion out the adrenaline, but
really to throw as much wan light as he could into the darkness
ahead.</p>

<p>Half appreciating his feeling, Franz travelled quickly over an
opinion:</p>

<p>"It was neuro-syphilis. All the Wassermans we took won't tell
me differently. The spinal fluid&#151;"</p>

<p>"Never mind," said Dick. "Oh, God, never mind! If she cared
enough about her secret to take it away with her, let it go at
that."</p>

<p>"You better lay off for a day."</p>

<p>"Don't worry, I'm going to."</p>

<p>Franz had his wedge; looking up from the telegram that he was
writing to the woman's brother he inquired: "Or do you want to
take a little trip?"</p>

<p>"Not now."</p>

<p>"I don't mean a vacation. There's a case in Lausanne. I've
been on the phone with a Chilian all morning&#151;"</p>

<p>"She was so damn brave," said Dick. "And it took her so long."
Franz shook his head sympathetically and Dick got himself
together. "Excuse me for interrupting you."</p>

<p>"This is just a change&#151;the situation is a father's problem
with his son&#151;the father can't get the son up here. He wants
somebody to come down there."</p>

<p>"What is it? Alcoholism? Homosexuality? When you say
Lausanne&#151;"</p>

<p>"A little of everything."</p>

<p>"I'll go down. Is there any money in it?"</p>

<p>"Quite a lot, I'd say. Count on staying two or three days, and
get the boy up here if he needs to be watched. In any case take
your time, take your ease; combine business with pleasure."</p>

<p>After two hours' train sleep Dick felt renewed, and he
approached the interview with Señor Pardo y Cuidad Real in
good spirits.</p>

<p>These interviews were much of a type. Often the sheer hysteria
of the family representative was as interesting psychologically
as the condition of the patient. This one was no exception:
Señor Pardo y Cuidad Real, a handsome iron-gray Spaniard,
noble of carriage, with all the appurtenances of wealth and
power, raged up and down his suite in the Hôtel de Trois
Mondes and told the story of his son with no more self-control
than a drunken woman.</p>

<p>"I am at the end of my invention. My son is corrupt. He was
corrupt at Harrow, he was corrupt at King's College, Cambridge.
He's incorrigibly corrupt. Now that there is this drinking it is
more and more obvious how he is, and there is continual scandal.
I have tried everything&#151;I worked out a plan with a doctor friend
of mine, sent them together for a tour of Spain. Every evening
Francisco had an injection of cantharides and then the two went
together to a reputable bordello&#151;for a week or so it seemed to
work but the result was nothing. Finally last week in this very
room, rather in that bathroom&#151;" he pointed at it, "&#151;I made
Francisco strip to the waist and lashed him with a whip&#151;"</p>

<p>Exhausted with his emotion he sat down and Dick spoke:</p>

<p>"That was foolish&#151;the trip to Spain was futile also&#151;" He
struggled against an upsurging hilarity&#151;that any reputable
medical man should have lent himself to such an amateurish
experiment! "&#151;Señor, I must tell you that in these cases
we can promise nothing. In the case of the drinking we can often
accomplish something&#151;with proper co-operation. The first thing
is to see the boy and get enough of his confidence to find
whether he has any insight into the matter."</p>

<p>&#151;The boy, with whom he sat on the terrace, was about twenty,
handsome and alert.</p>

<p>"I'd like to know your attitude," Dick said. "Do you feel that
the situation is getting worse? And do you want to do anything
about it?"</p>

<p>"I suppose I do," said Francisco, "I am very unhappy."</p>

<p>"Do you think it's from the drinking or from the
abnormality?"</p>

<p>"I think the drinking is caused by the other." He was serious
for a while&#151;suddenly an irrepressible facetiousness broke
through and he laughed, saying, "It's hopeless. At King's I was
known as the Queen of Chili. That trip to Spain&#151;all it did was
to make me nauseated by the sight of a woman."</p>

<p>Dick caught him up sharply.</p>

<p>"If you're happy in this mess, then I can't help you and I'm
wasting my time."</p>

<p>"No, let's talk&#151;I despise most of the others so." There was
some manliness in the boy, perverted now into an active
resistance to his father. But he had that typically roguish look
in his eyes that homosexuals assume in discussing the
subject.</p>

<p>"It's a hole-and-corner business at best," Dick told him.
"You'll spend your life on it, and its consequences, and you
won't have time or energy for any other decent or social act. If
you want to face the world you'll have to begin by controlling
your sensuality&#151;and, first of all, the drinking that provokes
it&#151;"</p>

<p>He talked automatically, having abandoned the case ten minutes
before. They talked pleasantly through another hour about the
boy's home in Chili and about his ambitions. It was as close as
Dick had ever come to comprehending such a character from any but
the pathological angle&#151;he gathered that this very charm made it
possible for Francisco to perpetrate his outrages, and, for Dick,
charm always had an independent existence, whether it was the mad
gallantry of the wretch who had died in the clinic this morning,
or the courageous grace which this lost young man brought to a
drab old story. Dick tried to dissect it into pieces small enough
to store away&#151;realizing that the totality of a life may be
different in quality from its segments, and also that life during
the forties seemed capable of being observed only in segments.
His love for Nicole and Rosemary, his friendship with Abe North,
with Tommy Barban in the broken universe of the war's ending&#151;in
such contacts the personalities had seemed to press up so close
to him that he became the personality itself&#151;there seemed some
necessity of taking all or nothing; it was as if for the
remainder of his life he was condemned to carry with him the egos
of certain people, early met and early loved, and to be only as
complete as they were complete themselves. There was some element
of loneliness involved&#151;so easy to be loved&#151;so hard to love.</p>

<p>As he sat on the veranda with young Francisco, a ghost of the
past swam into his ken. A tall, singularly swaying male detached
himself from the shrubbery and approached Dick and Francisco with
feeble resolution. For a moment he formed such an apologetic part
of the vibrant landscape that Dick scarcely remarked him&#151;then
Dick was on his feet, shaking hands with an abstracted air,
thinking, "My God, I've stirred up a nest!" and trying to collect
the man's name.</p>

<p>"This is Doctor Diver, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Well, well&#151;Mr. Dumphry, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Royal Dumphry. I had the pleasure of having dinner one night
in that lovely garden of yours."</p>

<p>"Of course." Trying to dampen Mr. Dumphry's enthusiasm, Dick
went into impersonal chronology. "It was in
nineteen&#151;twenty-four&#151;or twenty-five&#151;"</p>

<p>He had remained standing, but Royal Dumphry, shy as he had
seemed at first, was no laggard with his pick and spade; he spoke
to Francisco in a flip, intimate manner, but the latter, ashamed
of him, joined Dick in trying to freeze him away.</p>

<p>"Doctor Diver&#151;one thing I want to say before you go. I've
never forgotten that evening in your garden&#151;how nice you and
your wife were. To me it's one of the finest memories in my life,
one of the happiest ones. I've always thought of it as the most
civilized gathering of people that I have ever known."</p>

<p>Dick continued a crab-like retreat toward the nearest door of
the hotel.</p>

<p>"I'm glad you remembered it so pleasantly. Now I've got to
see&#151;"</p>

<p>"I understand," Royal Dumphry pursued sympathetically. "I hear
he's dying."</p>

<p>"Who's dying?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps I shouldn't have said that&#151;but we have the same
physician."</p>

<p>Dick paused, regarding him in astonishment. "Who're you
talking about?"</p>

<p>"Why, your wife's father&#151;perhaps I&#151;"</p>

<p>"My <i>what</i>?"</p>

<p>"I suppose&#151;you mean I'm the first person&#151;"</p>

<p>"You mean my wife's father is here, in Lausanne?"</p>

<p>"Why, I thought you knew&#151;I thought that was why you were
here."</p>

<p>"What doctor is taking care of him?"</p>

<p>Dick scrawled the name in a notebook, excused himself, and
hurried to a telephone booth.</p>

<p>It was convenient for Doctor Dangeu to see Doctor Diver at his
house immediately.</p>

<p>Doctor Dangeu was a young Génevois; for a moment he was
afraid that he was going to lose a profitable patient, but, when
Dick reassured him, he divulged the fact that Mr. Warren was
indeed dying.</p>

<p>"He is only fifty but the liver has stopped restoring itself;
the precipitating factor is alcoholism."</p>

<p>"Doesn't respond?"</p>

<p>"The man can take nothing except liquids&#151;I give him three
days, or at most, a week."</p>

<p>"Does his elder daughter, Miss Warren, know his
condition?"</p>

<p>"By his own wish no one knows except the man-servant. It was
only this morning I felt I had to tell him&#151;he took it excitedly,
although he has been in a very religious and resigned mood from
the beginning of his illness."</p>

<p>Dick considered: "Well&#151;" he decided slowly, "in any case I'll
take care of the family angle. But I imagine they would want a
consultation."</p>

<p>"As you like."</p>

<p>"I know I speak for them when I ask you to call in one of the
best-known medicine men around the lake&#151;Herbrugge, from
Geneva."</p>

<p>"I was thinking of Herbrugge."</p>

<p>"Meanwhile I'm here for a day at least and I'll keep in touch
with you."</p>

<p>That evening Dick went to Señor Pardo y Cuidad Real and
they talked.</p>

<p>"We have large estates in Chili&#151;" said the old man. "My son
could well be taking care of them. Or I can get him in any one of
a dozen enterprises in Paris&#151;" He shook his head and paced
across the windows against a spring rain so cheerful that it
didn't even drive the swans to cover, "My only son! Can't you
take him with you?"</p>

<p>The Spaniard knelt suddenly at Dick's feet.</p>

<p>"Can't you cure my only son? I believe in you&#151;you can take
him with you, cure him."</p>

<p>"It's impossible to commit a person on such grounds. I
wouldn't if I could."</p>

<p>The Spaniard got up from his knees.</p>

<p>"I have been hasty&#151;I have been driven&#151;"</p>

<p>Descending to the lobby Dick met Doctor Dangeu in the
elevator.</p>

<p>"I was about to call your room," the latter said. "Can we
speak out on the terrace?"</p>

<p>"Is Mr. Warren dead?" Dick demanded.</p>

<p>"He is the same&#151;the consultation is in the morning. Meanwhile
he wants to see his daughter&#151;your wife&#151;with the greatest
fervor. It seems there was some quarrel&#151;"</p>

<p>"I know all about that."</p>

<p>The doctors looked at each other, thinking.</p>

<p>"Why don't you talk to him before you make up your mind?"
Dangeu suggested. "His death will be graceful&#151;merely a weakening
and sinking."</p>

<p>With an effort Dick consented.</p>

<p>"All right."</p>

<p>The suite in which Devereux Warren was gracefully weakening
and sinking was of the same size as that of the Señor
Pardo y Cuidad Real&#151;throughout this hotel there were many
chambers wherein rich ruins, fugitives from justice, claimants to
the thrones of mediatized principalities, lived on the
derivatives of opium or barbitol listening eternally as to an
inescapable radio, to the coarse melodies of old sins. This
corner of Europe does not so much draw people as accept them
without inconvenient questions. Routes cross here&#151;people bound
for private sanitariums or tuberculosis resorts in the mountains,
people who are no longer <i>persona gratis</i> in France or
Italy.</p>

<p>The suite was darkened. A nun with a holy face was nursing the
man whose emaciated fingers stirred a rosary on the white sheet.
He was still handsome and his voice summoned up a thick burr of
individuality as he spoke to Dick, after Dangeu had left them
together.</p>

<p>"We get a lot of understanding at the end of life. Only now,
Doctor Diver, do I realize what it was all about."</p>

<p>Dick waited.</p>

<p>"I've been a bad man. You must know how little right I have to
see Nicole again, yet a Bigger Man than either of us says to
forgive and to pity." The rosary slipped from his weak hands and
slid off the smooth bed covers. Dick picked it up for him. "If I
could see Nicole for ten minutes I would go happy out of the
world."</p>

<p>"It's not a decision I can make for myself," said Dick.
"Nicole is not strong." He made his decision but pretended to
hesitate. "I can put it up to my professional associate."</p>

<p>"What your associate says goes with me&#151;very well, Doctor. Let
me tell you my debt to you is so large&#151;"</p>

<p>Dick stood up quickly.</p>

<p>"I'll let you know the result through Doctor Dangeu."</p>

<p>In his room he called the clinic on the Zugersee. After a long
time Kaethe answered from her own house.</p>

<p>"I want to get in touch with Franz."</p>

<p>"Franz is up on the mountain. I'm going up myself&#151;is it
something I can tell him, Dick?"</p>

<p>"It's about Nicole&#151;her father is dying here in Lausanne. Tell
Franz that, to show him it's important; and ask him to phone me
from up there."</p>

<p>"I will."</p>

<p>"Tell him I'll be in my room here at the hotel from three to
five, and again from seven to eight, and after that to page me in
the dining-room."</p>

<p>In plotting these hours he forgot to add that Nicole was not
to be told; when he remembered it he was talking into a dead
telephone. Certainly Kaethe should realize.</p>

<p>. . . Kaethe had no exact intention of telling Nicole about
the call when she rode up the deserted hill of mountain
wild-flowers and secret winds, where the patients were taken to
ski in winter and to climb in spring. Getting off the train she
saw Nicole shepherding the children through some organized romp.
Approaching, she drew her arm gently along Nicole's shoulder,
saying: "You are clever with children&#151;you must teach them more
about swimming in the summer."</p>

<p>In the play they had grown hot, and Nicole's reflex in drawing
away from Kaethe's arm was automatic to the point of rudeness.
Kaethe's hand fell awkwardly into space, and then she too
reacted, verbally, and deplorably.</p>

<p>"Did you think I was going to embrace you?" she demanded
sharply. "It was only about Dick, I talked on the phone to him
and I was sorry&#151;"</p>

<p>"Is anything the matter with Dick?"</p>

<p>Kaethe suddenly realized her error, but she had taken a
tactless course and there was no choice but to answer as Nicole
pursued her with reiterated questions: ". . . then why were you
sorry?"</p>

<p>"Nothing about Dick. I must talk to Franz."</p>

<p>"It is about Dick."</p>

<p>There was terror in her face and collaborating alarm in the
faces of the Diver children, near at hand. Kaethe collapsed with:
"Your father is ill in Lausanne&#151;Dick wants to talk to Franz
about it."</p>

<p>"Is he very sick?" Nicole demanded&#151;just as Franz came up with
his hearty hospital manner. Gratefully Kaethe passed the remnant
of the buck to him&#151;but the damage was done.</p>

<p>"I'm going to Lausanne," announced Nicole.</p>

<p>"One minute," said Franz. "I'm not sure it's advisable. I must
first talk on the phone to Dick."</p>

<p>"Then I'll miss the train down," Nicole protested, "and then
I'll miss the three o'clock from Zurich! If my father is dying I
must&#151;" She left this in the air, afraid to formulate it. "I
<i>must</i> go. I'll have to run for the train." She was running
even as she spoke toward the sequence of flat cars that crowned
the bare hill with bursting steam and sound. Over her shoulder
she called back, "If you phone Dick tell him I'm coming, Franz!"
. . .</p>

<p>. . . Dick was in his own room in the hotel reading The New
York Herald when the swallow-like nun rushed in&#151;simultaneously
the phone rang.</p>

<p>"Is he dead?" Dick demanded of the nun, hopefully.</p>

<p>"Monsieur, il est parti&#151;he has gone away."</p>

<p>"Com<i>ment</i>?"</p>

<p>"Il est parti&#151;his man and his baggage have gone away
too!"</p>

<p>It was incredible. A man in that condition to arise and
depart.</p>

<p>Dick answered the phone-call from Franz. "You shouldn't have
told Nicole," he protested.</p>

<p>"Kaethe told her, very unwisely."</p>

<p>"I suppose it was my fault. Never tell a thing to a woman till
it's done. However, I'll meet Nicole . . . say, Franz, the
craziest thing has happened down here&#151;the old boy took up his
bed and walked. . . ."</p>

<p>"At what? What did you say?"</p>

<p>"I say he walked, old Warren&#151;he walked!"</p>

<p>"But why not?"</p>

<p>"He was supposed to be dying of general collapse . . . he got
up and walked away, back to Chicago, I guess. . . . I don't know,
the nurse is here now. . . . I don't know, Franz&#151;I've just heard
about it. . . . Call me later."</p>

<p>He spent the better part of two hours tracing Warren's
movements. The patient had found an opportunity between the
change of day and night nurses to resort to the bar where he had
gulped down four whiskeys; he paid his hotel bill with a thousand
dollar note, instructing the desk that the change should be sent
after him, and departed, presumably for America. A last minute
dash by Dick and Dangeu to overtake him at the station resulted
only in Dick's failing to meet Nicole; when they did meet in the
lobby of the hotel she seemed suddenly tired, and there was a
tight purse to her lips that disquieted him.</p>

<p>"How's father?" she demanded.</p>

<p>"He's much better. He seemed to have a good deal of reserve
energy after all." He hesitated, breaking it to her easy. "In
fact he got up and went away."</p>

<p>Wanting a drink, for the chase had occupied the dinner hour,
he led her, puzzled, toward the grill, and continued as they
occupied two leather easy-chairs and ordered a high-ball and a
glass of beer: "The man who was taking care of him made a wrong
prognosis or something&#151;wait a minute, I've hardly had time to
think the thing out myself."</p>

<p>"He's <i>gone?"</i></p>

<p>"He got the evening train for Paris."</p>

<p>They sat silent. From Nicole flowed a vast tragic apathy.</p>

<p>"It was instinct," Dick said, finally. "He was really dying,
but he tried to get a resumption of rhythm&#151;he's not the first
person that ever walked off his death-bed&#151;like an old clock&#151;you
know, you shake it and somehow from sheer habit it gets going
again. Now your father&#151;"</p>

<p>"Oh, don't tell me," she said.</p>

<p>"His principal fuel was fear," he continued. "He got afraid,
and off he went. He'll probably live till ninety&#151;"</p>

<p>"Please don't tell me any more," she said. "Please don't&#151;I
couldn't stand any more."</p>

<p>"All right. The little devil I came down to see is hopeless.
We may as well go back to-morrow."</p>

<p>"I don't see why you have to&#151;come in contact with all this,"
she burst forth.</p>

<p>"Oh, don't you? Sometimes I don't either."</p>

<p>She put her hand on his.</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm sorry I said that, Dick."</p>

<p>Some one had brought a phonograph into the bar and they sat
listening to The Wedding of the Painted Doll.</p>
