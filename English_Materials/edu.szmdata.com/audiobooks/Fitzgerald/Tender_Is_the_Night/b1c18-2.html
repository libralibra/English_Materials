<p class="storyTitle">XVIII</p>





<p>Although the Divers were honestly apathetic to organized
fashion, they were nevertheless too acute to abandon its
contemporaneous rhythm and beat&#151;Dick's parties were all
concerned with excitement, and a chance breath of fresh night air
was the more precious for being experienced in the intervals of
the excitement.</p>

<p>The party that night moved with the speed of a slapstick
comedy. They were twelve, they were sixteen, they were quartets
in separate motors bound on a quick Odyssey over Paris.
Everything had been foreseen. People joined them as if by magic,
accompanied them as specialists, almost guides, through a phase
of the evening, dropped out and were succeeded by other people,
so that it appeared as if the freshness of each one had been
husbanded for them all day. Rosemary appreciated how different it
was from any party in Hollywood, no matter how splendid in scale.
There was, among many diversions, the car of the Shah of Persia.
Where Dick had commandeered this vehicle, what bribery was
employed, these were facts of irrelevance. Rosemary accepted it
as merely a new facet of the fabulous, which for two years had
filled her life. The car had been built on a special chassis in
America. Its wheels were of silver, so was the radiator. The
inside of the body was inlaid with innumerable brilliants which
would be replaced with true gems by the court jeweller when the
car arrived in Teheran the following week. There was only one
real seat in back, because the Shah must ride alone, so they took
turns riding in it and sitting on the marten fur that covered the
floor.</p>

<p>But always there was Dick. Rosemary assured the image of her
mother, ever carried with her, that never, never had she known
any one so nice, so thoroughly nice as Dick was that night. She
compared him with the two Englishmen, whom Abe addressed
conscientiously as "Major Hengest and Mr. Horsa," and with the
heir to a Scandinavian throne and the novelist just back from
Russia, and with Abe, who was desperate and witty, and with
Collis Clay, who joined them somewhere and stayed along&#151;and felt
there was no comparison. The enthusiasm, the selflessness behind
the whole performance ravished her, the technic of moving many
varied types, each as immobile, as dependent on supplies of
attention as an infantry battalion is dependent on rations,
appeared so effortless that he still had pieces of his own most
personal self for everyone.</p>

<p>&#151;Afterward she remembered the times when she had felt the
happiest. The first time was when she and Dick danced together
and she felt her beauty sparkling bright against his tall, strong
form as they floated, hovering like people in an amusing
dream&#151;he turned her here and there with such a delicacy of
suggestion that she was like a bright bouquet, a piece of
precious cloth being displayed before fifty eyes. There was a
moment when they were not dancing at all, simply clinging
together. Some time in the early morning they were alone, and her
damp powdery young body came up close to him in a crush of tired
cloth, and stayed there, crushed against a background of other
people's hats and wraps. . . .</p>

<p>The time she laughed most was later, when six of them, the
best of them, noblest relics of the evening, stood in the dusky
front lobby of the Ritz telling the night concierge that General
Pershing was outside and wanted caviare and champagne. "He brooks
no delay. Every man, every gun is at his service." Frantic
waiters emerged from nowhere, a table was set in the lobby, and
Abe came in representing General Pershing while they stood up and
mumbled remembered fragments of war songs at him. In the waiters'
injured reaction to this anti-climax they found themselves
neglected, so they built a waiter trap&#151;a huge and fantastic
device constructed of all the furniture in the lobby and
functioning like one of the bizarre machines of a Goldberg
cartoon. Abe shook his head doubtfully at it.</p>

<p>"Perhaps it would be better to steal a musical saw and&#151;"</p>

<p>"That's enough," Mary interrupted. "When Abe begins bringing
up that it's time to go home." Anxiously she confided to
Rosemary:</p>

<p>"I've got to get Abe home. His boat train leaves at eleven.
It's so important&#151;I feel the whole future depends on his
catching it, but whenever I argue with him he does the exact
opposite."</p>

<p>"I'll try and persuade him," offered Rosemary.</p>

<p>"Would you?" Mary said doubtfully. "Maybe you could."</p>

<p>Then Dick came up to Rosemary:</p>

<p>"Nicole and I are going home and we thought you'd want to go
with us."</p>

<p>Her face was pale with fatigue in the false dawn. Two wan dark
spots in her cheek marked where the color was by day.</p>

<p>"I can't," she said. "I promised Mary North to stay along with
them&#151;or Abe'll never go to bed. Maybe you could do
something."</p>

<p>"Don't you know you can't do anything about people?" he
advised her. "If Abe was my room-mate in college, tight for the
first time, it'd be different. Now there's nothing to do."</p>

<p>"Well, I've got to stay. He says he'll go to bed if we only
come to the Halles with him," she said, almost defiantly.</p>

<p>He kissed the inside of her elbow quickly.</p>

<p>"Don't let Rosemary go home alone," Nicole called to Mary as
they left. "We feel responsible to her mother."</p>

<p>&#151;Later Rosemary and the Norths and a manufacturer of dolls'
voices from Newark and ubiquitous Collis and a big splendidly
dressed oil Indian named George T. Horseprotection were riding
along on top of thousands of carrots in a market wagon. The earth
in the carrot beards was fragrant and sweet in the darkness, and
Rosemary was so high up in the load that she could hardly see the
others in the long shadow between infrequent street lamps. Their
voices came from far off, as if they were having experiences
different from hers, different and far away, for she was with
Dick in her heart, sorry she had come with the Norths, wishing
she was at the hotel and him asleep across the hall, or that he
was here beside her with the warm darkness streaming down.</p>

<p>"Don't come up," she called to Collis, "the carrots will all
roll." She threw one at Abe who was sitting beside the driver,
stiffly like an old man. . . .</p>

<p>Later she was homeward bound at last in broad daylight, with
the pigeons already breaking over Saint-Sulpice. All of them
began to laugh spontaneously because they knew it was still last
night while the people in the streets had the delusion that it
was bright hot morning.</p>

<p>"At last I've been on a wild party," thought Rosemary, "but
it's no fun when Dick isn't there."</p>

<p>She felt a little betrayed and sad, but presently a moving
object came into sight. It was a huge horse-chestnut tree in full
bloom bound for the Champs Élysées, strapped now
into a long truck and simply shaking with laughter&#151;like a lovely
person in an undignified position yet confident none the less of
being lovely. Looking at it with fascination Rosemary identified
herself with it, and laughed cheerfully with it, and everything
all at once seemed gorgeous.</p>
