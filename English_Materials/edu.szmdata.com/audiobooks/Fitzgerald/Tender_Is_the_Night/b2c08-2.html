<p class="storyTitle">VIII</p>





<p>During the next weeks Dick experienced a vast dissatisfaction.
The pathological origin and mechanistic defeat of the affair left
a flat and metallic taste. Nicole's emotions had been used
unfairly&#151;what if they turned out to have been his own?
Necessarily he must absent himself from felicity a while&#151;in
dreams he saw her walking on the clinic path swinging her wide
straw hat. . . .</p>

<p>One time he saw her in person; as he walked past the Palace
Hotel, a magnificent Rolls curved into the half-moon entrance.
Small within its gigantic proportions, and buoyed up by the power
of a hundred superfluous horses, sat Nicole and a young woman
whom he assumed was her sister. Nicole saw him and momentarily
her lips parted in an expression of fright. Dick shifted his hat
and passed, yet for a moment the air around him was loud with the
circlings of all the goblins on the Gross-Münster. He tried
to write the matter out of his mind in a memorandum that went
into detail as to the solemn régime before her; the
possibilities of another "push" of the malady under the stresses
which the world would inevitably supply&#151;in all a memorandum that
would have been convincing to any one save to him who had written
it.</p>

<p>The total value of this effort was to make him realize once
more how far his emotions were involved; thenceforth he
resolutely provided antidotes. One was the telephone girl from
Bar-sur-Aube, now touring Europe from Nice to Coblenz, in a
desperate roundup of the men she had known in her
never-to-be-equalled holiday; another was the making of
arrangements to get home on a government transport in August; a
third was a consequent intensification of work on his proofs for
the book that this autumn was to be presented to the
German-speaking world of psychiatry.</p>

<p>Dick had outgrown the book; he wanted now to do more spade
work; if he got an exchange fellowship he could count on plenty
of routine.</p>

<p>Meanwhile he had projected a new work: <i>An Attempt at a
Uniform and Pragmatic Classification of the Neuroses and
Psychoses, Based on an Examination of Fifteen Hundred
Pre-Krapælin and Post-Krapælin Cases as they would be
Diagnosed in the Terminology of the Different Contemporary
Schools</i>&#151;and another sonorous paragraph&#151;<i>Together with a
Chronology of Such Subdivisions of Opinion as Have Arisen
Independently.</i></p>

<p>This title would look monumental in German.*</p>



<p>*Ein Versuch die Neurosen und Psychosen gleichmässig und
pragmatisch zu klassifizieren auf Grund der Untersuchung von
fünfzehn hundert pre-Krapaelin und post-Krapaelin
Fällen wie siz diagnostiziert sein würden in der
Terminologie von den verschiedenen Schulen der Gegenwart&#151;and
another sonorous paragraph&#151;Zusammen mit einer Chronologic
solcher Subdivisionen der Meinung welche unabhängig
entstanden sind.</p>



<p>Going into Montreux Dick pedalled slowly, gaping at the
Jugenhorn whenever possible, and blinded by glimpses of the lake
through the alleys of the shore hotels. He was conscious of the
groups of English, emergent after four years and walking with
detective-story suspicion in their eyes, as though they were
about to be assaulted in this questionable country by German
trained-bands. There were building and awakening everywhere on
this mound of débris formed by a mountain torrent. At
Berne and at Lausanne on the way south, Dick had been eagerly
asked if there would be Americans this year. "By August, if not
in June?"</p>

<p>He wore leather shorts, an army shirt, mountain shoes. In his
knapsack were a cotton suit and a change of underwear. At the
Glion funicular he checked his bicycle and took a small beer on
the terrace of the station buffet, meanwhile watching the little
bug crawl down the eighty-degree slope of the hill. His ear was
full of dried blood from La Tour de Pelz, where he had sprinted
under the impression that he was a spoiled athlete. He asked for
alcohol and cleared up the exterior while the funicular slid down
port. He saw his bicycle embarked, slung his knapsack into the
lower compartment of the car, and followed it in.</p>

<p>Mountain-climbing cars are built on a slant similar to the
angle of a hat-brim of a man who doesn't want to be recognized.
As water gushed from the chamber under the car, Dick was
impressed with the ingenuity of the whole idea&#151;a complimentary
car was now taking on mountain water at the top and would pull
the lightened car up by gravity, as soon as the brakes were
released. It must have been a great inspiration. In the seat
across, a couple of British were discussing the cable itself.</p>

<p>"The ones made in England always last five or six years. Two
years ago the Germans underbid us, and how long do you think
their cable lasted?"</p>

<p>"How long?"</p>

<p>"A year and ten months. Then the Swiss sold it to the
Italians. They don't have rigid inspections of cables."</p>

<p>"I can see it would be a terrible thing for Switzerland if a
cable broke."</p>

<p>The conductor shut a door; he telephoned his confrere among
the undulati, and with a jerk the car was pulled upward, heading
for a pinpoint on an emerald hill above. After it cleared the low
roofs, the skies of Vaud, Valais, Swiss Savoy, and Geneva spread
around the passengers in cyclorama. On the centre of the lake,
cooled by the piercing current of the Rhône, lay the true
centre of the Western World. Upon it floated swans like boats and
boats like swans, both lost in the nothingness of the heartless
beauty. It was a bright day, with sun glittering on the grass
beach below and the white courts of the Kursal. The figures on
the courts threw no shadows.</p>

<p>When Chillon and the island palace of Salagnon came into view
Dick turned his eyes inward. The funicular was above the highest
houses of the shore; on both sides a tangle of foliage and
flowers culminated at intervals in masses of color. It was a
rail-side garden, and in the car was a sign: <i>Défense de
cueillir les fleurs.</i></p>

<p>Though one must not pick flowers on the way up, the blossoms
trailed in as they passed&#151;Dorothy Perkins roses dragged
patiently through each compartment slowly waggling with the
motion of the funicular, letting go at the last to swing back to
their rosy cluster. Again and again these branches went through
the car.</p>

<p>In the compartment above and in front of Dick's, a group of
English were standing up and exclaiming upon the backdrop of sky,
when suddenly there was a confusion among them&#151;they parted to
give passage to a couple of young people who made apologies and
scrambled over into the rear compartment of the funicular&#151;Dick's
compartment. The young man was a Latin with the eyes of a stuffed
deer; the girl was Nicole.</p>

<p>The two climbers gasped momentarily from their efforts; as
they settled into seats, laughing and crowding the English to the
corners, Nicole said, "Hel<i>lo</i>." She was lovely to look at;
immediately Dick saw that something was different; in a second he
realized it was her fine-spun hair, bobbed like Irene Castle's
and fluffed into curls. She wore a sweater of powder blue and a
white tennis skirt&#151;she was the first morning in May and every
taint of the clinic was departed.</p>

<p>"Plunk!" she gasped. "Whoo-oo that guard. They'll arrest us at
the next stop. Doctor Diver, the Conte de Marmora."</p>

<p>"Gee-imminy!" She felt her new hair, panting. "Sister bought
first-class tickets&#151;it's a matter of principle with her." She
and Marmora exchanged glances and shouted: "Then we found that
first-class is the hearse part behind the chauffeur&#151;shut in with
curtains for a rainy day, so you can't see anything. But Sister's
very dignified&#151;" Again Nicole and Marmora laughed with young
intimacy.</p>

<p>"Where you bound?" asked Dick.</p>

<p>"Caux. You too?" Nicole looked at his costume. "That your
bicycle they got up in front?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I'm going to coast down Monday."</p>

<p>"With me on your handle-bars? I mean, really&#151;will you? I
can't think of more fun."</p>

<p>"But I will carry you down in my arms," Marmora protested
intensely. "I will roller-skate you&#151;or I will throw you and you
will fall slowly like a feather."</p>

<p>The delight in Nicole's face&#151;to be a feather again instead of
a plummet, to float and not to drag. She was a carnival to
watch&#151;at times primly coy, posing, grimacing and
gesturing&#151;sometimes the shadow fell and the dignity of old
suffering flowed down into her finger tips. Dick wished himself
away from her, fearing that he was a reminder of a world well
left behind. He resolved to go to the other hotel.</p>

<p>When the funicular came to rest those new to it stirred in
suspension between the blues of two heavens. It was merely for a
mysterious exchange between the conductor of the car going up and
the conductor of the car coming down. Then up and up over a
forest path and a gorge&#151;then again up a hill that became solid
with narcissus, from passengers to sky. The people in Montreux
playing tennis in the lakeside courts were pinpoints now.
Something new was in the air; freshness&#151;freshness embodying
itself in music as the car slid into Glion and they heard the
orchestra in the hotel garden.</p>

<p>When they changed to the mountain train the music was drowned
by the rushing water released from the hydraulic chamber. Almost
overhead was Caux, where the thousand windows of a hotel burned
in the late sun.</p>

<p>But the approach was different&#151;a leather-lunged engine pushed
the passengers round and round in a corkscrew, mounting, rising;
they chugged through low-level clouds and for a moment Dick lost
Nicole's face in the spray of the slanting donkey engine; they
skirted a lost streak of wind with the hotel growing in size at
each spiral, until with a vast surprise they were there, on top
of the sunshine.</p>

<p>In the confusion of arrival, as Dick slung his knapsack and
started forward on the platform to get his bicycle, Nicole was
beside him.</p>

<p>"Aren't you at our hotel?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I'm economizing."</p>

<p>"Will you come down and have dinner?" Some confusion with
baggage ensued. "This is my sister&#151;Doctor Diver from
Zurich."</p>

<p>Dick bowed to a young woman of twenty-five, tall and
confident. She was both formidable and vulnerable, he decided,
remembering other women with flower-like mouths grooved for
bits.</p>

<p>"I'll drop in after dinner," Dick promised. "First I must get
acclimated."</p>

<p>He wheeled off his bicycle, feeling Nicole's eyes following
him, feeling her helpless first love, feeling it twist around
inside him. He went three hundred yards up the slope to the other
hotel, he engaged a room and found himself washing without a
memory of the intervening ten minutes, only a sort of drunken
flush pierced with voices, unimportant voices that did not know
how much he was loved.</p>
