<p>Rosemary went to Monte Carlo nearly as sulkily as it was
possible for her to be. She rode up the rugged hill to La Turbie,
to an old Gaumont lot in process of reconstruction, and as she
stood by the grilled entrance waiting for an answer to the
message on her card, she might have been looking into Hollywood.
The bizarre d√©bris of some recent picture, a decayed
street scene in India, a great cardboard whale, a monstrous tree
bearing cherries large as basketballs, bloomed there by exotic
dispensation, autochthonous as the pale amaranth, mimosa, cork
oak or dwarfed pine. There were a quick-lunch shack and two
barnlike stages and everywhere about the lot, groups of waiting,
hopeful, painted faces.</p>

<p>After ten minutes a young man with hair the color of canary
feathers hurried down to the gate.</p>

<p>"Come in, Miss Hoyt. Mr. Brady's on the set, but he's very
anxious to see you. I'm sorry you were kept waiting, but you know
some of these French dames are worse about pushing themselves
in&#151;"</p>

<p>The studio manager opened a small door in the blank wall of
stage building and with sudden glad familiarity Rosemary followed
him into half darkness. Here and there figures spotted the
twilight, turning up ashen faces to her like souls in purgatory
watching the passage of a mortal through. There were whispers and
soft voices and, apparently from afar, the gentle tremolo of a
small organ. Turning the corner made by some flats, they came
upon the white crackling glow of a stage, where a French
actor&#151;his shirt front, collar, and cuffs tinted a brilliant
pink&#151;and an American actress stood motionless face to face. They
stared at each other with dogged eyes, as though they had been in
the same position for hours; and still for a long time nothing
happened, no one moved. A bank of lights went off with a savage
hiss, went on again; the plaintive tap of a hammer begged
admission to nowhere in the distance; a blue face appeared among
the blinding lights above, called something unintelligible into
the upper blackness. Then the silence was broken by a voice in
front of Rosemary.</p>

<p>"Baby, you don't take off the stockings, you can spoil ten
more pairs. That dress is fifteen pounds."</p>

<p>Stepping backward the speaker ran against Rosemary, whereupon
the studio manager said, "Hey, Earl&#151;Miss Hoyt."</p>

<p>They were meeting for the first time. Brady was quick and
strenuous. As he took her hand she saw him look her over from
head to foot, a gesture she recognized and that made her feel at
home, but gave her always a faint feeling of superiority to
whoever made it. If her person was property she could exercise
whatever advantage was inherent in its ownership.</p>

<p>"I thought you'd be along any day now," Brady said, in a voice
that was just a little too compelling for private life, and that
trailed with it a faintly defiant cockney accent. "Have a good
trip?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but we're glad to be going home."</p>

<p>"No-o-o!" he protested. "Stay awhile&#151;I want to talk to you.
Let me tell you that was some picture of yours&#151;that 'Daddy's
Girl.' I saw it in Paris. I wired the coast right away to see if
you were signed."</p>

<p>"I just had&#151;I'm sorry."</p>

<p>"God, what a picture!"</p>

<p>Not wanting to smile in silly agreement Rosemary frowned.</p>

<p>"Nobody wants to be thought of forever for just one picture,"
she said.</p>

<p>"Sure&#151;that's right. What're your plans?"</p>

<p>"Mother thought I needed a rest. When I get back we'll
probably either sign up with First National or keep on with
Famous."</p>

<p>"Who's we?"</p>

<p>"My mother. She decides business matters. I couldn't do
without her."</p>

<p>Again he looked her over completely, and, as he did, something
in Rosemary went out to him. It was not liking, not at all the
spontaneous admiration she had felt for the man on the beach this
morning. It was a click. He desired her and, so far as her
virginal emotions went, she contemplated a surrender with
equanimity. Yet she knew she would forget him half an hour after
she left him&#151;like an actor kissed in a picture.</p>

<p>"Where are you staying?" Brady asked. "Oh, yes, at Gausse's.
Well, my plans are made for this year, too, but that letter I
wrote you still stands. Rather make a picture with you than any
girl since Connie Talmadge was a kid."</p>

<p>"I feel the same way. Why don't you come back to
Hollywood?"</p>

<p>"I can't stand the damn place. I'm fine here. Wait till after
this shot and I'll show you around."</p>

<p>Walking onto the set he began to talk to the French actor in a
low, quiet voice.</p>

<p>Five minutes passed&#151;Brady talked on, while from time to time
the Frenchman shifted his feet and nodded. Abruptly, Brady broke
off, calling something to the lights that startled them into a
humming glare. Los Angeles was loud about Rosemary now.
Unappalled she moved once more through the city of thin
partitions, wanting to be back there. But she did not want to see
Brady in the mood she sensed he would be in after he had finished
and she left the lot with a spell still upon her. The
Mediterranean world was less silent now that she knew the studio
was there. She liked the people on the streets and bought herself
a pair of espadrilles on the way to the train.</p>





<p>Her mother was pleased that she had done so accurately what
she was told to do, but she still wanted to launch her out and
away. Mrs. Speers was fresh in appearance but she was tired;
death beds make people tired indeed and she had watched beside a
couple.</p>
