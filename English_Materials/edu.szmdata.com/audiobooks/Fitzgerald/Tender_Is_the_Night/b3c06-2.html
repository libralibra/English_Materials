<p>Next morning Dick came early into Nicole's room. "I waited
till I heard you up. Needless to say I feel badly about the
evening&#151;but how about no postmortems?"</p>

<p>"I'm agreed," she answered coolly, carrying her face to the
mirror.</p>

<p>"Tommy drove us home? Or did I dream it?"</p>

<p>"You know he did."</p>

<p>"Seems probable," he admitted, "since I just heard him
coughing. I think I'll call on him."</p>

<p>She was glad when he left her, for almost the first time in
her life&#151;his awful faculty of being right seemed to have
deserted him at last.</p>

<p>Tommy was stirring in his bed, waking for café au
lait.</p>

<p>"Feel all right?" Dick asked.</p>

<p>When Tommy complained of a sore throat he seized at a
professional attitude.</p>

<p>"Better have a gargle or something."</p>

<p>"You have one?"</p>

<p>"Oddly enough I haven't&#151;probably Nicole has."</p>

<p>"Don't disturb her."</p>

<p>"She's up."</p>

<p>"How is she?"</p>

<p>Dick turned around slowly. "Did you expect her to be dead
because I was tight?" His tone was pleasant. "Nicole is now made
of&#151;of Georgia pine, which is the hardest wood known, except
lignum vitæ from New Zealand&#151;"</p>

<p>Nicole, going downstairs, heard the end of the conversation.
She knew, as she had always known, that Tommy loved her; she knew
he had come to dislike Dick, and that Dick had realized it before
he did, and would react in some positive way to the man's lonely
passion. This thought was succeeded by a moment of sheerly
feminine satisfaction. She leaned over her children's breakfast
table and told off instructions to the governess, while upstairs
two men were concerned about her.</p>

<p>Later in the garden she was happy; she did not want anything
to happen, but only for the situation to remain in suspension as
the two men tossed her from one mind to another; she had not
existed for a long time, even as a ball.</p>

<p>"Nice, Rabbits, isn't it&#151;Or is it? Hey, Rabbit&#151;hey you! Is
it nice?&#151;hey? Or does it sound very peculiar to you?"</p>

<p>The rabbit, after an experience of practically nothing else
and cabbage leaves, agreed after a few tentative shiftings of the
nose.</p>

<p>Nicole went on through her garden routine. She left the
flowers she cut in designated spots to be brought to the house
later by the gardener. Reaching the sea wall she fell into a
communicative mood and no one to communicate with; so she stopped
and deliberated. She was somewhat shocked at the idea of being
interested in another man&#151;but other women have lovers&#151;why not
me? In the fine spring morning the inhibitions of the male world
disappeared and she reasoned as gaily as a flower, while the wind
blew her hair until her head moved with it. Other women have had
lovers&#151;the same forces that last night had made her yield to
Dick up to the point of death, now kept her head nodding to the
wind, content and happy with the logic of, Why shouldn't I?</p>

<p>She sat upon the low wall and looked down upon the sea. But
from another sea, the wide swell of fantasy, she had fished out
something tangible to lay beside the rest of her loot. If she
need not, in her spirit, be forever one with Dick as he had
appeared last night, she must be something in addition, not just
an image on his mind, condemned to endless parades around the
circumference of a medal.</p>

<p>Nicole had chosen this part of the wall on which to sit,
because the cliff shaded to a slanting meadow with a cultivated
vegetable garden. Through a cluster of boughs she saw two men
carrying rakes and spades and talking in a counterpoint of
Niçoise and Provençal. Attracted by their words and
gestures she caught the sense:</p>

<p>"I laid her down here."</p>

<p>"I took her behind the vines there."</p>

<p>"She doesn't care&#151;neither does he. It was that sacred dog.
Well, I laid her down here&#151;"</p>

<p>"You got the rake?"</p>

<p>"You got it yourself, you clown."</p>

<p>"Well, I don't care where you laid her down. Until that night
I never even felt a woman's breast against my chest since I
married&#151;twelve years ago. And now you tell me&#151;"</p>

<p>"But listen about the dog&#151;"</p>

<p>Nicole watched them through the boughs; it seemed all right
what they were saying&#151;one thing was good for one person, another
for another. Yet it was a man's world she had overheard; going
back to the house she became doubtful again.</p>

<p>Dick and Tommy were on the terrace. She walked through them
and into the house, brought out a sketch pad and began a head of
Tommy.</p>

<p>"Hands never idle&#151;distaff flying," Dick said lightly. How
could he talk so trivially with the blood still drained down from
his cheeks so that the auburn lather of beard showed red as his
eyes? She turned to Tommy saying:</p>

<p>"I can always do something. I used to have a nice active
little Polynesian ape and juggle him around for hours till people
began to make the most dismal rough jokes&#151;"</p>

<p>She kept her eyes resolutely away from Dick. Presently he
excused himself and went inside&#151;she saw him pour himself two
glasses of water, and she hardened further.</p>

<p>"Nicole&#151;" Tommy began but interrupted himself to clear the
harshness from his throat.</p>

<p>"I'm going to get you some special camphor rub," she
suggested. "It's American&#151;Dick believes in it. I'll be just a
minute."</p>

<p>"I must go really."</p>

<p>Dick came out and sat down. "Believes in what?" When she
returned with the jar neither of the men had moved, though she
gathered they had had some sort of excited conversation about
nothing.</p>

<p>The chauffeur was at the door, with a bag containing Tommy's
clothes of the night before. The sight of Tommy in clothes
borrowed from Dick moved her sadly, falsely, as though Tommy were
not able to afford such clothes.</p>

<p>"When you get to the hotel rub this into your throat and chest
and then inhale it," she said.</p>

<p>"Say, there," Dick murmured as Tommy went down the steps,
"don't give Tommy the whole jar&#151;it has to be ordered from
Paris&#151;it's out of stock down here."</p>

<p>Tommy came back within hearing and the three of them stood in
the sunshine, Tommy squarely before the car so that it seemed by
leaning forward he would tip it upon his back.</p>

<p>Nicole stepped down to the path.</p>

<p>"Now catch it," she advised him. "It's extremely rare."</p>

<p>She heard Dick grow silent at her side; she took a step off
from him and waved as the car drove off with Tommy and the
special camphor rub. Then she turned to take her own
medicine.</p>

<p>"There was no necessity for that gesture," Dick said. "There
are four of us here&#151;and for years whenever there's a
cough&#151;"</p>

<p>They looked at each other.</p>

<p>"We can always get another jar&#151;" then she lost her nerve and
presently followed him upstairs where he lay down on his own bed
and said nothing.</p>

<p>"Do you want lunch to be brought up to you?" she asked.</p>

<p>He nodded and continued to lie quiescent, staring at the
ceiling. Doubtfully she went to give the order. Upstairs again
she looked into his room&#151;the blue eyes, like searchlights,
played on a dark sky. She stood a minute in the doorway, aware of
the sin she had committed against him, half afraid to come in. .
. . She put out her hand as if to rub his head, but he turned
away like a suspicious animal. Nicole could stand the situation
no longer; in a kitchen-maid's panic she ran downstairs, afraid
of what the stricken man above would feed on while she must still
continue her dry suckling at his lean chest.</p>





<p>In a week Nicole forgot her flash about Tommy&#151;she had not
much memory for people and forgot them easily. But in the first
hot blast of June she heard he was in Nice. He wrote a little
note to them both&#151;and she opened it under the parasol, together
with other mail they had brought from the house. After reading it
she tossed it over to Dick, and in exchange he threw a telegram
into the lap of her beach pajamas:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Dears will be at Gausses to-morrow unfortunately without
mother am counting on seeing you.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>"I'll be glad to see her," said Nicole, grimly.</p>
