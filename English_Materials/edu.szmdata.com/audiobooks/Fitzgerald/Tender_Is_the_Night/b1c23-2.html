<p class="storyTitle">XXIII</p>





<p>Abe North was still in the Ritz bar, where he had been since
nine in the morning. When he arrived seeking sanctuary the
windows were open and great beams were busy at pulling up the
dust from smoky carpets and cushions. Chasseurs tore through the
corridors, liberated and disembodied, moving for the moment in
pure space. The sit-down bar for women, across from the bar
proper, seemed very small&#151;it was hard to imagine what throngs it
could accommodate in the afternoon.</p>

<p>The famous Paul, the concessionaire, had not arrived, but
Claude, who was checking stock, broke off his work with no
improper surprise to make Abe a pick-me-up. Abe sat on a bench
against a wall. After two drinks he began to feel better&#151;so much
better that he mounted to the barber's shop and was shaved. When
he returned to the bar Paul had arrived&#151;in his custom-built
motor, from which he had disembarked correctly at the Boulevard
des Capucines. Paul liked Abe and came over to talk.</p>

<p>"I was supposed to ship home this morning," Abe said. "I mean
yesterday morning, or whatever this is."</p>

<p>"Why din you?" asked Paul.</p>

<p>Abe considered, and happened finally to a reason: "I was
reading a serial in Liberty and the next installment was due here
in Paris&#151;so if I'd sailed I'd have missed it&#151;then I never would
have read it."</p>

<p>"It must be a very good story."</p>

<p>"It's a terr-r-rible story."</p>

<p>Paul arose chuckling and paused, leaning on the back of a
chair:</p>

<p>"If you really want to get off, Mr. North, there are friends
of yours going to-morrow on the France&#151;Mister what is this
name&#151;and Slim Pearson. Mister&#151;I'll think of it&#151;tall with a new
beard."</p>

<p>"Yardly," Abe supplied.</p>

<p>"Mr. Yardly. They're both going on the France."</p>

<p>He was on his way to his duties but Abe tried to detain him:
"If I didn't have to go by way of Cherbourg. The baggage went
that way."</p>

<p>"Get your baggage in New York," said Paul, receding.</p>

<p>The logic of the suggestion fitted gradually into Abe's
pitch&#151;he grew rather enthusiastic about being cared for, or
rather of prolonging his state of irresponsibility.</p>

<p>Other clients had meanwhile drifted in to the bar: first came
a huge Dane whom Abe had somewhere encountered. The Dane took a
seat across the room, and Abe guessed he would be there all the
day, drinking, lunching, talking or reading newspapers. He felt a
desire to out-stay him. At eleven the college boys began to step
in, stepping gingerly lest they tear one another bag from bag. It
was about then he had the chasseur telephone to the Divers; by
the time he was in touch with them he was in touch also with
other friends&#151;and his hunch was to put them all on different
phones at once&#151;the result was somewhat general. From time to
time his mind reverted to the fact that he ought to go over and
get Freeman out of jail, but he shook off all facts as parts of
the nightmare.</p>

<p>By one o'clock the bar was jammed; amidst the consequent
mixture of voices the staff of waiters functioned, pinning down
their clients to the facts of drink and money.</p>

<p>"That makes two stingers . . . and one more . . . two martinis
and one . . . nothing for you, Mr. Quarterly . . . that makes
three rounds. That makes seventy-five francs, Mr. Quarterly. Mr.
Schaeffer said he had this&#151;you had the last . . . I can only do
what you say . . . thanks vera-much."</p>

<p>In the confusion Abe had lost his seat; now he stood gently
swaying and talking to some of the people with whom he had
involved himself. A terrier ran a leash around his legs but Abe
managed to extricate himself without upsetting and became the
recipient of profuse apologies. Presently he was invited to
lunch, but declined. It was almost Briglith, he explained, and
there was something he had to do at Briglith. A little later,
with the exquisite manners of the alcoholic that are like the
manners of a prisoner or a family servant, he said good-by to an
acquaintance, and turning around discovered that the bar's great
moment was over as precipitately as it had begun.</p>

<p>Across from him the Dane and his companions had ordered
luncheon. Abe did likewise but scarcely touched it. Afterwards,
he just sat, happy to live in the past. The drink made past happy
things contemporary with the present, as if they were still going
on, contemporary even with the future as if they were about to
happen again.</p>

<p>At four the chasseur approached him:</p>

<p>"You wish to see a colored fellow of the name Jules
Peterson?"</p>

<p>"God! How did he find me?"</p>

<p>"I didn't tell him you were present."</p>

<p>"Who did?" Abe fell over his glasses but recovered
himself.</p>

<p>"Says he's already been around to all the American bars and
hotels."</p>

<p>"Tell him I'm not here&#151;" As the chasseur turned away Abe
asked: "Can he come in here?"</p>

<p>"I'll find out."</p>

<p>Receiving the question Paul glanced over his shoulder; he
shook his head, then seeing Abe he came over.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry; I can't allow it."</p>

<p>Abe got himself up with an effort and went out to the Rue
Cambon.</p>
