<p class="storyTitle">IX</p>





<p>It was a limpid black night, hung as in a basket from a single
dull star. The horn of the car ahead was muffled by the
resistance of the thick air. Brady's chauffeur drove slowly; the
tail-light of the other car appeared from time to time at
turnings&#151;then not at all. But after ten minutes it came into
sight again, drawn up at the side of the road. Brady's chauffeur
slowed up behind but immediately it began to roll forward slowly
and they passed it. In the instant they passed it they heard a
blur of voices from behind the reticence of the limousine and saw
that the Divers' chauffeur was grinning. Then they went on, going
fast through the alternating banks of darkness and thin night,
descending at last in a series of roller-coaster swoops, to the
great bulk of Gausse's hotel.</p>

<p>Rosemary dozed for three hours and then lay awake, suspended
in the moonshine. Cloaked by the erotic darkness she exhausted
the future quickly, with all the eventualities that might lead up
to a kiss, but with the kiss itself as blurred as a kiss in
pictures. She changed position in bed deliberately, the first
sign of insomnia she had ever had, and tried to think with her
mother's mind about the question. In this process she was often
acute beyond her experience, with remembered things from old
conversations that had gone into her half-heard.</p>

<p>Rosemary had been brought up with the idea of work. Mrs.
Speers had spent the slim leavings of the men who had widowed her
on her daughter's education, and when she blossomed out at
sixteen with that extraordinary hair, rushed her to Aix-les-Bains
and marched her unannounced into the suite of an American
producer who was recuperating there. When the producer went to
New York they went too. Thus Rosemary had passed her entrance
examinations. With the ensuing success and the promise of
comparative stability that followed, Mrs. Speers had felt free to
tacitly imply tonight:</p>

<p>"You were brought up to work&#151;not especially to marry. Now
you've found your first nut to crack and it's a good nut&#151;go
ahead and put whatever happens down to experience. Wound yourself
or him&#151;whatever happens it can't spoil you because economically
you're a boy, not a girl."</p>

<p>Rosemary had never done much thinking, save about the
illimitability of her mother's perfections, so this final
severance of the umbilical cord disturbed her sleep. A false dawn
sent the sky pressing through the tall French windows, and
getting up she walked out on the terrace, warm to her bare feet.
There were secret noises in the air, an insistent bird achieved
an ill-natured triumph with regularity in the trees above the
tennis court; footfalls followed a round drive in the rear of the
hotel, taking their tone in turn from the dust road, the
crushed-stone walk, the cement steps, and then reversing the
process in going away. Beyond the inky sea and far up that high,
black shadow of a hill lived the Divers. She thought of them both
together, heard them still singing faintly a song like rising
smoke, like a hymn, very remote in time and far away. Their
children slept, their gate was shut for the night.</p>

<p>She went inside and dressing in a light gown and espadrilles
went out her window again and along the continuous terrace toward
the front door, going fast since she found that other private
rooms, exuding sleep, gave upon it. She stopped at the sight of a
figure seated on the wide white stairway of the formal
entrance&#151;then she saw that it was Luis Campion and that he was
weeping.</p>

<p>He was weeping hard and quietly and shaking in the same parts
as a weeping woman. A scene in a role she had played last year
swept over her irresistibly and advancing she touched him on the
shoulder. He gave a little yelp before he recognized her.</p>

<p>"What is it?" Her eyes were level and kind and not slanted
into him with hard curiosity. "Can I help you?"</p>

<p>"Nobody can help me. I knew it. I have only myself to blame.
It's always the same."</p>

<p>"What is it&#151;do you want to tell me?"</p>

<p>He looked at her to see.</p>

<p>"No," he decided. "When you're older you'll know what people
who love suffer. The agony. It's better to be cold and young than
to love. It's happened to me before but never like this&#151;so
accidental&#151;just when everything was going well."</p>

<p>His face was repulsive in the quickening light. Not by a
flicker of her personality, a movement of the smallest muscle,
did she betray her sudden disgust with whatever it was. But
Campion's sensitivity realized it and he changed the subject
rather suddenly.</p>

<p>"Abe North is around here somewhere."</p>

<p>"Why, he's staying at the Divers'!"</p>

<p>"Yes, but he's up&#151;don't you know what happened?"</p>

<p>A shutter opened suddenly in a room two stories above and an
English voice spat distinctly:</p>

<p><i>"Will you kaindlay stup tucking!"</i></p>

<p>Rosemary and Luis Campion went humbly down the steps and to a
bench beside the road to the beach.</p>

<p>"Then you have no idea what's happened? My dear, the most
extraordinary thing&#151;" He was warming up now, hanging on to his
revelation. "I've never seen a thing come so suddenly&#151;I have
always avoided violent people&#151;they upset me so I sometimes have
to go to bed for days."</p>

<p>He looked at her triumphantly. She had no idea what he was
talking about.</p>

<p>"My dear," he burst forth, leaning toward her with his whole
body as he touched her on the upper leg, to show it was no mere
irresponsible venture of his hand&#151;he was so sure of himself.
"There's going to be a duel."</p>

<p>"Wh-at?"</p>

<p>"A duel with&#151;we don't know what yet."</p>

<p>"Who's going to duel?"</p>

<p>"I'll tell you from the beginning." He drew a long breath and
then said, as if it were rather to her discredit but he wouldn't
hold it against her. "Of course, you were in the other
automobile. Well, in a way you were lucky&#151;I lost at least two
years of my life, it came so suddenly."</p>

<p>"What came?" she demanded.</p>

<p>"I don't know what began it. First she began to talk&#151;"</p>

<p>"Who?"</p>

<p>"Violet McKisco." He lowered his voice as if there were people
under the bench. "But don't mention the Divers because he made
threats against anybody who mentioned it."</p>

<p>"Who did?"</p>

<p>"Tommy Barban, so don't you say I so much as mentioned them.
None of us ever found out anyhow what it was Violet had to say
because he kept interrupting her, and then her husband got into
it and now, my dear, we have the duel. This morning&#151;at five
o'clock&#151;in an hour." He sighed suddenly thinking of his own
griefs. "I almost wish it were I. I might as well be killed now I
have nothing to live for." He broke off and rocked to and fro
with sorrow.</p>

<p>Again the iron shutter parted above and the same British voice
said:</p>

<p><i>"Rilly, this must stup immejetely."</i></p>

<p>Simultaneously Abe North, looking somewhat distracted, came
out of the hotel, perceived them against the sky, white over the
sea. Rosemary shook her head warningly before he could speak and
they moved another bench further down the road. Rosemary saw that
Abe was a little tight.</p>

<p>"What are <i>you</i> doing up?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"I just got up." She started to laugh, but remembering the
voice above, she restrained herself.</p>

<p>"Plagued by the nightingale," Abe suggested, and repeated,
"probably plagued by the nightingale. Has this sewing-circle
member told you what happened?"</p>

<p>Campion said with dignity:</p>

<p>"I only know what I heard with my own ears."</p>

<p>He got up and walked swiftly away; Abe sat down beside
Rosemary.</p>

<p>"Why did you treat him so badly?"</p>

<p>"Did I?" he asked surprised. "He's been weeping around here
all morning."</p>

<p>"Well, maybe he's sad about something."</p>

<p>"Maybe he is."</p>

<p>"What about a duel? Who's going to duel? I thought there was
something strange in that car. Is it true?"</p>

<p>"It certainly is coo-coo but it seems to be true."</p>
