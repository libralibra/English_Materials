<p>She woke up cooled and shamed. The sight of her beauty in the
mirror did not reassure her but only awakened the ache of
yesterday and a letter, forwarded by her mother, from the boy who
had taken her to the Yale prom last fall, which announced his
presence in Paris was no help&#151;all that seemed far away. She
emerged from her room for the ordeal of meeting the Divers
weighted with a double trouble. But it was hidden by a sheath as
impermeable as Nicole's when they met and went together to a
series of fittings. It was consoling, though, when Nicole
remarked, apropos of a distraught saleswoman: "Most people think
everybody feels about them much more violently than they actually
do&#151;they think other people's opinions of them swing through
great arcs of approval or disapproval." Yesterday in her
expansiveness Rosemary would have resented that remark&#151;to-day in
her desire to minimize what had happened she welcomed it eagerly.
She admired Nicole for her beauty and her wisdom, and also for
the first time in her life she was jealous. Just before leaving
Gausse's hotel her mother had said in that casual tone, which
Rosemary knew concealed her most significant opinions, that
Nicole was a great beauty, with the frank implication that
Rosemary was not. This did not bother Rosemary, who had only
recently been allowed to learn that she was even personable; so
that her prettiness never seemed exactly her own but rather an
acquirement, like her French. Nevertheless, in the taxi she
looked at Nicole, matching herself against her. There were all
the potentialities for romantic love in that lovely body and in
the delicate mouth, sometimes tight, sometimes expectantly half
open to the world. Nicole had been a beauty as a young girl and
she would be a beauty later when her skin stretched tight over
her high cheekbones&#151;the essential structure was there. She had
been white-Saxon-blonde but she was more beautiful now that her
hair had darkened than when it had been like a cloud and more
beautiful than she.</p>

<p>"We lived there," Rosemary suddenly pointed to a building in
the Rue des Saints-PÃ©res.</p>

<p>"That's strange. Because when I was twelve Mother and Baby and
I once spent a winter there," and she pointed to a hotel directly
across the street. The two dingy fronts stared at them, gray
echoes of girlhood.</p>

<p>"We'd just built our Lake Forest house and we were
economizing," Nicole continued. "At least Baby and I and the
governess economized and Mother travelled."</p>

<p>"We were economizing too," said Rosemary, realizing that the
word meant different things to them.</p>

<p>"Mother always spoke of it very carefully as a small hotel&#151;"
Nicole gave her quick magnetic little laugh, "&#151;I mean instead of
saying a 'cheap' hotel. If any swanky friends asked us our
address we'd never say, 'We're in a dingy little hole over in the
apache quarter where we're glad of running water,'&#151;we'd say
'We're in a small hotel.' As if all the big ones were too noisy
and vulgar for us. Of course the friends always saw through us
and told everyone about it, but Mother always said it showed we
knew our way around Europe. She did, of course: she was born a
German citizen. But her mother was American, and she was brought
up in Chicago, and she was more American than European."</p>

<p>They were meeting the others in two minutes, and Rosemary
reconstructed herself once more as they got out of the taxi in
the Rue Guynemer, across from the Luxembourg Gardens. They were
lunching in the Norths' already dismantled apartment high above
the green mass of leaves. The day seemed different to Rosemary
from the day before&#151;When she saw him face to face their eyes met
and brushed like birds' wings. After that everything was all
right, everything was wonderful, she knew that he was beginning
to fall in love with her. She felt wildly happy, felt the warm
sap of emotion being pumped through her body. A cool, clear
confidence deepened and sang in her. She scarcely looked at Dick
but she knew everything was all right.</p>

<p>After luncheon the Divers and the Norths and Rosemary went to
the Franco-American Films, to be joined by Collis Clay, her young
man from New Haven, to whom she had telephoned. He was a
Georgian, with the peculiarly regular, even stencilled ideas of
Southerners who are educated in the North. Last winter she had
thought him attractive&#151;once they held hands in an automobile
going from New Haven to New York; now he no longer existed for
her.</p>

<p>In the projection room she sat between Collis Clay and Dick
while the mechanic mounted the reels of <i>Daddy's Girl</i> and a
French executive fluttered about her trying to talk American
slang. "Yes, boy," he said when there was trouble with the
projector, "I have not any benenas." Then the lights went out,
there was the sudden click and a flickering noise and she was
alone with Dick at last. They looked at each other in the half
darkness.</p>

<p>"Dear Rosemary," he murmured. Their shoulders touched. Nicole
stirred restlessly at the end of the row and Abe coughed
convulsively and blew his nose; then they all settled down and
the picture ran.</p>

<p>There she was&#151;the school girl of a year ago, hair down her
back and rippling out stiffly like the solid hair of a tanagra
figure; there she was&#151;<i>so</i> young and innocent&#151;the product
of her mother's loving care; there she was&#151;embodying all the
immaturity of the race, cutting a new cardboard paper doll to
pass before its empty harlot's mind. She remembered how she had
felt in that dress, especially fresh and new under the fresh
young silk.</p>

<p>Daddy's girl. Was it a 'itty-bitty bravekins and did it
suffer? Ooo-ooo-tweet, de tweetest thing, wasn't she dest too
tweet? Before her tiny fist the forces of lust and corruption
rolled away; nay, the very march of destiny stopped; inevitable
became evitable, syllogism, dialectic, all rationality fell away.
Women would forget the dirty dishes at home and weep, even within
the picture one woman wept so long that she almost stole the film
away from Rosemary. She wept all over a set that cost a fortune,
in a Duncan Phyfe dining-room, in an aviation port, and during a
yacht-race that was only used in two flashes, in a subway and
finally in a bathroom. But Rosemary triumphed. Her fineness of
character, her courage and steadfastness intruded upon by the
vulgarity of the world, and Rosemary showing what it took with a
face that had not yet become mask-like&#151;yet it was actually so
moving that the emotions of the whole row of people went out to
her at intervals during the picture. There was a break once and
the light went on and after the chatter of applause Dick said to
her sincerely: "I'm simply astounded. You're going to be one of
the best actresses on the stage."</p>

<p>Then back to <i>Daddy's Girl:</i> happier days now, and a
lovely shot of Rosemary and her parent united at the last in a
father complex so apparent that Dick winced for all psychologists
at the vicious sentimentality. The screen vanished, the lights
went on, the moment had come.</p>

<p>"I've arranged one other thing," announced Rosemary to the
company at large, "I've arranged a test for Dick."</p>

<p>"A what?"</p>

<p>"A screen test, they'll take one now."</p>

<p>There was an awful silence&#151;then an irrepressible chortle from
the Norths. Rosemary watched Dick comprehend what she meant, his
face moving first in an Irish way; simultaneously she realized
that she had made some mistake in the playing of her trump and
still she did not suspect that the card was at fault.</p>

<p>"I don't want a test," said Dick firmly; then, seeing the
situation as a whole, he continued lightly, "Rosemary, I'm
disappointed. The pictures make a fine career for a woman&#151;but my
God, they can't photograph me. I'm an old scientist all wrapped
up in his private life."</p>

<p>Nicole and Mary urged him ironically to seize the opportunity;
they teased him, both faintly annoyed at not having been asked
for a sitting. But Dick closed the subject with a somewhat tart
discussion of actors: "The strongest guard is placed at the
gateway to nothing," he said. "Maybe because the condition of
emptiness is too shameful to be divulged."</p>

<p>In the taxi with Dick and Collis Clay&#151;they were dropping
Collis, and Dick was taking Rosemary to a tea from which Nicole
and the Norths had resigned in order to do the things Abe had
left undone till the last&#151;in the taxi Rosemary reproached
him.</p>

<p>"I thought if the test turned out to be good I could take it
to California with me. And then maybe if they liked it you'd come
out and be my leading man in a picture."</p>

<p>He was overwhelmed. "It was a darn sweet thought, but I'd
rather look at <i>you.</i> You were about the nicest sight I ever
looked at."</p>

<p>"That's a great picture," said Collis. "I've seen it four
times. I know one boy at New Haven who's seen it a dozen
times&#151;he went all the way to Hartford to see it one time. And
when I brought Rosemary up to New Haven he was so shy he wouldn't
meet her. Can you beat that? This little girl knocks them
cold."</p>

<p>Dick and Rosemary looked at each other, wanting to be alone,
but Collis failed to understand.</p>

<p>"I'll drop you where you're going," he suggested. "I'm staying
at the Lutetia."</p>

<p>"We'll drop you," said Dick.</p>

<p>"It'll be easier for me to drop you. No trouble at all."</p>

<p>"I think it will be better if we drop you."</p>

<p>"But&#151;" began Collis; he grasped the situation at last and
began discussing with Rosemary when he would see her again.</p>

<p>Finally, he was gone, with the shadowy unimportance but the
offensive bulk of the third party. The car stopped unexpectedly,
unsatisfactorily, at the address Dick had given. He drew a long
breath.</p>

<p>"Shall we go in?"</p>

<p>"I don't care," Rosemary said. "I'll do anything you
want."</p>

<p>He considered.</p>

<p>"I almost have to go in&#151;she wants to buy some pictures from a
friend of mine who needs the money."</p>

<p>Rosemary smoothed the brief expressive disarray of her
hair.</p>

<p>"We'll stay just five minutes," he decided. "You're not going
to like these people."</p>

<p>She assumed that they were dull and stereotyped people, or
gross and drunken people, or tiresome, insistent people, or any
of the sorts of people that the Divers avoided. She was entirely
unprepared for the impression that the scene made on her.</p>
