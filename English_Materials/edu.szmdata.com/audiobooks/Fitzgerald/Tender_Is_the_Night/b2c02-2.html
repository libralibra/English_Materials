<p class="storyTitle">II</p>





<p>It was a damp April day, with long diagonal clouds over the
Albishorn and water inert in the low places. Zurich is not unlike
an American city. Missing something ever since his arrival two
days before, Dick perceived that it was the sense he had had in
finite French lanes that there was nothing more. In Zurich there
was a lot besides Zurich&#151;the roofs upled the eyes to tinkling
cow pastures, which in turn modified hilltops further up&#151;so life
was a perpendicular starting off to a postcard heaven. The Alpine
lands, home of the toy and the funicular, the merry-go-round and
the thin chime, were not a being <i>here,</i> as in France with
French vines growing over one's feet on the ground.</p>

<p>In Salzburg once Dick had felt the superimposed quality of a
bought and borrowed century of music; once in the laboratories of
the university in Zurich, delicately poking at the cervical of a
brain, he had felt like a toy-maker rather than like the tornado
who had hurried through the old red buildings of Hopkins, two
years before, unstayed by the irony of the gigantic Christ in the
entrance hall.</p>

<p>Yet he had decided to remain another two years in Zurich, for
he did not underestimate the value of toy-making, in infinite
precision, of infinite patience.</p>

<p>To-day he went out to see Franz Gregorovius at Dohmler's
clinic on the Zurichsee. Franz, resident pathologist at the
clinic, a Vaudois by birth, a few years older than Dick, met him
at the tram stop. He had a dark and magnificent aspect of
Cagliostro about him, contrasted with holy eyes; he was the third
of the Gregoroviuses&#151;his grandfather had instructed Krapaelin
when psychiatry was just emerging from the darkness of all time.
In personality he was proud, fiery, and sheeplike&#151;he fancied
himself as a hypnotist. If the original genius of the family had
grown a little tired, Franz would without doubt become a fine
clinician.</p>

<p>On the way to the clinic he said: "Tell me of your experiences
in the war. Are you changed like the rest? You have the same
stupid and unaging American face, except I know you're not
stupid, Dick."</p>

<p>"I didn't see any of the war&#151;you must have gathered that from
my letters, Franz."</p>

<p>"That doesn't matter&#151;we have some shell-shocks who merely
heard an air raid from a distance. We have a few who merely read
newspapers."</p>

<p>"It sounds like nonsense to me."</p>

<p>"Maybe it is, Dick. But, we're a rich person's clinic&#151;we
don't use the word nonsense. Frankly, did you come down to see me
or to see that girl?"</p>

<p>They looked sideways at each other; Franz smiled
enigmatically.</p>

<p>"Naturally I saw all the first letters," he said in his
official basso. "When the change began, delicacy prevented me
from opening any more. Really it had become your case."</p>

<p>"Then she's well?" Dick demanded.</p>

<p>"Perfectly well, I have charge of her, in fact I have charge
of the majority of the English and American patients. They call
me Doctor Gregory."</p>

<p>"Let me explain about that girl," Dick said. "I only saw her
one time, that's a fact. When I came out to say good-by to you
just before I went over to France. It was the first time I put on
my uniform and I felt very bogus in it&#151;went around saluting
private soldiers and all that."</p>

<p>"Why didn't you wear it to-day?"</p>

<p>"Hey! I've been discharged three weeks. Here's the way I
happened to see that girl. When I left you I walked down toward
that building of yours on the lake to get my bicycle."</p>

<p>"&#151;toward the 'Cedars'?"</p>

<p>"&#151;a wonderful night, you know&#151;moon over that mountain&#151;"</p>

<p>"The Krenzegg."</p>

<p>"&#151;I caught up with a nurse and a young girl. I didn't think
the girl was a patient; I asked the nurse about tram times and we
walked along. The girl was about the prettiest thing I ever
saw."</p>

<p>"She still is."</p>

<p>"She'd never seen an American uniform and we talked, and I
didn't think anything about it." He broke off, recognizing a
familiar perspective, and then resumed: "&#151;except, Franz, I'm not
as hard-boiled as you are yet; when I see a beautiful shell like
that I can't help feeling a regret about what's inside it. That
was absolutely all&#151;till the letters began to come."</p>

<p>"It was the best thing that could have happened to her," said
Franz dramatically, "a transference of the most fortuitous kind.
That's why I came down to meet you on a very busy day. I want you
to come into my office and talk a long time before you see her.
In fact, I sent her into Zurich to do errands." His voice was
tense with enthusiasm. "In fact, I sent her without a nurse, with
a less stable patient. I'm intensely proud of this case, which I
handled, with your accidental assistance."</p>

<p>The car had followed the shore of the Zurichsee into a fertile
region of pasture farms and low hills, steepled with
châlets. The sun swam out into a blue sea of sky and
suddenly it was a Swiss valley at its best&#151;pleasant sounds and
murmurs and a good fresh smell of health and cheer.</p>

<p>Professor Dohmler's plant consisted of three old buildings and
a pair of new ones, between a slight eminence and the shore of
the lake. At its founding, ten years before, it had been the
first modern clinic for mental illness; at a casual glance no
layman would recognize it as a refuge for the broken, the
incomplete, the menacing, of this world, though two buildings
were surrounded with vine-softened walls of a deceptive height.
Some men raked straw in the sunshine; here and there, as they
rode into the grounds, the car passed the white flag of a nurse
waving beside a patient on a path.</p>

<p>After conducting Dick to his office, Franz excused himself for
half an hour. Left alone Dick wandered about the room and tried
to reconstruct Franz from the litter of his desk, from his books
and the books of and by his father and grandfather; from the
Swiss piety of a huge claret-colored photo of the former on the
wall. There was smoke in the room; pushing open a French window,
Dick let in a cone of sunshine. Suddenly his thoughts swung to
the patient, the girl.</p>

<p>He had received about fifty letters from her written over a
period of eight months. The first one was apologetic, explaining
that she had heard from America how girls wrote to soldiers whom
they did not know. She had obtained the name and address from
Doctor Gregory and she hoped he would not mind if she sometimes
sent word to wish him well, etc., etc.</p>

<p>So far it was easy to recognize the tone&#151;from
"Daddy-Long-Legs" and "Molly-Make-Believe," sprightly and
sentimental epistolary collections enjoying a vogue in the
States. But there the resemblance ended.</p>

<p>The letters were divided into two classes, of which the first
class, up to about the time of the armistice, was of marked
pathological turn, and of which the second class, running from
thence up to the present, was entirely normal, and displayed a
richly maturing nature. For these latter letters Dick had come to
wait eagerly in the last dull months at Bar-sur-Aube&#151;yet even
from the first letters he had pieced together more than Franz
would have guessed of the story.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>MON CAPITAINE:</p>

<p>I thought when I saw you in your uniform you were so handsome.
Then I thought Je m'en fiche French too and German. You thought I
was pretty too but I've had that before and a long time I've
stood it. If you come here again with that attitude base and
criminal and not even faintly what I had been taught to associate
with the role of gentleman then heaven help you. However you seem
quieter than the others,</p>

<p>(2)</p>

<p>all soft like a big cat. I have only gotten to like boys who
are rather sissies. Are you a sissy? There were some
somewhere.</p>

<p>Excuse all this, it is the third letter I have written you and
will send immediately or will never send. I've thought a lot
about moonlight too, and there are many witnesses I could find if
I could only be out of here.</p>

<p>(3)</p>

<p>They said you were a doctor, but so long as you are a cat it
is different. My head aches so, so excuse this walking there like
an ordinary with a white cat will explain, I think. I can speak
three languages, four with English, and am sure I could be useful
interpreting if you arrange such thing in France I'm sure I could
control everything with the belts all bound around everybody like
it was Wednesday. It is now Saturday and</p>

<p>(4)</p>

<p>you are far away, perhaps killed.</p>

<p>Come back to me some day, for I will be here always on this
green hill. Unless they will let me write my father, whom I loved
dearly. Excuse this. I am not myself today. I will write when I
feel better.</p>

<p>Cherio</p>

<p>NICOLE WARREN.</p>

<p>Excuse all this.</p>
</blockquote>



<blockquote>
<p>CAPTAIN DIVER:</p>

<p>I know introspection is not good for a highly nervous state
like mine, but I would like you to know where I stand. Last year
or whenever it was in Chicago when I got so I couldn't speak to
servants or walk in the street I kept waiting for some one to
tell me. It was the duty of some one who understood. The blind
must be led. Only no one would tell me everything&#151;they would
just tell me half and I was already too muddled to put two and
two together. One man was nice&#151;he was a French officer and he
understood. He gave me a flower and said it was "plus petite
et</p>

<p>(2)</p>

<p>moins entendue." We were friends. Then he took it away. I grew
sicker and there was no one to explain to me. They had a song
about Joan of Arc that they used to sing at me but that was just
mean&#151;it would just make me cry, for there was nothing the matter
with my head then. They kept making reference to sports, too, but
I didn't care by that time. So there was that day I went walking
on Michigan Boulevard on and on for miles and finally they
followed me in an automobile, but I wouldn't get</p>

<p>(3)</p>

<p>in. Finally they pulled me in and there were nurses. After
that time I began to realize it all, because I could feel what
was happening in others. So you see how I stand. And what good
can it be for me to stay here with the doctors harping constantly
in the things I was here to get over. So today I have written my
father to come and take me away. I am glad</p>

<p>(4)</p>

<p>you are so interested in examining people and sending them
back. It must be so much fun.</p>


</blockquote>

<p>And again, from another letter:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>You might pass up your next examination and write me a letter.
They just sent me some phonograph records in case I should forget
my lesson and I broke them all so the nurse won't speak to me.
They were in English, so that the nurses would not understand.
One doctor in Chicago said I was bluffing, but what he really
meant was that I was a twin six and he had never seen one before.
But I was very busy being mad then, so I didn't care what he
said, when I am very busy being mad I don't usually care what
they say, not if I were a million girls.</p>

<p>You told me that night you'd teach me to play. Well, I think
love is all</p>

<p>(2)</p>

<p>there is or should be. Anyhow I am glad your interest in
examinations keeps you busy.</p>

<p>Tout à vous,</p>

<p>NICOLE WARREN.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>There were other letters among whose helpless cæsuras
lurked darker rhythms.</p>

<p><br>
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>DEAR CAPTAIN DIVER:</p>

<p>I write to you because there is no one else to whom I can turn
and it seems to me if this farcicle situation is apparent to one
as sick as me it should be apparent to you. The mental trouble is
all over and besides that I am completely broken and humiliated,
if that was what they wanted. My family have shamefully neglected
me, there's no use asking them for help or pity. I have had
enough and it is simply ruining my health and wasting my time
pretending that what is the matter with my</p>

<p>(2)</p>

<p>head is curable.</p>

<p>Here I am in what appears to be a semi-insane-asylum, all
because nobody saw fit to tell me the truth about anything. If I
had only known what was going on like I know now I could have
stood it I guess for I am pretty strong, but those who should
have, did not see fit to enlighten me.</p>

<p>(3)</p>

<p>And now, when I know and have paid such a price for knowing,
they sit there with their dogs lives and say I should believe
what I did believe. Especially one does but I know now.</p>

<p>I am lonesome all the time far away from friends and family
across the Atlantic I roam all over the place in a half daze. If
you could get me a position as interpreter (I know French and
German like a native, fair</p>

<p>(4)</p>

<p>Italian and a little Spanish) or in the Red Cross Ambulance or
as a trained nurse, though I would have to train you would prove
a great blessing.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>And again:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Since you will not accept my explanation of what is the matter
you could at least explain to me what you think, because you have
a kind cat's face, and not that funny look that seems to be so
fashionable here. Dr. Gregory gave me a snapshot of you, not as
handsome as you are in your uniform, but younger looking.</p>



<p>MON CAPITAINE:</p>

<p>It was fine to have your postcard. I am so glad you take such
interest in disqualifying nurses&#151;oh, I understood your note very
well indeed. Only I thought from the moment I met you that you
were different.</p>



<p>DEAR CAPITAINE:</p>

<p>I think one thing today and another tomorrow. That is really
all that's the matter with me, except a crazy defiance and a lack
of proportion. I would gladly welcome any alienist you might
suggest. Here they lie in their bath tubs and sing Play in Your
Own Backyard as if I had my</p>

<p>(2)</p>

<p>backyard to play in or any hope which I can find by looking
either backward or forward. They tried it again in the candy
store again and I almost hit the man with the weight, but they
held me.</p>

<p>I am not going to write you any more. I am too unstable.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>And then a month with no letters. And then suddenly the
change.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>&#151;I am slowly coming back to life . . .</p>

<p>&#151;Today the flowers and the clouds . . .</p>

<p>&#151;The war is over and I scarcely knew there was a war . .
.</p>

<p>&#151;How kind you have been! You must be very wise behind your
face like a white cat, except you don't look like that in the
picture Dr. Gregory gave me . . .</p>

<p>&#151;Today I went to Zurich, how strange a feeling to see a city
again.</p>

<p>&#151;Today we went to Berne, it was so nice with the clocks.</p>

<p>&#151;Today we climbed high enough to find asphodel and edelweiss
. . .</p>
</blockquote>



<p>After that the letters were fewer, but he answered them all.
There was one:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I wish someone were in love with me like boys were ages ago
before I was sick. I suppose it will be years, though, before I
could think of anything like that.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>But when Dick's answer was delayed for any reason, there was a
fluttering burst of worry&#151;like a worry of a lover: "Perhaps I
have bored you," and: "Afraid I have presumed," and: "I keep
thinking at night you have been sick."</p>

<p>In actuality Dick was sick with the flu. When he recovered,
all except the formal part of his correspondence was sacrificed
to the consequent fatigue, and shortly afterward the memory of
her became overlaid by the vivid presence of a Wisconsin
telephone girl at headquarters in Bar-sur-Aube. She was
red-lipped like a poster, and known obscenely in the messes as
"The Switchboard."</p>

<p>Franz came back into his office feeling self-important. Dick
thought he would probably be a fine clinician, for the sonorous
or staccato cadences by which he disciplined nurse or patient
came not from his nervous system but from a tremendous and
harmless vanity. His true emotions were more ordered and kept to
himself.</p>

<p>"Now about the girl, Dick," he said. "Of course, I want to
find out about you and tell you about myself, but first about the
girl, because I have been waiting to tell you about it so
long."</p>

<p>He searched for and found a sheaf of papers in a filing
cabinet but after shuffling through them he found they were in
his way and put them on his desk. Instead he told Dick the
story.</p>
