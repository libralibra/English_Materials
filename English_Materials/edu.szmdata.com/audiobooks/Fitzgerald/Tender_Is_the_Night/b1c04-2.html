<p>The matter was solved for her. The McKiscos were not yet there
and she had scarcely spread her peignoir when two men&#151;the man
with the jockey cap and the tall blonde man, given to sawing
waiters in two&#151;left the group and came down toward her.</p>

<p>"Good morning," said Dick Diver. He broke down. "Look&#151;sunburn
or no sunburn, why did you stay away yesterday? We worried about
you."</p>

<p>She sat up and her happy little laugh welcomed their
intrusion.</p>

<p>"We wondered," Dick Diver said, "if you wouldn't come over
this morning. We go in, we take food and drink, so it's a
substantial invitation."</p>

<p>He seemed kind and charming&#151;his voice promised that he would
take care of her, and that a little later he would open up whole
new worlds for her, unroll an endless succession of magnificent
possibilities. He managed the introduction so that her name
wasn't mentioned and then let her know easily that everyone knew
who she was but were respecting the completeness of her private
life&#151;a courtesy that Rosemary had not met with save from
professional people since her success.</p>

<p>Nicole Diver, her brown back hanging from her pearls, was
looking through a recipe book for chicken Maryland. She was about
twenty-four, Rosemary guessed&#151;her face could have been described
in terms of conventional prettiness, but the effect was that it
had been made first on the heroic scale with strong structure and
marking, as if the features and vividness of brow and coloring,
everything we associate with temperament and character had been
molded with a Rodinesque intention, and then chiseled away in the
direction of prettiness to a point where a single slip would have
irreparably diminished its force and quality. With the mouth the
sculptor had taken desperate chances&#151;it was the cupid's bow of a
magazine cover, yet it shared the distinction of the rest.</p>

<p>"Are you here for a long time?" Nicole asked. Her voice was
low, almost harsh.</p>

<p>Suddenly Rosemary let the possibility enter her mind that they
might stay another week.</p>

<p>"Not very long," she answered vaguely. "We've been abroad a
long time&#151;we landed in Sicily in March and we've been slowly
working our way north. I got pneumonia making a picture last
January and I've been recuperating."</p>

<p>"Mercy! How did that happen?"</p>

<p>"Well, it was from swimming," Rosemary was rather reluctant at
embarking upon personal revelations. "One day I happened to have
the grippe and didn't know it, and they were taking a scene where
I dove into a canal in Venice. It was a very expensive set, so I
had to dive and dive and dive all morning. Mother had a doctor
right there, but it was no use&#151;I got pneumonia." She changed the
subject determinedly before they could speak. "Do you like it
here&#151;this place?"</p>

<p>"They have to like it," said Abe North slowly. "They invented
it." He turned his noble head slowly so that his eyes rested with
tenderness and affection on the two Divers.</p>

<p>"Oh, did you?"</p>

<p>"This is only the second season that the hotel's been open in
summer," Nicole explained. "We persuaded Gausse to keep on a cook
and a gar√ßon and a chasseur&#151;it paid its way and this year
it's doing even better."</p>

<p>"But you're not in the hotel."</p>

<p>"We built a house, up at Tarmes."</p>

<p>"The theory is," said Dick, arranging an umbrella to clip a
square of sunlight off Rosemary's shoulder, "that all the
northern places, like Deauville, were picked out by Russians and
English who don't mind the cold, while half of us Americans come
from tropical climates&#151;that's why we're beginning to come
here."</p>

<p>The young man of Latin aspect had been turning the pages of
<i>The New</i> <i>York Herald.</i></p>

<p>"Well, what nationality are these people?" he demanded,
suddenly, and read with a slight French intonation, "'Registered
at the Hotel Palace at Vevey are Mr. Pandely Vlasco, Mme.
Bonneasse'&#151;I don't exaggerate&#151;'Corinna Medonca, Mme. Pasche,
Seraphim Tullio, Maria Amalia Roto Mais, Moises Teubel, Mme.
Paragoris, Apostle Alexandre, Yolanda Yosfuglu and Geneveva de
Momus!' She attracts me most&#151;Geneveva de Momus. Almost worth
running up to Vevey to take a look at Geneveva de Momus."</p>

<p>He stood up with sudden restlessness, stretching himself with
one sharp movement. He was a few years younger than Diver or
North. He was tall and his body was hard but overspare save for
the bunched force gathered in his shoulders and upper arms. At
first glance he seemed conventionally handsome&#151;but there was a
faint disgust always in his face which marred the full fierce
lustre of his brown eyes. Yet one remembered them afterward, when
one had forgotten the inability of the mouth to endure boredom
and the young forehead with its furrows of fretful and
unprofitable pain.</p>

<p>"We found some fine ones in the news of Americans last week,"
said Nicole. "Mrs. Evelyn Oyster and&#151;what were the others?"</p>

<p>"There was Mr. S. Flesh," said Diver, getting up also. He took
his rake and began to work seriously at getting small stones out
of the sand.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes&#151;S. Flesh&#151;doesn't he give you the creeps?"</p>

<p>It was quiet alone with Nicole&#151;Rosemary found it even quieter
than with her mother. Abe North and Barban, the Frenchman, were
talking about Morocco, and Nicole having copied her recipe picked
up a piece of sewing. Rosemary examined their appurtenances&#151;four
large parasols that made a canopy of shade, a portable bath house
for dressing, a pneumatic rubber horse, new things that Rosemary
had never seen, from the first burst of luxury manufacturing
after the War, and probably in the hands of the first of
purchasers. She had gathered that they were fashionable people,
but though her mother had brought her up to beware such people as
drones, she did not feel that way here. Even in their absolute
immobility, complete as that of the morning, she felt a purpose,
a working over something, a direction, an act of creation
different from any she had known. Her immature mind made no
speculations upon the nature of their relation to each other, she
was only concerned with their attitude toward herself&#151;but she
perceived the web of some pleasant interrelation, which she
expressed with the thought that they seemed to have a very good
time.</p>

<p>She looked in turn at the three men, temporarily expropriating
them. All three were personable in different ways; all were of a
special gentleness that she felt was part of their lives, past
and future, not circumstanced by events, not at all like the
company manners of actors, and she detected also a far-reaching
delicacy that was different from the rough and ready good
fellowship of directors, who represented the intellectuals in her
life. Actors and directors&#151;those were the only men she had ever
known, those and the heterogeneous, indistinguishable mass of
college boys, interested only in love at first sight, whom she
had met at the Yale prom last fall.</p>

<p>These three were different. Barban was less civilized, more
skeptical and scoffing, his manners were formal, even
perfunctory. Abe North had, under his shyness, a desperate humor
that amused but puzzled her. Her serious nature distrusted its
ability to make a supreme impression on him.</p>

<p>But Dick Diver&#151;he was all complete there. Silently she
admired him. His complexion was reddish and weather-burned, so
was his short hair&#151;a light growth of it rolled down his arms and
hands. His eyes were of a bright, hard blue. His nose was
somewhat pointed and there was never any doubt at whom he was
looking or talking&#151;and this is a flattering attention, for who
looks at us?&#151;glances fall upon us, curious or disinterested,
nothing more. His voice, with some faint Irish melody running
through it, wooed the world, yet she felt the layer of hardness
in him, of self-control and of self-discipline, her own virtues.
Oh, she chose him, and Nicole, lifting her head saw her choose
him, heard the little sigh at the fact that he was already
possessed.</p>

<p>Toward noon the McKiscos, Mrs. Abrams, Mr. Dumphry, and Signor
Campion came on the beach. They had brought a new umbrella that
they set up with side glances toward the Divers, and crept under
with satisfied expressions&#151;all save Mr. McKisco, who remained
derisively without. In his raking Dick had passed near them and
now he returned to the umbrellas.</p>

<p>"The two young men are reading the Book of Etiquette
together," he said in a low voice.</p>

<p>"Planning to mix wit de quality," said Abe.</p>

<p>Mary North, the very tanned young woman whom Rosemary had
encountered the first day on the raft, came in from swimming and
said with a smile that was a rakish gleam:</p>

<p>"So Mr. and Mrs. Neverquiver have arrived."</p>

<p>"They're this man's friends," Nicole reminded her, indicating
Abe. "Why doesn't he go and speak to them? Don't you think
they're attractive?"</p>

<p>"I think they're very attractive," Abe agreed. "I just don't
think they're attractive, that's all."</p>

<p>"Well, I <i>have</i> felt there were too many people on the
beach this summer," Nicole admitted. <i>"Our</i> beach that Dick
made out of a pebble pile." She considered, and then lowering her
voice out of the range of the trio of nannies who sat back under
another umbrella. "Still, they're preferable to those British
last summer who kept shouting about: 'Isn't the sea blue? Isn't
the sky white? Isn't little Nellie's nose red?'"</p>

<p>Rosemary thought she would not like to have Nicole for an
enemy.</p>

<p>"But you didn't see the fight," Nicole continued. "The day
before you came, the married man, the one with the name that
sounds like a substitute for gasoline or butter&#151;"</p>

<p>"McKisco?"</p>

<p>"Yes&#151;well they were having words and she tossed some sand in
his face. So naturally he sat on top of her and rubbed her face
in the sand. We were&#151;electrified. I wanted Dick to
interfere."</p>

<p>"I think," said Dick Diver, staring down abstractedly at the
straw mat, "that I'll go over and invite them to dinner."</p>

<p>"No, you won't," Nicole told him quickly.</p>

<p>"I think it would be a very good thing. They're here&#151;let's
adjust ourselves."</p>

<p>"We're very well adjusted," she insisted, laughing. "I'm not
going to have <i>my</i> nose rubbed in the sand. I'm a mean, hard
woman," she explained to Rosemary, and then raising her voice,
"Children, put on your bathing suits!"</p>

<p>Rosemary felt that this swim would become the typical one of
her life, the one that would always pop up in her memory at the
mention of swimming. Simultaneously the whole party moved toward
the water, super-ready from the long, forced inaction, passing
from the heat to the cool with the gourmandise of a tingling
curry eaten with chilled white wine. The Divers' day was spaced
like the day of the older civilizations to yield the utmost from
the materials at hand, and to give all the transitions their full
value, and she did not know that there would be another
transition presently from the utter absorption of the swim to the
garrulity of the Proven√ßal lunch hour. But again she had
the sense that Dick was taking care of her, and she delighted in
responding to the eventual movement as if it had been an
order.</p>

<p>Nicole handed her husband the curious garment on which she had
been working. He went into the dressing tent and inspired a
commotion by appearing in a moment clad in transparent black lace
drawers. Close inspection revealed that actually they were lined
with flesh-colored cloth.</p>





<p>"Well, if that isn't a pansys trick!" exclaimed Mr. McKisco
contemptuously&#151;then turning quickly to Mr. Dumphry and Mr.
Campion, he added, "Oh, I beg your pardon."</p>

<p>Rosemary bubbled with delight at the trunks. Her
na√Øvet√© responded whole-heartedly to the expensive
simplicity of the Divers, unaware of its complexity and its lack
of innocence, unaware that it was all a selection of quality
rather than quantity from the run of the world's bazaar; and that
the simplicity of behavior also, the nursery-like peace and good
will, the emphasis on the simpler virtues, was part of a
desperate bargain with the gods and had been attained through
struggles she could not have guessed at. At that moment the
Divers represented externally the exact furthermost evolution of
a class, so that most people seemed awkward beside them&#151;in
reality a qualitative change had already set in that was not at
all apparent to Rosemary.</p>

<p>She stood with them as they took sherry and ate crackers. Dick
Diver looked at her with cold blue eyes; his kind, strong mouth
said thoughtfully and deliberately:</p>

<p>"You're the only girl I've seen for a long time that actually
did look like something blooming."</p>





<p>In her mother's lap afterward Rosemary cried and cried.</p>

<p>"I love him, Mother. I'm desperately in love with him&#151;I never
knew I could feel that way about anybody. And he's married and I
like her too&#151;it's just hopeless. Oh, I love him so!"</p>

<p>"I'm curious to meet him."</p>

<p>"She invited us to dinner Friday."</p>

<p>"If you're in love it ought to make you happy. You ought to
laugh."</p>

<p>Rosemary looked up and gave a beautiful little shiver of her
face and laughed. Her mother always had a great influence on
her.</p>
