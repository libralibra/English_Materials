<p class="storyTitle">XIII</p>





<p>With his cap, Dick slapped the snow from his dark blue
ski-suit before going inside. The great hall, its floor
pockmarked by two decades of hobnails, was cleared for the tea
dance, and four-score young Americans, domiciled in schools near
Gstaad, bounced about to the frolic of "Don't Bring Lulu," or
exploded violently with the first percussions of the Charleston.
It was a colony of the young, simple, and expensive&#151;the
<i>Sturmtruppen</i> of the rich were at St. Moritz. Baby Warren
felt that she had made a gesture of renunciation in joining the
Divers here.</p>

<p>Dick picked out the two sisters easily across the delicately
haunted, soft-swaying room&#151;they were poster-like, formidable in
their snow costumes, Nicole's of cerulean blue, Baby's of brick
red. The young Englishman was talking to them; but they were
paying no attention, lulled to the staring point by the
adolescent dance.</p>

<p>Nicole's snow-warm face lighted up further as she saw Dick.
"Where is he?"</p>

<p>"He missed the train&#151;I'm meeting him later." Dick sat down,
swinging a heavy boot over his knee. "You two look very striking
together. Every once in a while I forget we're in the same party
and get a big shock at seeing you."</p>

<p>Baby was a tall, fine-looking woman, deeply engaged in being
almost thirty. Symptomatically she had pulled two men with her
from London, one scarcely down from Cambridge, one old and hard
with Victorian lecheries. Baby had certain spinsters'
characteristics&#151;she was alien from touch, she started if she was
touched suddenly, and such lingering touches as kisses and
embraces slipped directly through the flesh into the forefront of
her consciousness. She made few gestures with her trunk, her body
proper&#151;instead, she stamped her foot and tossed her head in
almost an old-fashioned way. She relished the foretaste of death,
prefigured by the catastrophes of friends&#151;persistently she clung
to the idea of Nicole's tragic destiny.</p>

<p>Baby's younger Englishman had been chaperoning the women down
appropriate inclines and harrowing them on the bob-run. Dick,
having turned an ankle in a too ambitious telemark, loafed
gratefully about the "nursery slope" with the children or drank
kvass with a Russian doctor at the hotel.</p>

<p>"Please be happy, Dick," Nicole urged him. "Why don't you meet
some of these ickle durls and dance with them in the
afternoon?"</p>

<p>"What would I say to them?"</p>

<p>Her low almost harsh voice rose a few notes, simulating a
plaintive coquetry: "Say: 'Ickle durl, oo is de pwettiest sing.'
What do you think you say?"</p>

<p>"I don't like ickle durls. They smell of castile soap and
peppermint. When I dance with them, I feel as if I'm pushing a
baby carriage."</p>

<p>It was a dangerous subject&#151;he was careful, to the point of
self-consciousness, to stare far over the heads of young
maidens.</p>

<p>"There's a lot of business," said Baby. "First place, there's
news from home&#151;the property we used to call the station
property. The railroads only bought the centre of it at first.
Now they've bought the rest, and it belonged to Mother. It's a
question of investing the money."</p>

<p>Pretending to be repelled by this gross turn in the
conversation, the Englishman made for a girl on the floor.
Following him for an instant with the uncertain eyes of an
American girl in the grip of a life-long Anglophilia, Baby
continued defiantly:</p>

<p>"It's a lot of money. It's three hundred thousand apiece. I
keep an eye on my own investments but Nicole doesn't know
anything about securities, and I don't suppose you do
either."</p>

<p>"I've got to meet the train," Dick said evasively.</p>

<p>Outside he inhaled damp snowflakes that he could no longer see
against the darkening sky. Three children sledding past shouted a
warning in some strange language; he heard them yell at the next
bend and a little farther on he heard sleigh-bells coming up the
hill in the dark. The holiday station glittered with expectancy,
boys and girls waiting for new boys and girls, and by the time
the train arrived, Dick had caught the rhythm, and pretended to
Franz Gregorovius that he was clipping off a half-hour from an
endless roll of pleasures. But Franz had some intensity of
purpose at the moment that fought through any superimposition of
mood on Dick's part. "I may get up to Zurich for a day," Dick had
written, "or you can manage to come to Lausanne." Franz had
managed to come all the way to Gstaad.</p>

<p>He was forty. Upon his healthy maturity reposed a set of
pleasant official manners, but he was most at home in a somewhat
stuffy safety from which he could despise the broken rich whom he
re-educated. His scientific heredity might have bequeathed him a
wider world but he seemed to have deliberately chosen the
standpoint of an humbler class, a choice typified by his
selection of a wife. At the hotel Baby Warren made a quick
examination of him, and failing to find any of the hall-marks she
respected, the subtler virtues or courtesies by which the
privileged classes recognized one another, treated him thereafter
with her second manner. Nicole was always a little afraid of him.
Dick liked him, as he liked his friends, without
reservations.</p>

<p>For the evening they were sliding down the hill into the
village, on those little sleds which serve the same purpose as
gondolas do in Venice. Their destination was a hotel with an
old-fashioned Swiss tap-room, wooden and resounding, a room of
clocks, kegs, steins, and antlers. Many parties at long tables
blurred into one great party and ate fondue&#151;a peculiarly
indigestible form of Welsh rarebit, mitigated by hot spiced
wine.</p>

<p>It was jolly in the big room; the younger Englishman remarked
it and Dick conceded that there was no other word. With the pert
heady wine he relaxed and pretended that the world was all put
together again by the gray-haired men of the golden nineties who
shouted old glees at the piano, by the young voices and the
bright costumes toned into the room by the swirling smoke. For a
moment he felt that they were in a ship with landfall just ahead;
in the faces of all the girls was the same innocent expectation
of the possibilities inherent in the situation and the night. He
looked to see if that special girl was there and got an
impression that she was at the table behind them&#151;then he forgot
her and invented a rigmarole and tried to make his party have a
good time.</p>

<p>"I must talk to you," said Franz in English. "I have only
twenty-four hours to spend here."</p>

<p>"I suspected you had something on your mind."</p>

<p>"I have a plan that is&#151;so marvellous." His hand fell upon
Dick's knee. "I have a plan that will be the making of us
two."</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"Dick&#151;there is a clinic we could have together&#151;the old
clinic of Braun on the Zugersee. The plant is all modern except
for a few points. He is sick&#151;he wants to go up in Austria, to
die probably. It is a chance that is just insuperable. You and
me&#151;what a pair! Now don't say anything yet until I finish."</p>

<p>From the yellow glint in Baby's eyes, Dick saw she was
listening.</p>

<p>"We must undertake it together. It would not bind you too
tight&#151;it would give you a base, a laboratory, a centre. You
could stay in residence say no more than half the year, when the
weather is fine. In winter you could go to France or America and
write your texts fresh from clinical experience." He lowered his
voice. "And for the convalescence in your family, there are the
atmosphere and regularity of the clinic at hand." Dick's
expression did not encourage this note so Franz dropped it with
the punctuation of his tongue leaving his lip quickly. "We could
be partners. I the executive manager, you the theoretician, the
brilliant consultant and all that. I know myself&#151;I know I have
no genius and you have. But, in my way, I am thought very
capable; I am utterly competent at the most modern clinical
methods. Sometimes for months I have served as the practical head
of the old clinic. The professor says this plan is excellent, he
advises me to go ahead. He says he is going to live forever, and
work up to the last minute."</p>

<p>Dick formed imaginary pictures of the prospect as a
preliminary to any exercise of judgment.</p>

<p>"What's the financial angle?" he asked.</p>

<p>Franz threw up his chin, his eyebrows, the transient wrinkles
of his forehead, his hands, his elbows, his shoulders; he
strained up the muscles of his legs, so that the cloth of his
trousers bulged, pushed up his heart into his throat and his
voice into the roof of his mouth.</p>

<p>"There we have it! Money!" he bewailed. "I have little money.
The price in American money is two hundred thousand dollars. The
innovation&#151;ary&#151;" he tasted the coinage doubtfully, "&#151;steps,
that you will agree are necessary, will cost twenty thousand
dollars American. But the clinic is a gold mine&#151;I tell you, I
haven't seen the books. For an investment of two hundred and
twenty thousand dollars we have an assured income of&#151;"</p>

<p>Baby's curiosity was such that Dick brought her into the
conversation.</p>

<p>"In your experience, Baby," he demanded, "have you found that
when a European wants to see an American <i>very</i> pressingly
it is invariably something concerned with money?"</p>

<p>"What is it?" she said innocently.</p>

<p>"This young Privat-dozent thinks that he and I ought to launch
into big business and try to attract nervous breakdowns from
America."</p>

<p>Worried, Franz stared at Baby as Dick continued:</p>

<p>"But who are we, Franz? You bear a big name and I've written
two textbooks. Is that enough to attract anybody? And I haven't
got that much money&#151;I haven't got a tenth of it." Franz smiled
cynically. "Honestly I haven't. Nicole and Baby are rich as
Croesus but I haven't managed to get my hands on any of it
yet."</p>

<p>They were all listening now&#151;Dick wondered if the girl at the
table behind was listening too. The idea attracted him. He
decided to let Baby speak for him, as one often lets women raise
their voices over issues that are not in their hands. Baby became
suddenly her grandfather, cool and experimental.</p>

<p>"I think it's a suggestion you ought to consider, Dick. I
don't know what Doctor Gregory was saying&#151;but it seems to
me&#151;"</p>

<p>Behind him the girl had leaned forward into a smoke ring and
was picking up something from the floor. Nicole's face, fitted
into his own across the table&#151;her beauty, tentatively nesting
and posing, flowed into his love, ever braced to protect it.</p>

<p>"Consider it, Dick," Franz urged excitedly. "When one writes
on psychiatry, one should have actual clinical contacts. Jung
writes, Bleuler writes, Freud writes, Forel writes, Adler
writes&#151;also they are in constant contact with mental
disorder."</p>

<p>"Dick has me," laughed Nicole. "I should think that'd be
enough mental disorder for one man."</p>

<p>"That's different," said Franz cautiously.</p>

<p>Baby was thinking that if Nicole lived beside a clinic she
would always feel quite safe about her.</p>

<p>"We must think it over carefully," she said.</p>

<p>Though amused at her insolence, Dick did not encourage it.</p>

<p>"The decision concerns me, Baby," he said gently. "It's nice
of you to want to buy me a clinic."</p>

<p>Realizing she had meddled, Baby withdrew hurriedly:</p>

<p>"Of course, it's entirely your affair."</p>

<p>"A thing as important as this will take weeks to decide. I
wonder how I like the picture of Nicole and me anchored to
Zurich&#151;" He turned to Franz, anticipating: "&#151;I know. Zurich has
a gashouse and running water and electric light&#151;I lived there
three years."</p>

<p>"I will leave you to think it over," said Franz. "I am
confident&#151;"</p>

<p>One hundred pair of five-pound boots had begun to clump toward
the door, and they joined the press. Outside in the crisp
moonlight, Dick saw the girl tying her sled to one of the sleighs
ahead. They piled into their own sleigh and at the crisp-cracking
whips the horses strained, breasting the dark air. Past them
figures ran and scrambled, the younger ones shoving each other
from sleds and runners, landing in the soft snow, then panting
after the horses to drop exhausted on a sled or wail that they
were abandoned. On either side the fields were beneficently
tranquil; the space through which the cavalcade moved was high
and limitless. In the country there was less noise as though they
were all listening atavistically for wolves in the wide snow.</p>

<p>In Saanen, they poured into the municipal dance, crowded with
cow herders, hotel servants, shop-keepers, ski teachers, guides,
tourists, peasants. To come into the warm enclosed place after
the pantheistic animal feeling without, was to reassume some
absurd and impressive knightly name, as thunderous as spurred
boots in war, as football cleats on the cement of a locker-room
floor. There was conventional yodelling, and the familiar rhythm
of it separated Dick from what he had first found romantic in the
scene. At first he thought it was because he had hounded the girl
out of his consciousness; then it came to him under the form of
what Baby had said: "We must think it over carefully&#151;" and the
unsaid lines back of that: "We own you, and you'll admit it
sooner or later. It is absurd to keep up the pretense of
independence."</p>

<p>It had been years since Dick had bottled up malice against a
creature&#151;since freshman year at New Haven when he had come upon
a popular essay about "mental hygiene." Now he lost his temper at
Baby and simultaneously tried to coop it up within him, resenting
her cold rich insolence. It would be hundreds of years before any
emergent Amazons would ever grasp the fact that a man is
vulnerable only in his pride, but delicate as Humpty-Dumpty once
that is meddled with&#151;though some of them paid the fact a
cautious lip-service. Doctor Diver's profession of sorting the
broken shells of another sort of egg had given him a dread of
breakage. But:</p>

<p>"There's too much good manners," he said on the way back to
Gstaad in the smooth sleigh.</p>

<p>"Well, I think that's nice," said Baby.</p>

<p>"No, it isn't," he insisted to the anonymous bundle of fur.
"Good manners are an admission that everybody is so tender that
they have to be handled with gloves. Now, human respect&#151;you
don't call a man a coward or a liar lightly, but if you spend
your life sparing people's feelings and feeding their vanity, you
get so you can't distinguish what <i>should</i> be respected in
them."</p>

<p>"I think Americans take their manners rather seriously," said
the elder Englishman.</p>

<p>"I guess so," said Dick. "My father had the kind of manners he
inherited from the days when you shot first and apologized
afterward. Men armed&#151;why, you Europeans haven't carried arms in
civil life since the beginning of the eighteenth century&#151;"</p>

<p>"Not actually, perhaps&#151;"</p>

<p>"Not <i>act</i>ually. Not really."</p>

<p>"Dick, you've always had such beautiful manners," said Baby
conciliatingly.</p>

<p>The women were regarding him across the zoo of robes with some
alarm. The younger Englishman did not understand&#151;he was one of
the kind who were always jumping around cornices and balconies,
as if they thought they were in the rigging of a ship&#151;and filled
the ride to the hotel with a preposterous story about a boxing
match with his best friend in which they loved and bruised each
other for an hour, always with great reserve. Dick became
facetious.</p>

<p>"So every time he hit you you considered him an even better
friend?"</p>

<p>"I respected him more."</p>

<p>"It's the premise I don't understand. You and your best friend
scrap about a trivial matter&#151;"</p>

<p>"If you don't understand, I can't explain it to you," said the
young Englishman coldly.</p>

<p>&#151;This is what I'll get if I begin saying what I think, Dick
said to himself.</p>

<p>He was ashamed at baiting the man, realizing that the
absurdity of the story rested in the immaturity of the attitude
combined with the sophisticated method of its narration.</p>

<p>The carnival spirit was strong and they went with the crowd
into the grill, where a Tunisian barman manipulated the
illumination in a counterpoint, whose other melody was the moon
off the ice rink staring in the big windows. In that light, Dick
found the girl devitalized, and uninteresting&#151;he turned from her
to enjoy the darkness, the cigarette points going green and
silver when the lights shone red, the band of white that fell
across the dancers as the door to the bar was opened and
closed.</p>

<p>"Now tell me, Franz," he demanded, "do you think after sitting
up all night drinking beer, you can go back and convince your
patients that you have any character? Don't you think they'll see
you're a gastropath?"</p>

<p>"I'm going to bed," Nicole announced. Dick accompanied her to
the door of the elevator.</p>

<p>"I'd come with you but I must show Franz that I'm not intended
for a clinician."</p>

<p>Nicole walked into the elevator.</p>

<p>"Baby has lots of common sense," she said meditatively.</p>

<p>"Baby is one of&#151;"</p>

<p>The door slashed shut&#151;facing a mechanical hum, Dick finished
the sentence in his mind, "&#151;Baby is a trivial, selfish
woman."</p>

<p>But two days later, sleighing to the station with Franz, Dick
admitted that he thought favorably upon the matter.</p>

<p>"We're beginning to turn in a circle," he admitted. "Living on
this scale, there's an unavoidable series of strains, and Nicole
doesn't survive them. The pastoral quality down on the summer
Riviera is all changing anyhow&#151;next year they'll have a
Season."</p>

<p>They passed the crisp green rinks where Wiener waltzes blared
and the colors of many mountain schools flashed against the
pale-blue skies.</p>

<p>"&#151;I hope we'll be able to do it, Franz. There's nobody I'd
rather try it with than you&#151;"</p>

<p>Good-by, Gstaad! Good-by, fresh faces, cold sweet flowers,
flakes in the darkness. Good-by, Gstaad, good-by!</p>
