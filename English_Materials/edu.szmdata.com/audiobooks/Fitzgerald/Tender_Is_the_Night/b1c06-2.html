<p class="storyTitle">VI</p>





<p>Feeling good from the rosy wine at lunch, Nicole Diver folded
her arms high enough for the artificial camellia on her shoulder
to touch her cheek, and went out into her lovely grassless
garden. The garden was bounded on one side by the house, from
which it flowed and into which it ran, on two sides by the old
village, and on the last by the cliff falling by ledges to the
sea.</p>

<p>Along the walls on the village side all was dusty, the
wriggling vines, the lemon and eucalyptus trees, the casual
wheel-barrow, left only a moment since, but already grown into
the path, atrophied and faintly rotten. Nicole was invariably
somewhat surprised that by turning in the other direction past a
bed of peonies she walked into an area so green and cool that the
leaves and petals were curled with tender damp.</p>

<p>Knotted at her throat she wore a lilac scarf that even in the
achromatic sunshine cast its color up to her face and down around
her moving feet in a lilac shadow. Her face was hard, almost
stern, save for the soft gleam of piteous doubt that looked from
her green eyes. Her once fair hair had darkened, but she was
lovelier now at twenty-four than she had been at eighteen, when
her hair was brighter than she.</p>

<p>Following a walk marked by an intangible mist of bloom that
followed the white border stones she came to a space overlooking
the sea where there were lanterns asleep in the fig trees and a
big table and wicker chairs and a great market umbrella from
Sienna, all gathered about an enormous pine, the biggest tree in
the garden. She paused there a moment, looking absently at a
growth of nasturtiums and iris tangled at its foot, as though
sprung from a careless handful of seeds, listening to the plaints
and accusations of some nursery squabble in the house. When this
died away on the summer air, she walked on, between kaleidoscopic
peonies massed in pink clouds, black and brown tulips and fragile
mauve-stemmed roses, transparent like sugar flowers in a
confectioner's window&#151;until, as if the scherzo of color could
reach no further intensity, it broke off suddenly in mid-air, and
moist steps went down to a level five feet below.</p>

<p>Here there was a well with the boarding around it dank and
slippery even on the brightest days. She went up the stairs on
the other side and into the vegetable garden; she walked rather
quickly; she liked to be active, though at times she gave an
impression of repose that was at once static and evocative. This
was because she knew few words and believed in none, and in the
world she was rather silent, contributing just her share of
urbane humor with a precision that approached meagreness. But at
the moment when strangers tended to grow uncomfortable in the
presence of this economy she would seize the topic and rush off
with it, feverishly surprised with herself&#151;then bring it back
and relinquish it abruptly, almost timidly, like an obedient
retriever, having been adequate and something more.</p>

<p>As she stood in the fuzzy green light of the vegetable garden,
Dick crossed the path ahead of her going to his work house.
Nicole waited silently till he had passed; then she went on
through lines of prospective salads to a little menagerie where
pigeons and rabbits and a parrot made a medley of insolent noises
at her. Descending to another ledge she reached a low, curved
wall and looked down seven hundred feet to the Mediterranean
Sea.</p>

<p>She stood in the ancient hill village of Tarmes. The villa and
its grounds were made out of a row of peasant dwellings that
abutted on the cliff&#151;five small houses had been combined to make
the house and four destroyed to make the garden. The exterior
walls were untouched so that from the road far below it was
indistinguishable from the violet gray mass of the town.</p>

<p>For a moment Nicole stood looking down at the Mediterranean
but there was nothing to do with that, even with her tireless
hands. Presently Dick came out of his one-room house carrying a
telescope and looked east toward Cannes. In a moment Nicole swam
into his field of vision, whereupon he disappeared into his house
and came out with a megaphone. He had many light mechanical
devices.</p>

<p>"Nicole," he shouted, "I forgot to tell you that as a final
apostolic gesture I invited Mrs. Abrams, the woman with the white
hair."</p>

<p>"I suspected it. It's an outrage."</p>

<p>The ease with which her reply reached him seemed to belittle
his megaphone, so she raised her voice and called, "Can you hear
me?"</p>

<p>"Yes." He lowered the megaphone and then raised it stubbornly.
"I'm going to invite some more people too. I'm going to invite
the two young men."</p>

<p>"All right," she agreed placidly.</p>

<p>"I want to give a really <i>bad</i> party. I mean it. I want
to give a party where there's a brawl and seductions and people
going home with their feelings hurt and women passed out in the
cabinet de toilette. You wait and see."</p>

<p>He went back into his house and Nicole saw that one of his
most characteristic moods was upon him, the excitement that swept
everyone up into it and was inevitably followed by his own form
of melancholy, which he never displayed but at which she guessed.
This excitement about things reached an intensity out of
proportion to their importance, generating a really extraordinary
virtuosity with people. Save among a few of the tough-minded and
perennially suspicious, he had the power of arousing a fascinated
and uncritical love. The reaction came when he realized the waste
and extravagance involved. He sometimes looked back with awe at
the carnivals of affection he had given, as a general might gaze
upon a massacre he had ordered to satisfy an impersonal blood
lust.</p>

<p>But to be included in Dick Diver's world for a while was a
remarkable experience: people believed he made special
reservations about them, recognizing the proud uniqueness of
their destinies, buried under the compromises of how many years.
He won everyone quickly with an exquisite consideration and a
politeness that moved so fast and intuitively that it could be
examined only in its effect. Then, without caution, lest the
first bloom of the relation wither, he opened the gate to his
amusing world. So long as they subscribed to it completely, their
happiness was his preoccupation, but at the first flicker of
doubt as to its all-inclusiveness he evaporated before their
eyes, leaving little communicable memory of what he had said or
done.</p>

<p>At eight-thirty that evening he came out to meet his first
guests, his coat carried rather ceremoniously, rather
promisingly, in his hand, like a toreador's cape. It was
characteristic that after greeting Rosemary and her mother he
waited for them to speak first, as if to allow them the
reassurance of their own voices in new surroundings.</p>

<p>To resume Rosemary's point of view it should be said that,
under the spell of the climb to Tarmes and the fresher air, she
and her mother looked about appreciatively. Just as the personal
qualities of extraordinary people can make themselves plain in an
unaccustomed change of expression, so the intensely calculated
perfection of Villa Diana transpired all at once through such
minute failures as the chance apparition of a maid in the
background or the perversity of a cork. While the first guests
arrived bringing with them the excitement of the night, the
domestic activity of the day receded past them gently, symbolized
by the Diver children and their governess still at supper on the
terrace.</p>

<p>"What a beautiful garden!" Mrs. Speers exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Nicole's garden," said Dick. "She won't let it alone&#151;she
nags it all the time, worries about its diseases. Any day now I
expect to have her come down with Powdery Mildew or Fly Speck, or
Late Blight." He pointed his forefinger decisively at Rosemary,
saying with a lightness seeming to conceal a paternal interest,
"I'm going to save your reason&#151;I'm going to give you a hat to
wear on the beach."</p>

<p>He turned them from the garden to the terrace, where he poured
a cocktail. Earl Brady arrived, discovering Rosemary with
surprise. His manner was softer than at the studio, as if his
differentness had been put on at the gate, and Rosemary,
comparing him instantly with Dick Diver, swung sharply toward the
latter. In comparison Earl Brady seemed faintly gross, faintly
ill-bred; once more, though, she felt an electric response to his
person.</p>

<p>He spoke familiarly to the children who were getting up from
their outdoor supper.</p>

<p>"Hello, Lanier, how about a song? Will you and Topsy sing me a
song?"</p>

<p>"What shall we sing?" agreed the little boy, with the odd
chanting accent of American children brought up in France.</p>

<p>"That song about 'Mon Ami Pierrot.'"</p>

<p>Brother and sister stood side by side without
self-consciousness and their voices soared sweet and shrill upon
the evening air.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>"Au clair de la lune<br>
 Mon Ami Pierrot<br>
 Prête-moi ta plume<br>
 Pour écrire un mot<br>
 Ma chandelle est morte<br>
 Je n'ai plus de feu<br>
 Ouvre-moi ta porte<br>
 Pour l'amour de Dieu."</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The singing ceased and the children, their faces aglow with
the late sunshine, stood smiling calmly at their success.
Rosemary was thinking that the Villa Diana was the centre of the
world. On such a stage some memorable thing was sure to happen.
She lighted up higher as the gate tinkled open and the rest of
the guests arrived in a body&#151;the McKiscos, Mrs. Abrams, Mr.
Dumphry, and Mr. Campion came up to the terrace.</p>

<p>Rosemary had a sharp feeling of disappointment&#151;she looked
quickly at Dick, as though to ask an explanation of this
incongruous mingling. But there was nothing unusual in his
expression. He greeted his new guests with a proud bearing and an
obvious deference to their infinite and unknown possibilities.
She believed in him so much that presently she accepted the
rightness of the McKiscos' presence as if she had expected to
meet them all along.</p>

<p>"I've met you in Paris," McKisco said to Abe North, who with
his wife had arrived on their heels, "in fact I've met you
twice."</p>

<p>"Yes, I remember," Abe said.</p>

<p>"Then where was it?" demanded McKisco, not content to let well
enough alone.</p>

<p>"Why, I think&#151;" Abe got tired of the game, "I can't
remember."</p>

<p>The interchange filled a pause and Rosemary's instinct was
that something tactful should be said by somebody, but Dick made
no attempt to break up the grouping formed by these late
arrivals, not even to disarm Mrs. McKisco of her air of
supercilious amusement. He did not solve this social problem
because he knew it was not of importance at the moment and would
solve itself. He was saving his newness for a larger effort,
waiting a more significant moment for his guests to be conscious
of a good time.</p>

<p>Rosemary stood beside Tommy Barban&#151;he was in a particularly
scornful mood and there seemed to be some special stimulus
working upon him. He was leaving in the morning.</p>

<p>"Going home?"</p>

<p>"Home? I have no home. I am going to a war."</p>

<p>"What war?"</p>

<p>"What war? Any war. I haven't seen a paper lately but I
suppose there's a war&#151;there always is."</p>

<p>"Don't you care what you fight for?"</p>

<p>"Not at all&#151;so long as I'm well treated. When I'm in a rut I
come to see the Divers, because then I know that in a few weeks
I'll want to go to war."</p>

<p>Rosemary stiffened.</p>

<p>"You like the Divers," she reminded him.</p>

<p>"Of course&#151;especially her&#151;but they make me want to go to
war."</p>

<p>She considered this, to no avail. The Divers made her want to
stay near them forever.</p>

<p>"You're half American," she said, as if that should solve the
problem.</p>

<p>"Also I'm half French, and I was educated in England and since
I was eighteen I've worn the uniforms of eight countries. But I
hope I did not give you the impression that I am not fond of the
Divers&#151;I am, especially of Nicole."</p>

<p>"How could any one help it?" she said simply.</p>

<p>She felt far from him. The undertone of his words repelled her
and she withdrew her adoration for the Divers from the profanity
of his bitterness. She was glad he was not next to her at dinner
and she was still thinking of his words "especially her" as they
moved toward the table in the garden.</p>

<p>For a moment now she was beside Dick Diver on the path.
Alongside his hard, neat brightness everything faded into the
surety that he knew everything. For a year, which was forever,
she had had money and a certain celebrity and contact with the
celebrated, and these latter had presented themselves merely as
powerful enlargements of the people with whom the doctor's widow
and her daughter had associated in a hôtel-pension in
Paris. Rosemary was a romantic and her career had not provided
many satisfactory opportunities on that score. Her mother, with
the idea of a career for Rosemary, would not tolerate any such
spurious substitutes as the excitations available on all sides,
and indeed Rosemary was already beyond that&#151;she was In the
movies but not at all At them. So when she had seen approval of
Dick Diver in her mother's face it meant that he was "the real
thing"; it meant permission to go as far as she could.</p>

<p>"I was watching you," he said, and she knew he meant it.
"We've grown very fond of you."</p>

<p>"I fell in love with you the first time I saw you," she said
quietly. He pretended not to have heard, as if the compliment
were purely formal.</p>

<p>"New friends," he said, as if it were an important point, "can
often have a better time together than old friends."</p>

<p>With that remark, which she did not understand precisely, she
found herself at the table, picked out by slowly emerging lights
against the dark dusk. A chord of delight struck inside her when
she saw that Dick had taken her mother on his right hand; for
herself she was between Luis Campion and Brady.</p>

<p>Surcharged with her emotion she turned to Brady with the
intention of confiding in him, but at her first mention of Dick a
hard-boiled sparkle in his eyes gave her to understand that he
refused the fatherly office. In turn she was equally firm when he
tried to monopolize her hand, so they talked shop or rather she
listened while he talked shop, her polite eyes never leaving his
face, but her mind was so definitely elsewhere that she felt he
must guess the fact. Intermittently she caught the gist of his
sentences and supplied the rest from her subconscious, as one
picks up the striking of a clock in the middle with only the
rhythm of the first uncounted strokes lingering in the mind.</p>
