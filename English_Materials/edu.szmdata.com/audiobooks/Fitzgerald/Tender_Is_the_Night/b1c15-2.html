<p>"What is it you are giving up?" demanded Rosemary, facing Dick
earnestly in the taxi.</p>

<p>"Nothing of importance."</p>

<p>"Are you a scientist?"</p>

<p>"I'm a doctor of medicine."</p>

<p>"Oh-h!" she smiled delightedly. "My father was a doctor too.
Then why don't you&#151;" she stopped.</p>

<p>"There's no mystery. I didn't disgrace myself at the height of
my career, and hide away on the Riviera. I'm just not practising.
You can't tell, I'll probably practise again some day."</p>

<p>Rosemary put up her face quietly to be kissed. He looked at
her for a moment as if he didn't understand. Then holding her in
the hollow of his arm he rubbed his cheek against her cheek's
softness, and then looked down at her for another long
moment.</p>

<p>"Such a lovely child," he said gravely.</p>

<p>She smiled up at him; her hands playing conventionally with
the lapels of his coat. "I'm in love with you and Nicole.
Actually that's my secret&#151;I can't even talk about you to anybody
because I don't want any more people to know how wonderful you
are. Honestly&#151;I love you and Nicole&#151;I do."</p>

<p>&#151;So many times he had heard this&#151;even the formula was the
same.</p>

<p>Suddenly she came toward him, her youth vanishing as she
passed inside the focus of his eyes and he had kissed her
breathlessly as if she were any age at all. Then she lay back
against his arm and sighed.</p>

<p>"I've decided to give you up," she said.</p>

<p>Dick started&#151;had he said anything to imply that she possessed
any part of him?</p>

<p>"But that's very mean," he managed to say lightly, "just when
I was getting interested."</p>

<p>"I've loved you so&#151;" As if it had been for years. She was
weeping a little now. "I've loved you so-o-o."</p>

<p>Then he should have laughed, but he heard himself saying, "Not
only are you beautiful but you are somehow on the grand scale.
Everything you do, like pretending to be in love or pretending to
be shy gets across."</p>

<p>In the dark cave of the taxi, fragrant with the perfume
Rosemary had bought with Nicole, she came close again, clinging
to him. He kissed her without enjoying it. He knew that there was
passion there, but there was no shadow of it in her eyes or on
her mouth; there was a faint spray of champagne on her breath.
She clung nearer desperately and once more he kissed her and was
chilled by the innocence of her kiss, by the glance that at the
moment of contact looked beyond him out into the darkness of the
night, the darkness of the world. She did not know yet that
splendor is something in the heart; at the moment when she
realized that and melted into the passion of the universe he
could take her without question or regret.</p>

<p>Her room in the hotel was diagonally across from theirs and
nearer the elevator. When they reached the door she said
suddenly:</p>

<p>"I know you don't love me&#151;I don't expect it. But you said I
should have told you about my birthday. Well, I did, and now for
my birthday present I want you to come into my room a minute
while I tell you something. Just one minute."</p>

<p>They went in and he closed the door, and Rosemary stood close
to him, not touching him. The night had drawn the color from her
face&#151;she was pale as pale now, she was a white carnation left
after a dance.</p>

<p>"When you smile&#151;" He had recovered his paternal attitude,
perhaps because of Nicole's silent proximity, "I always think
I'll see a gap where you've lost some baby teeth."</p>

<p>But he was too late&#151;she came close up against him with a
forlorn whisper.</p>

<p>"Take me."</p>

<p>"Take you where?"</p>

<p>Astonishment froze him rigid.</p>

<p>"Go on," she whispered. "Oh, please go on, whatever they do. I
don't care if I don't like it&#151;I never expected to&#151;I've always
hated to think about it but now I don't. I want you to."</p>

<p>She was astonished at herself&#151;she had never imagined she
could talk like that. She was calling on things she had read,
seen, dreamed through a decade of convent hours. Suddenly she
knew too that it was one of her greatest r√¥les and she
flung herself into it more passionately.</p>

<p>"This is not as it should be," Dick deliberated. "Isn't it
just the champagne? Let's more or less forget it."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, <i>now</i>. I want you to do it now, take me, show
me, I'm absolutely yours and I want to be."</p>

<p>"For one thing, have you thought how much it would hurt
Nicole?"</p>

<p>"She won't know&#151;this won't have anything to do with her."</p>

<p>He continued kindly.</p>

<p>"Then there's the fact that I love Nicole."</p>

<p>"But you can love more than just one person, can't you? Like I
love Mother and I love you&#151;more. I love you more now."</p>

<p>"&#151;the fourth place you're not in love with me but you might
be afterwards, and that would begin your life with a terrible
mess."</p>

<p>"No, I promise I'll never see you again. I'll get Mother and
go to America right away."</p>

<p>He dismissed this. He was remembering too vividly the youth
and freshness of her lips. He took another tone.</p>

<p>"You're just in that mood."</p>

<p>"Oh, please, I don't care even if I had a baby. I could go
into Mexico like a girl at the studio. Oh, this is so different
from anything I ever thought&#151;I used to hate it when they kissed
me seriously." He saw she was still under the impression that it
must happen. "Some of them had great big teeth, but you're all
different and beautiful. I want you to do it."</p>

<p>"I believe you think people just kiss some way and you want me
to kiss you."</p>

<p>"Oh, don't tease me&#151;I'm not a baby. I know you're not in love
with me." She was suddenly humble and quiet. "I didn't expect
that much. I know I must seem just nothing to you."</p>

<p>"Nonsense. But you seem young to me." His thoughts added,
"&#151;there'd be so much to teach you."</p>

<p>Rosemary waited, breathing eagerly till Dick said: "And lastly
things aren't arranged so that this could be as you want."</p>

<p>Her face drooped with dismay and disappointment and Dick said
automatically, "We'll have to simply&#151;" He stopped himself,
followed her to the bed, sat down beside her while she wept. He
was suddenly confused, not about the ethics of the matter, for
the impossibility of it was sheerly indicated from all angles but
simply confused, and for a moment his usual grace, the tensile
strength of his balance, was absent.</p>

<p>"I knew you wouldn't," she sobbed. "It was just a forlorn
hope."</p>

<p>He stood up.</p>

<p>"Good night, child. This is a damn shame. Let's drop it out of
the picture." He gave her two lines of hospital patter to go to
sleep on. "So many people are going to love you and it might be
nice to meet your first love all intact, emotionally too. That's
an old-fashioned idea, isn't it?" She looked up at him as he took
a step toward the door; she looked at him without the slightest
idea as to what was in his head, she saw him take another step in
slow motion, turn and look at her again, and she wanted for a
moment to hold him and devour him, wanted his mouth, his ears,
his coat collar, wanted to surround him and engulf him; she saw
his hand fall on the doorknob. Then she gave up and sank back on
the bed. When the door closed she got up and went to the mirror,
where she began brushing her hair, sniffling a little. One
hundred and fifty strokes Rosemary gave it, as usual, then a
hundred and fifty more. She brushed it until her arm ached, then
she changed arms and went on brushing. . . .</p>
