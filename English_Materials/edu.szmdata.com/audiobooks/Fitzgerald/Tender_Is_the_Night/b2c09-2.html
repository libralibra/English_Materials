<p>They were waiting for him and incomplete without him. He was
still the incalculable element; Miss Warren and the young Italian
wore their anticipation as obviously as Nicole. The salon of the
hotel, a room of fabled acoustics, was stripped for dancing but
there was a small gallery of Englishwomen of a certain age, with
neckbands, dyed hair and faces powdered pinkish gray; and of
American women of a certain age, with snowy-white
transformations, black dresses and lips of cherry red. Miss
Warren and Marmora were at a corner table&#151;Nicole was diagonally
across from them forty yards away, and as Dick arrived he heard
her voice:</p>

<p><i>"Can you hear me? I'm speaking naturally."</i></p>

<p>"Perfectly,"</p>

<p><i>"Hello, Doctor Diver."</i></p>

<p>"What's this?"</p>

<p><i>"You realize the people in the centre of the floor can't
hear what I say, but you can?"</i></p>

<p>"A waiter told us about it," said Miss Warren. "Corner to
corner&#151;it's like wireless."</p>

<p>It was exciting up on the mountain, like a ship at sea.
Presently Marmora's parents joined them. They treated the Warrens
with respect&#151;Dick gathered that their fortunes had something to
do with a bank in Milan that had something to do with the Warren
fortunes. But Baby Warren wanted to talk to Dick, wanted to talk
to him with the impetus that sent her out vagrantly toward all
new men, as though she were on an inelastic tether and considered
that she might as well get to the end of it as soon as possible.
She crossed and recrossed her knees frequently in the manner of
tall restless virgins.</p>

<p>"&#151;Nicole told me that you took part care of her, and had a
lot to do with her getting well. What I can't understand is what
<i>we're</i> supposed to do&#151;they were so indefinite at the
sanitarium; they only told me she ought to be natural and gay. I
knew the Marmoras were up here so I asked Tino to meet us at the
funicular. And you see what happens&#151;the very first thing Nicole
has him crawling over the sides of the car as if they were both
insane&#151;"</p>

<p>"That was absolutely normal," Dick laughed. "I'd call it a
good sign. They were showing off for each other."</p>

<p>"But how can <i>I</i> tell? Before I knew it, almost in front
of my eyes, she had her hair cut off, in Zurich, because of a
picture in 'Vanity Fair.'"</p>

<p>"That's all right. She's a schizoid&#151;a permanent eccentric.
You can't change that."</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"Just what I said&#151;an eccentric."</p>

<p>"Well, how can any one tell what's eccentric and what's
crazy?"</p>

<p>"Nothing is going to be crazy&#151;Nicole is all fresh and happy,
you needn't be afraid."</p>

<p>Baby shifted her knees about&#151;she was a compendium of all the
discontented women who had loved Byron a hundred years before,
yet, in spite of the tragic affair with the guards' officer there
was something wooden and onanistic about her.</p>

<p>"I don't mind the responsibility," she declared, "but I'm in
the air. We've never had anything like this in the family
before&#151;we know Nicole had some shock and my opinion is it was
about a boy, but we don't really know. Father says he would have
shot him if he could have found out."</p>

<p>The orchestra was playing "Poor Butterfly"; young Marmora was
dancing with his mother. It was a tune new enough to them all.
Listening, and watching Nicole's shoulders as she chattered to
the elder Marmora, whose hair was dashed with white like a piano
keyboard, Dick thought of the shoulders of a violin, and then he
thought of the dishonor, the secret. Oh, butterfly&#151;the moments
pass into hours&#151;</p>

<p>"Actually <i>I</i> have a plan," Baby continued with
apologetic hardness. "It may seem absolutely impractical to you
but they say Nicole will need to be looked after for a few years.
I don't know whether you know Chicago or not&#151;"</p>

<p>"I don't."</p>

<p>"Well, there's a North Side and a South Side and they're very
much separated. The North Side is chic and all that, and we've
always lived over there, at least for many years, but lots of old
families, old Chicago families, if you know what I mean, still
live on the South Side. The University is there. I mean it's
stuffy to some people, but anyhow it's different from the North
Side. I don't know whether you understand."</p>

<p>He nodded. With some concentration he had been able to follow
her.</p>

<p>"Now of course we have lots of connections there&#151;Father
controls certain chairs and fellowships and so forth at the
University, and I thought if we took Nicole home and threw her
with that crowd&#151;you see she's quite musical and speaks all these
languages&#151;what could be better in her condition than if she fell
in love with some good doctor&#151;"</p>

<p>A burst of hilarity surged up in Dick, the Warrens were going
to buy Nicole a doctor&#151;You got a nice doctor you can let us use?
There was no use worrying about Nicole when they were in the
position of being able to buy her a nice young doctor, the paint
scarcely dry on him.</p>

<p>"But how about the doctor?" he said automatically.</p>

<p>"There must be many who'd jump at the chance."</p>

<p>The dancers were back, but Baby whispered quickly:</p>

<p>"This is the sort of thing I mean. Now where is Nicole&#151;she's
gone off somewhere. Is she upstairs in her room? What am <i>I</i>
supposed to do? I never know whether it's something innocent or
whether I ought to go find her."</p>

<p>"Perhaps she just wants to be by herself&#151;people living alone
get used to loneliness." Seeing that Miss Warren was not
listening he stopped. "I'll take a look around."</p>

<p>For a moment all the outdoors shut in with mist was like
spring with the curtains drawn. Life was gathered near the hotel.
Dick passed some cellar windows where bus boys sat on bunks and
played cards over a litre of Spanish wine. As he approached the
promenade, the stars began to come through the white crests of
the high Alps. On the horseshoe walk overlooking the lake Nicole
was the figure motionless between two lamp stands, and he
approached silently across the grass. She turned to him with an
expression of: "Here <i>you</i> are," and for a moment he was
sorry he had come.</p>

<p>"Your sister wondered."</p>

<p>"Oh!" She was accustomed to being watched. With an effort she
explained herself: "Sometimes I get a little&#151;it gets a little
too much. I've lived so quietly. To-night that music was too
much. It made me want to cry&#151;"</p>

<p>"I understand."</p>

<p>"This has been an awfully exciting day."</p>

<p>"I know."</p>

<p>"I don't want to do anything anti-social&#151;I've caused
everybody enough trouble. But to-night I wanted to get away."</p>

<p>It occurred to Dick suddenly, as it might occur to a dying man
that he had forgotten to tell where his will was, that Nicole had
been "re-educated" by Dohmler and the ghostly generations behind
him; it occurred to him also that there would be so much she
would have to be told. But having recorded this wisdom within
himself, he yielded to the insistent face-value of the situation
and said:</p>

<p>"You're a nice person&#151;just keep using your own judgment about
yourself."</p>

<p>"You like me?"</p>

<p>"Of course."</p>

<p>"Would you&#151;" They were strolling along toward the dim end of
the horseshoe, two hundred yards ahead. "If I hadn't been sick
would you&#151;I mean, would I have been the sort of girl you might
have&#151;oh, slush, you know what I mean."</p>

<p>He was in for it now, possessed by a vast irrationality. She
was so near that he felt his breathing change but again his
training came to his aid in a boy's laugh and a trite remark.</p>

<p>"You're teasing yourself, my dear. Once I knew a man who fell
in love with his nurse&#151;" The anecdote rambled on, punctuated by
their footsteps. Suddenly Nicole interrupted in succinct
Chicagoese: "Bull!"</p>

<p>"That's a very vulgar expression."</p>

<p>"What about it?" she flared up. "You don't think I've got any
common sense&#151;before I was sick I didn't have any, but I have
now. And if I don't know you're the most attractive man I ever
met you must think I'm still crazy. It's my hard luck, all
right&#151;but don't pretend I don't <i>know</i>&#151;I know everything
about you and me."</p>

<p>Dick was at an additional disadvantage. He remembered the
statement of the elder Miss Warren as to the young doctors that
could be purchased in the intellectual stockyards of the South
Side of Chicago, and he hardened for a moment. "You're a fetching
kid, but I couldn't fall in love."</p>

<p>"You won't give me a chance."</p>

<p><i>"What!"</i></p>

<p>The impertinence, the right to invade implied, astounded him.
Short of anarchy he could not think of any chance that Nicole
Warren deserved.</p>

<p>"Give me a chance now."</p>

<p>The voice fell low, sank into her breast and stretched the
tight bodice over her heart as she came up close. He felt the
young lips, her body sighing in relief against the arm growing
stronger to hold her. There were now no more plans than if Dick
had arbitrarily made some indissoluble mixture, with atoms joined
and inseparable; you could throw it all out but never again could
they fit back into atomic scale. As he held her and tasted her,
and as she curved in further and further toward him, with her own
lips, new to herself, drowned and engulfed in love, yet solaced
and triumphant, he was thankful to have an existence at all, if
only as a reflection in her wet eyes.</p>

<p>"My God," he gasped, "you're fun to kiss."</p>

<p>That was talk, but Nicole had a better hold on him now and she
held it; she turned coquette and walked away, leaving him as
suspended as in the funicular of the afternoon. She felt: There,
that'll show him, how conceited; how he could do with me; oh,
wasn't it wonderful! I've got him, he's mine. Now in the sequence
came flight, but it was all so sweet and new that she dawdled,
wanting to draw all of it in.</p>

<p>She shivered suddenly. Two thousand feet below she saw the
necklace and bracelet of lights that were Montreux and Vevey,
beyond them a dim pendant of Lausanne. From down there somewhere
ascended a faint sound of dance music. Nicole was up in her head
now, cool as cool, trying to collate the sentimentalities of her
childhood, as deliberate as a man getting drunk after battle. But
she was still afraid of Dick, who stood near her, leaning,
characteristically, against the iron fence that rimmed the
horseshoe; and this prompted her to say: "I can remember how I
stood waiting for you in the garden&#151;holding all my self in my
arms like a basket of flowers. It was that to me anyhow&#151;I
thought I was sweet&#151;waiting to hand that basket to you."</p>

<p>He breathed over her shoulder and turned her insistently
about; she kissed him several times, her face getting big every
time she came close, her hands holding him by the shoulders.</p>

<p>"It's raining hard."</p>

<p>Suddenly there was a booming from the wine slopes across the
lake; cannons were shooting at hail-bearing clouds in order to
break them. The lights of the promenade went off, went on again.
Then the storm came swiftly, first falling from the heavens, then
doubly falling in torrents from the mountains and washing loud
down the roads and stone ditches; with it came a dark,
frightening sky and savage filaments of lightning and
world-splitting thunder, while ragged, destroying clouds fled
along past the hotel. Mountains and lake disappeared&#151;the hotel
crouched amid tumult, chaos and darkness.</p>

<p>By this time Dick and Nicole had reached the vestibule, where
Baby Warren and the three Marmoras were anxiously awaiting them.
It was exciting coming out of the wet fog&#151;with the doors
banging, to stand and laugh and quiver with emotion, wind in
their ears and rain on their clothes. Now in the ballroom the
orchestra was playing a Strauss waltz, high and confusing.</p>

<p>. . . For Doctor Diver to marry a mental patient? How did it
happen? Where did it begin?</p>

<p>"Won't you come back after you've changed?" Baby Warren asked
after a close scrutiny.</p>

<p>"I haven't got any change, except some shorts."</p>

<p>As he trudged up to his hotel in a borrowed raincoat he kept
laughing derisively in his throat.</p>

<p><i>"Big</i> chance&#151;oh, yes. My God!&#151;they decided to buy a
doctor? Well, they better stick to whoever they've got in
Chicago." Revolted by his harshness he made amends to Nicole,
remembering that nothing had ever felt so young as her lips,
remembering rain like tears shed for him that lay upon her softly
shining porcelain cheeks . . . the silence of the storm ceasing
woke him about three o'clock and he went to the window. Her
beauty climbed the rolling slope, it came into the room, rustling
ghostlike through the curtains. . . .</p>

<p>. . . He climbed two thousand meters to Rochers de Naye the
following morning, amused by the fact that his conductor of the
day before was using his day off to climb also.</p>

<p>Then Dick descended all the way to Montreux for a swim, got
back to his hotel in time for dinner. Two notes awaited him.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>"I'm not ashamed about last night&#151;it was the nicest thing
that ever happened to me and even if I never saw you again, Mon
Capitaine, I would be glad it happened."</p>
</blockquote>



<p>That was disarming enough&#151;the heavy shade of Dohmler
retreated as Dick opened the second envelope:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>DEAR DOCTOR DIVER: I phoned but you were out. I wonder if I
may ask you a great big favor. Unforeseen circumstances call me
back to Paris, and I find I can make better time by way of
Lausanne. Can you let Nicole ride as far as Zurich with you,
since you are going back Monday? and drop her at the sanitarium?
Is this too much to ask?</p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>BETH EVAN WARREN.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Dick was furious&#151;Miss Warren had known he had a bicycle with
him; yet she had so phrased her note that it was impossible to
refuse. Throw us together! Sweet propinquity and the Warren
money!</p>

<p>He was wrong; Baby Warren had no such intentions. She had
looked Dick over with worldly eyes, she had measured him with the
warped rule of an Anglophile and found him wanting&#151;in spite of
the fact that she found him toothsome. But for her he was too
"intellectual" and she pigeonholed him with a shabby-snobby crowd
she had once known in London&#151;he put himself out too much to be
really of the correct stuff. She could not see how he could be
made into her idea of an aristocrat.</p>

<p>In addition to that he was stubborn&#151;she had seen him leave
her conversation and get down behind his eyes in that odd way
that people did, half a dozen times. She had not liked Nicole's
free and easy manner as a child and now she was sensibly
habituated to thinking of her as a "gone coon"; and anyhow Doctor
Diver was not the sort of medical man she could envisage in the
family.</p>

<p>She only wanted to use him innocently as a convenience.</p>

<p>But her request had the effect that Dick assumed she desired.
A ride in a train can be a terrible, heavy-hearted or comic
thing; it can be a trial flight; it can be a prefiguration of
another journey just as a given day with a friend can be long,
from the taste of hurry in the morning up to the realization of
both being hungry and taking food together. Then comes the
afternoon with the journey fading and dying, but quickening again
at the end. Dick was sad to see Nicole's meagre joy; yet it was a
relief for her, going back to the only home she knew. They made
no love that day, but when he left her outside the sad door on
the Zurichsee and she turned and looked at him he knew her
problem was one they had together for good now.</p>
