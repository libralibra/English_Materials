<p class="storyTitle">XII</p>





<p>They were at Voisins waiting for Nicole, six of them,
Rosemary, the Norths, Dick Diver and two young French musicians.
They were looking over the other patrons of the restaurant to see
if they had repose&#151;Dick said no American men had any repose,
except himself, and they were seeking an example to confront him
with. Things looked black for them&#151;not a man had come into the
restaurant for ten minutes without raising his hand to his
face.</p>

<p>"We ought never to have given up waxed mustaches," said Abe.
"Nevertheless Dick isn't the <i>only</i> man with repose&#151;"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I am."</p>

<p>"&#151;but he may be the only sober man with repose."</p>

<p>A well-dressed American had come in with two women who swooped
and fluttered unselfconsciously around a table. Suddenly, he
perceived that he was being watched&#151;whereupon his hand rose
spasmodically and arranged a phantom bulge in his necktie. In
another unseated party a man endlessly patted his shaven cheek
with his palm, and his companion mechanically raised and lowered
the stub of a cold cigar. The luckier ones fingered eyeglasses
and facial hair, the unequipped stroked blank mouths, or even
pulled desperately at the lobes of their ears.</p>

<p>A well-known general came in, and Abe, counting on the man's
first year at West Point&#151;that year during which no cadet can
resign and from which none ever recovers&#151;made a bet with Dick of
five dollars.</p>

<p>His hands hanging naturally at his sides, the general waited
to be seated. Once his arms swung suddenly backward like a
jumper's and Dick said, "Ah!" supposing he had lost control, but
the general recovered and they breathed again&#151;the agony was
nearly over, the garçon was pulling out his chair . .
.</p>

<p>With a touch of fury the conqueror shot up his hand and
scratched his gray immaculate head.</p>

<p>"You see," said Dick smugly, "I'm the only one."</p>

<p>Rosemary was quite sure of it and Dick, realizing that he
never had a better audience, made the group into so bright a unit
that Rosemary felt an impatient disregard for all who were not at
their table. They had been two days in Paris but actually they
were still under the beach umbrella. When, as at the ball of the
Corps des Pages the night before, the surroundings seemed
formidable to Rosemary, who had yet to attend a Mayfair party in
Hollywood, Dick would bring the scene within range by greeting a
few people, a sort of selection&#151;the Divers seemed to have a
large acquaintance, but it was always as if the person had not
seen them for a long, long time, and was utterly bowled over,
"Why, where do you <i>keep</i> yourselves?"&#151;and then re-create
the unity of his own party by destroying the outsiders softly but
permanently with an ironic coup de grâce. Presently
Rosemary seemed to have known those people herself in some
deplorable past, and then got on to them, rejected them,
discarded them.</p>

<p>Their own party was overwhelmingly American and sometimes
scarcely American at all. It was themselves he gave back to them,
blurred by the compromises of how many years.</p>

<p>Into the dark, smoky restaurant, smelling of the rich raw
foods on the buffet, slid Nicole's sky-blue suit like a stray
segment of the weather outside. Seeing from their eyes how
beautiful she was, she thanked them with a smile of radiant
appreciation. They were all very nice people for a while, very
courteous and all that. Then they grew tired of it and they were
funny and bitter, and finally they made a lot of plans. They
laughed at things that they would not remember clearly
afterward&#151;laughed a lot and the men drank three bottles of wine.
The trio of women at the table were representative of the
enormous flux of American life. Nicole was the granddaughter of a
self-made American capitalist and the granddaughter of a Count of
the House of Lippe Weissenfeld. Mary North was the daughter of a
journeyman paper-hanger and a descendant of President Tyler.
Rosemary was from the middle of the middle class, catapulted by
her mother onto the uncharted heights of Hollywood. Their point
of resemblance to each other and their difference from so many
American women, lay in the fact that they were all happy to exist
in a man's world&#151;they preserved their individuality through men
and not by opposition to them. They would all three have made
alternatively good courtesans or good wives not by the accident
of birth but through the greater accident of finding their man or
not finding him.</p>

<p>So Rosemary found it a pleasant party, that luncheon, nicer in
that there were only seven people, about the limit of a good
party. Perhaps, too, the fact that she was new to their world
acted as a sort of catalytic agent to precipitate out all their
old reservations about one another. After the table broke up, a
waiter directed Rosemary back into the dark hinterland of all
French restaurants, where she looked up a phone number by a dim
orange bulb, and called Franco-American Films. Sure, they had a
print of "Daddy's Girl"&#151;it was out for the moment, but they
would run it off later in the week for her at 341 Rue des Saintes
Anges&#151;ask for Mr. Crowder.</p>

<p>The semi-booth gave on the vestiaire and as Rosemary hung up
the receiver she heard two low voices not five feet from her on
the other side of a row of coats.</p>

<p>"&#151;So you love me?"</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>do</i> I!"</p>

<p>It Was Nicole&#151;Rosemary hesitated in the door of the
booth&#151;then she heard Dick say:</p>

<p>"I want you terribly&#151;let's go to the hotel now." Nicole gave
a little gasping sigh. For a moment the words conveyed nothing at
all to Rosemary&#151;but the tone did. The vast secretiveness of it
vibrated to herself.</p>

<p>"I want you."</p>

<p>"I'll be at the hotel at four."</p>

<p>Rosemary stood breathless as the voices moved away. She was at
first even astonished&#151;she had seen them in their relation to
each other as people without personal exigencies&#151;as something
cooler. Now a strong current of emotion flowed through her,
profound and unidentified. She did not know whether she was
attracted or repelled, but only that she was deeply moved. It
made her feel very alone as she went back into the restaurant,
but it was touching to look in upon, and the passionate gratitude
of Nicole's "Oh, <i>do</i> I!" echoed in her mind. The particular
mood of the passage she had witnessed lay ahead of her; but
however far she was from it her stomach told her it was all
right&#151;she had none of the aversion she had felt in the playing
of certain love scenes in pictures.</p>

<p>Being far away from it she nevertheless irrevocably
participated in it now, and shopping with Nicole she was much
more conscious of the assignation than Nicole herself. She looked
at Nicole in a new way, estimating her attractions. Certainly she
was the most attractive woman Rosemary had ever met&#151;with her
hardness, her devotions and loyalties, and a certain elusiveness,
which Rosemary, thinking now through her mother's middle-class
mind, associated with her attitude about money. Rosemary spent
money she had earned&#151;she was here in Europe due to the fact that
she had gone in the pool six times that January day with her
temperature roving from 99° in the early morning to 103°,
when her mother stopped it.</p>

<p>With Nicole's help Rosemary bought two dresses and two hats
and four pairs of shoes with her money. Nicole bought from a
great list that ran two pages, and bought the things in the
windows besides. Everything she liked that she couldn't possibly
use herself, she bought as a present for a friend. She bought
colored beads, folding beach cushions, artificial flowers, honey,
a guest bed, bags, scarfs, love birds, miniatures for a doll's
house and three yards of some new cloth the color of prawns. She
bought a dozen bathing suits, a rubber alligator, a travelling
chess set of gold and ivory, big linen handkerchiefs for Abe, two
chamois leather jackets of kingfisher blue and burning bush from
Hermes&#151;bought all these things not a bit like a high-class
courtesan buying underwear and jewels, which were after all
professional equipment and insurance&#151;but with an entirely
different point of view. Nicole was the product of much ingenuity
and toil. For her sake trains began their run at Chicago and
traversed the round belly of the continent to California; chicle
factories fumed and link belts grew link by link in factories;
men mixed toothpaste in vats and drew mouthwash out of copper
hogsheads; girls canned tomatoes quickly in August or worked
rudely at the Five-and-Tens on Christmas Eve; half-breed Indians
toiled on Brazilian coffee plantations and dreamers were muscled
out of patent rights in new tractors&#151;these were some of the
people who gave a tithe to Nicole, and as the whole system swayed
and thundered onward it lent a feverish bloom to such processes
of hers as wholesale buying, like the flush of a fireman's face
holding his post before a spreading blaze. She illustrated very
simple principles, containing in herself her own doom, but
illustrated them so accurately that there was grace in the
procedure, and presently Rosemary would try to imitate it.</p>

<p>It was almost four. Nicole stood in a shop with a love bird on
her shoulder, and had one of her infrequent outbursts of
speech.</p>

<p>"Well, what if you hadn't gone in that pool that day&#151;I
sometimes wonder about such things. Just before the war we were
in Berlin&#151;I was thirteen, it was just before Mother died. My
sister was going to a court ball and she had three of the royal
princes on her dance card, all arranged by a chamberlain and
everything. Half an hour before she was going to start she had a
side ache and a high fever. The doctor said it was appendicitis
and she ought to be operated on. But Mother had her plans made,
so Baby went to the ball and danced till two with an ice pack
strapped on under her evening dress. She was operated on at seven
o'clock next morning."</p>

<p>It was good to be hard, then; all nice people were hard on
themselves. But it was four o'clock and Rosemary kept thinking of
Dick waiting for Nicole now at the hotel. She must go there, she
must not make him wait for her. She kept thinking, "Why don't you
go?" and then suddenly, "Or let me go if you don't want to." But
Nicole went to one more place to buy corsages for them both and
sent one to Mary North. Only then she seemed to remember and with
sudden abstraction she signalled for a taxi.</p>

<p>"Good-by," said Nicole. "We had fun, didn't we?"</p>

<p>"Loads of fun," said Rosemary. It was more difficult than she
thought and her whole self protested as Nicole drove away.</p>
