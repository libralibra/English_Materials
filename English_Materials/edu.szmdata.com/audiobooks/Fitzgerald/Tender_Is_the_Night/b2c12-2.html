<p class="storyTitle">XII</p>





<p>He found Nicole in the garden with her arms folded high on her
shoulders. She looked at him with straight gray eyes, with a
child's searching wonder.</p>

<p>"I went to Cannes," he said. "I ran into Mrs. Speers. She's
leaving to-morrow. She wanted to come up and say good-by to you,
but I slew the idea."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry. I'd like to have seen her. I like her."</p>

<p>"Who else do you think I saw&#151;Bartholomew Tailor."</p>

<p>"You didn't."</p>

<p>"I couldn't have missed that face of his, the old experienced
weasel. He was looking over the ground for Ciro's
Menagerie&#151;they'll all be down next year. I suspected Mrs. Abrams
was a sort of outpost."</p>

<p>"And Baby was outraged the first summer we came here."</p>

<p>"They don't really give a damn where they are, so I don't see
why they don't stay and freeze in Deauville."</p>

<p>"Can't we start rumors about cholera or something?"</p>

<p>"I told Bartholomew that some categories died off like flies
here&#151;I told him the life of a suck was as short as the life of a
machine-gunner in the war."</p>

<p>"You didn't."</p>

<p>"No, I didn't," he admitted. "He was very pleasant. It was a
beautiful sight, he and I shaking hands there on the boulevard.
The meeting of Sigmund Freud and Ward McAllister."</p>

<p>Dick didn't want to talk&#151;he wanted to be alone so that his
thoughts about work and the future would overpower his thoughts
of love and to-day. Nicole knew about it but only darkly and
tragically, hating him a little in an animal way, yet wanting to
rub against his shoulder.</p>

<p>"The darling," Dick said lightly.</p>

<p>He went into the house, forgetting something he wanted to do
there, and then remembering it was the piano. He sat down
whistling and played by ear:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>"Just picture you upon my knee<br>
 With tea for two and two for tea<br>
 And me for you and you for me&#151;"</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Through the melody flowed a sudden realization that Nicole,
hearing it, would guess quickly at a nostalgia for the past
fortnight. He broke off with a casual chord and left the
piano.</p>

<p>It was hard to know where to go. He glanced about the house
that Nicole had made, that Nicole's grandfather had paid for. He
owned only his work house and the ground on which it stood. Out
of three thousand a year and what dribbled in from his
publications he paid for his clothes and personal expenses, for
cellar charges, and for Lanier's education, so far confined to a
nurse's wage. Never had a move been contemplated without Dick's
figuring his share. Living rather ascetically, travelling
third-class when he was alone, with the cheapest wine, and good
care of his clothes, and penalizing himself for any
extravagances, he maintained a qualified financial independence.
After a certain point, though, it was difficult&#151;again and again
it was necessary to decide together as to the uses to which
Nicole's money should be put. Naturally Nicole, wanting to own
him, wanting him to stand still forever, encouraged any slackness
on his part, and in multiplying ways he was constantly inundated
by a trickling of goods and money. The inception of the idea of
the cliff villa which they had elaborated as a fantasy one day
was a typical example of the forces divorcing them from the first
simple arrangements in Zurich.</p>

<p>"Wouldn't it be fun if&#151;" it had been; and then, "Won't it be
fun when&#151;"</p>

<p>It was not so much fun. His work became confused with Nicole's
problems; in addition, her income had increased so fast of late
that it seemed to belittle his work. Also, for the purpose of her
cure, he had for many years pretended to a rigid domesticity from
which he was drifting away, and this pretense became more arduous
in this effortless immobility, in which he was inevitably
subjected to microscopic examination. When Dick could no longer
play what he wanted to play on the piano, it was an indication
that life was being refined down to a point. He stayed in the big
room a long time listening to the buzz of the electric clock,
listening to time.</p>





<p>In November the waves grew black and dashed over the sea wall
onto the shore road&#151;such summer life as had survived disappeared
and the beaches were melancholy and desolate under the mistral
and rain. Gausse's Hotel was closed for repairs and enlargement
and the scaffolding of the summer Casino at Juan les Pins grew
larger and more formidable. Going into Cannes or Nice, Dick and
Nicole met new people&#151;members of orchestras, restaurateurs,
horticultural enthusiasts, shipbuilders&#151;for Dick had bought an
old dinghy&#151;and members of the Syndicat d'Initiative. They knew
their servants well and gave thought to the children's education.
In December, Nicole seemed well-knit again; when a month had
passed without tension, without the tight mouth, the unmotivated
smile, the unfathomable remark, they went to the Swiss Alps for
the Christmas holidays.</p>
