<p>In Zurich in September Doctor Diver had tea with Baby
Warren.</p>

<p>"I think it's ill advised," she said, "I'm not sure I truly
understand your motives."</p>

<p>"Don't let's be unpleasant."</p>

<p>"After all I'm Nicole's sister."</p>

<p>"That doesn't give you the right to be unpleasant." It
irritated Dick that he knew so much that he could not tell her.
"Nicole's rich, but that doesn't make me an adventurer."</p>

<p>"That's just it," complained Baby stubbornly. "Nicole's
rich."</p>

<p>"Just how much money has she got?" he asked.</p>

<p>She started; and with a silent laugh he continued, "You see
how silly this is? I'd rather talk to some man in your
family&#151;"</p>

<p>"Everything's been left to me," she persisted. "It isn't we
think you're an adventurer. We don't know who you are."</p>

<p>"I'm a doctor of medicine," he said. "My father is a
clergyman, now retired. We lived in Buffalo and my past is open
to investigation. I went to New Haven; afterward I was a Rhodes
scholar. My great-grandfather was Governor of North Carolina and
I'm a direct descendant of Mad Anthony Wayne."</p>

<p>"Who was Mad Anthony Wayne?" Baby asked suspiciously.</p>

<p>"Mad Anthony Wayne?"</p>

<p>"I think there's enough madness in this affair."</p>

<p>He shook his head hopelessly, just as Nicole came out on the
hotel terrace and looked around for them.</p>

<p>"He was too mad to leave as much money as Marshall Field," he
said.</p>

<p>"That's all very well&#151;"</p>

<p>Baby was right and she knew it. Face to face, her father would
have it on almost any clergyman. They were an American ducal
family without a title&#151;the very name written in a hotel
register, signed to an introduction, used in a difficult
situation, caused a psychological metamorphosis in people, and in
return this change had crystallized her own sense of position.
She knew these facts from the English, who had known them for
over two hundred years. But she did not know that twice Dick had
come close to flinging the marriage in her face. All that saved
it this time was Nicole finding their table and glowing away,
white and fresh and new in the September afternoon.</p>





<p>How do you do, lawyer. We're going to Como tomorrow for a week
and then back to Zurich. That's why I wanted you and sister to
settle this, because it doesn't matter to us how much I'm
allowed. We're going to live very quietly in Zurich for two years
and Dick has enough to take care of us. No, Baby, I'm more
practical than you think&#151;It's only for clothes and things I'll
need it. . . . Why, that's more than&#151;can the estate really
afford to give me all that? I know I'll never manage to spend it.
Do you have that much? Why do you have more&#151;is it because I'm
supposed to be incompetent? All right, let my share pile up then.
. . . No, Dick refuses to have anything whatever to do with it.
I'll have to feel bloated for us both. . . . Baby, you have no
more idea of what Dick is like than, than&#151;Now where do I sign?
Oh, I'm sorry.</p>

<p>. . . Isn't it funny and lonely being together, Dick. No place
to go except close. Shall we just love and love? Ah, but I love
the most, and I can tell when you're away from me, even a little.
I think it's wonderful to be just like everybody else, to reach
out and find you all warm beside me in the bed.</p>

<p>. . . If you will kindly call my husband at the hospital. Yes,
the little book is selling everywhere&#151;they want it published in
six languages. I was to do the French translation but I'm tired
these days&#151;I'm afraid of falling, I'm so heavy and clumsy&#151;like
a broken roly-poly that can't stand up straight. The cold
stethoscope against my heart and my strongest feeling "Je m'en
fiche de tout."&#151;Oh, that poor woman in the hospital with the
blue baby, much better dead. Isn't it fine there are three of us
now?</p>

<p>. . . That seems unreasonable, Dick&#151;we have every reason for
taking the bigger apartment. Why should we penalize ourselves
just because there's more Warren money than Diver money. Oh,
thank you, cameriere, but we've changed our minds. This English
clergyman tells us that your wine here in Orvieto is excellent.
It doesn't travel? That must be why we have never heard of it,
because we love wine.</p>

<p>The lakes are sunk in the brown clay and the slopes have all
the creases of a belly. The photographer gave us the picture of
me, my hair limp over the rail on the boat to Capri. "Good-by,
Blue Grotte," sang the boatman, "come again soo-oon." And
afterward tracing down the hot sinister shin of the Italian boot
with the wind soughing around those eerie castles, the dead
watching from up on those hills.</p>

<p>. . . This ship is nice, with our heels hitting the deck
together. This is the blowy corner and each time we turn it I
slant forward against the wind and pull my coat together without
losing step with Dick. We are chanting nonsense:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>"Oh&#151;oh&#151;oh&#151;oh<br>
 Other flamingoes than me,<br>
 Oh&#151;oh&#151;oh&#151;oh<br>
 Other flamingoes than me&#151;"</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Life is fun with Dick&#151;the people in deck chairs look at us,
and a woman is trying to hear what we are singing. Dick is tired
of singing it, so go on alone, Dick. You will walk differently
alone, dear, through a thicker atmosphere, forcing your way
through the shadows of chairs, through the dripping smoke of the
funnels. You will feel your own reflection sliding along the eyes
of those who look at you. You are no longer insulated; but I
suppose you must touch life in order to spring from it.</p>

<p>Sitting on the stanchion of this life-boat I look seaward and
let my hair blow and shine. I am motionless against the sky and
the boat is made to carry my form onward into the blue obscurity
of the future, I am Pallas Athene carved reverently on the front
of a galley. The waters are lapping in the public toilets and the
agate green foliage of spray changes and complains about the
stern.</p>

<p>. . . We travelled a lot that year&#151;from Woolloomooloo Bay to
Biskra. On the edge of the Sahara we ran into a plague of locusts
and the chauffeur explained kindly that they were bumble-bees.
The sky was low at night, full of the presence of a strange and
watchful God. Oh, the poor little naked Ouled Naïl; the
night was noisy with drums from Senegal and flutes and whining
camels, and the natives pattering about in shoes made of old
automobile tires.</p>

<p>But I was gone again by that time&#151;trains and beaches they
were all one. That was why he took me travelling but after my
second child, my little girl, Topsy, was born everything got dark
again.</p>

<p>. . . If I could get word to my husband who has seen fit to
desert me here, to leave me in the hands of incompetents. You
tell me my baby is black&#151;that's farcical, that's very cheap. We
went to Africa merely to see Timgad, since my principal interest
in life is archeology. I am tired of knowing nothing and being
reminded of it all the time.</p>

<p>. . . When I get well I want to be a fine person like you,
Dick&#151;I would study medicine except it's too late. We must spend
my money and have a house&#151;I'm tired of apartments and waiting
for you. You're bored with Zurich and you can't find time for
writing here and you say that it's a confession of weakness for a
scientist not to write. And I'll look over the whole field of
knowledge and pick out something and really know about it, so
I'll have it to hang on to if I go to pieces again. You'll help
me, Dick, so I won't feel so guilty. We'll live near a warm beach
where we can be brown and young together.</p>

<p>. . . This is going to be Dick's work house. Oh, the idea came
to us both at the same moment. We had passed Tarmes a dozen times
and we rode up here and found the houses empty, except two
stables. When we bought we acted through a Frenchman but the navy
sent spies up here in no time when they found that Americans had
bought part of a hill village. They looked for cannons all
through the building material, and finally Baby had to twitch
wires for us at the <i>Affaires Etrangères</i> in
Paris.</p>

<p>No one comes to the Riviera in summer, so we expect to have a
few guests and to work. There are some French people
here&#151;Mistinguet last week, surprised to find the hotel open, and
Picasso and the man who wrote <i>Pas sur la Bouche.</i></p>

<p>. . . Dick, why did you register Mr. and Mrs. Diver instead of
Doctor and Mrs. Diver? I just wondered&#151;it just floated through
my mind.&#151;You've taught me that work is everything and I believe
you. You used to say a man knows things and when he stops knowing
things he's like anybody else, and the thing is to get power
before he stops knowing things. If you want to turn things
topsy-turvy, all right, but must your Nicole follow you walking
on her hands, darling?</p>

<p>. . . Tommy says I am silent. Since I was well the first time
I talked a lot to Dick late at night, both of us sitting up in
bed and lighting cigarettes, then diving down afterward out of
the blue dawn and into the pillows, to keep the light from our
eyes. Sometimes I sing, and play with the animals, and I have a
few friends too&#151;Mary, for instance. When Mary and I talk neither
of us listens to the other. Talk is men. When I talk I say to
myself that I am probably Dick. Already I have even been my son,
remembering how wise and slow he is. Sometimes I am Doctor
Dohmler and one time I may even be an aspect of you, Tommy
Barban. Tommy is in love with me, I think, but gently,
reassuringly. Enough, though, so that he and Dick have begun to
disapprove of each other. All in all, everything has never gone
better. I am among friends who like me. I am here on this
tranquil beach with my husband and two children. Everything is
all right&#151;if I can finish translating this damn recipe for
chicken a la Maryland into French. My toes feel warm in the
sand.</p>

<p>"Yes, I'll look. More new people&#151;oh, that girl&#151;yes. Who did
you say she looked like. . . . No, I haven't, we don't get much
chance to see the new American pictures over here. Rosemary who?
Well, we're getting very fashionable for July&#151;seems very
peculiar to me. Yes, she's lovely, but there can be too many
people."</p>
