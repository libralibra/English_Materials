<p>At two o'clock that night the phone woke Nicole and she heard
Dick answer it from what they called the restless bed, in the
next room.</p>

<p>"Oui, oui . . . mais à qui est-ce-que je parle? . . .
Oui . . ." His voice woke up with surprise. "But can I speak to
one of the ladies, Sir the Officer? They are both ladies of the
very highest prominence, ladies of connections that might cause
political complications of the most serious. . . . It is a fact,
I swear to you. . . . Very well, you will see."</p>

<p>He got up and, as he absorbed the situation, his
self-knowledge assured him that he would undertake to deal with
it&#151;the old fatal pleasingness, the old forceful charm, swept
back with its cry of "Use me!" He would have to go fix this thing
that he didn't care a damn about, because it had early become a
habit to be loved, perhaps from the moment when he had realized
that he was the last hope of a decaying clan. On an almost
parallel occasion, back in Dohmler's clinic on the
Zürichsee, realizing this power, he had made his choice,
chosen Ophelia, chosen the sweet poison and drunk it. Wanting
above all to be brave and kind, he had wanted, even more than
that, to be loved. So it had been. So it would ever be, he saw,
simultaneously with the slow archaic tinkle from the phone box as
he rang off.</p>

<p>There was a long pause. Nicole called, "What is it? Who is
it?"</p>

<p>Dick had begun to dress even as he hung up the phone.</p>

<p>"It's the poste de police in Antibes&#151;they're holding Mary
North and that Sibley-Biers. It's something serious&#151;the agent
wouldn't tell me; he kept saying 'pas de mortes&#151;pas
d'automobiles' but he implied it was just about everything
else."</p>

<p>"Why on earth did they call on <i>you?</i> It sounds very
peculiar to me."</p>

<p>"They've got to get out on bail to save their faces; and only
some property owner in the Alpes Maritimes can give bail."</p>

<p>"They had their nerve."</p>

<p>"I don't mind. However I'll pick up Gausse at the hotel&#151;"</p>

<p>Nicole stayed awake after he had departed wondering what
offense they could have committed; then she slept. A little after
three when Dick came in she sat up stark awake saying, "What?" as
if to a character in her dream.</p>

<p>"It was an extraordinary story&#151;" Dick said. He sat on the
foot of her bed, telling her how he had roused old Gausse from an
Alsatian coma, told him to clean out his cash drawer, and driven
with him to the police station.</p>

<p>"I don't like to do something for that Anglaise," Gausse
grumbled.</p>

<p>Mary North and Lady Caroline, dressed in the costume of French
sailors, lounged on a bench outside the two dingy cells. The
latter had the outraged air of a Briton who momentarily expected
the Mediterranean fleet to steam up to her assistance. Mary
Minghetti was in a condition of panic and collapse&#151;she literally
flung herself at Dick's stomach as though that were the point of
greatest association, imploring him to do something. Meanwhile
the chief of police explained the matter to Gausse who listened
to each word with reluctance, divided between being properly
appreciative of the officer's narrative gift and showing that, as
the perfect servant, the story had no shocking effect on him. "It
was merely a lark," said Lady Caroline with scorn. "We were
pretending to be sailors on leave, and we picked up two silly
girls. They got the wind up and made a rotten scene in a lodging
house."</p>

<p>Dick nodded gravely, looking at the stone floor, like a priest
in the confessional&#151;he was torn between a tendency to ironic
laughter and another tendency to order fifty stripes of the cat
and a fortnight of bread and water. The lack, in Lady Caroline's
face, of any sense of evil, except the evil wrought by cowardly
Provençal girls and stupid police, confounded him; yet he
had long concluded that certain classes of English people lived
upon a concentrated essence of the anti-social that, in
comparison, reduced the gorgings of New York to something like a
child contracting indigestion from ice cream.</p>

<p>"I've got to get out before Hosain hears about this," Mary
pleaded. "Dick, you can always arrange things&#151;you always could.
Tell 'em we'll go right home, tell 'em we'll pay anything."</p>

<p>"I shall not," said Lady Caroline disdainfully. "Not a
shilling. But I shall jolly well find out what the Consulate in
Cannes has to say about this."</p>

<p>"No, no!" insisted Mary. "We've got to get out to-night."</p>

<p>"I'll see what I can do," said Dick, and added, "but money
will certainly have to change hands." Looking at them as though
they were the innocents that he knew they were not, he shook his
head: "Of all the crazy stunts!"</p>

<p>Lady Caroline smiled complacently.</p>

<p>"You're an insanity doctor, aren't you? You ought to be able
to help us&#151;and Gausse has <i>got</i> to!"</p>

<p>At this point Dick went aside with Gausse and talked over the
old man's findings. The affair was more serious than had been
indicated&#151;one of the girls whom they had picked up was of a
respectable family. The family were furious, or pretended to be;
a settlement would have to be made with them. The other one, a
girl of the port, could be more easily dealt with. There were
French statutes that would make conviction punishable by
imprisonment or, at the very least, public expulsion from the
country. In addition to the difficulties, there was a growing
difference in tolerance between such townspeople as benefited by
the foreign colony and the ones who were annoyed by the
consequent rise of prices. Gausse, having summarized the
situation, turned it over to Dick. Dick called the chief of
police into conference.</p>

<p>"Now you know that the French government wants to encourage
American touring&#151;so much so that in Paris this summer there's an
order that Americans can't be arrested except for the most
serious offenses."</p>

<p>"This is serious enough, my God."</p>

<p>"But look now&#151;you have their Cartes d'Identité?"</p>

<p>"They had none. They had nothing&#151;two hundred francs and some
rings. Not even shoe-laces that they could have hung themselves
with!"</p>

<p>Relieved that there had been no Cartes d'Identité Dick
continued.</p>

<p>"The Italian Countess is still an American citizen. She is the
grand-daughter&#151;" he told a string of lies slowly and
portentously, "of John D. Rockefeller Mellon. You have heard of
him?"</p>

<p>"Yes, oh heavens, yes. You mistake me for a nobody?"</p>

<p>"In addition she is the niece of Lord Henry Ford and so
connected with the Renault and Citroën companies&#151;" He
thought he had better stop here. However the sincerity of his
voice had begun to affect the officer, so he continued: "To
arrest her is just as if you arrested a great royalty of England.
It might mean&#151;War!"</p>

<p>"But how about the Englishwoman?"</p>

<p>"I'm coming to that. She is affianced to the brother of the
Prince of Wales&#151;the Duke of Buckingham."</p>

<p>"She will be an exquisite bride for him."</p>

<p>"Now we are prepared to give&#151;" Dick calculated quickly, "one
thousand francs to each of the girls&#151;and an additional thousand
to the father of the 'serious' one. Also two thousand in
addition, for you to distribute as you think best&#151;" he shrugged
his shoulders, "&#151;among the men who made the arrest, the
lodging-house keeper and so forth. I shall hand you the five
thousand and expect you to do the negotiating immediately. Then
they can be released on bail on some charge like disturbing the
peace, and whatever fine there is will be paid before the
magistrate tomorrow&#151;by messenger."</p>

<p>Before the officer spoke Dick saw by his expression that it
would be all right. The man said hesitantly, "I have made no
entry because they have no Cartes d'Identité. I must
see&#151;give me the money."</p>

<p>An hour later Dick and M. Gausse dropped the women by the
Majestic Hotel, where Lady Caroline's chauffeur slept in her
landaulet.</p>

<p>"Remember," said Dick, "you owe Monsieur Gausse a hundred
dollars a piece."</p>

<p>"All right," Mary agreed, "I'll give him a check
to-morrow&#151;and something more."</p>

<p>"Not I!" Startled, they all turned to Lady Caroline, who, now
entirely recovered, was swollen with righteousness. "The whole
thing was an outrage. By no means did I authorize you to give a
hundred dollars to those people."</p>

<p>Little Gausse stood beside the car, his eyes blazing
suddenly.</p>

<p>"You won't pay me?"</p>

<p>"Of course she will," said Dick.</p>

<p>Suddenly the abuse that Gausse had once endured as a bus boy
in London flamed up and he walked through the moonlight up to
Lady Caroline.</p>

<p>He whipped a string of condemnatory words about her, and as
she turned away with a frozen laugh, he took a step after her and
swiftly planted his little foot in the most celebrated of
targets. Lady Caroline, taken by surprise, flung up her hands
like a person shot as her sailor-clad form sprawled forward on
the sidewalk.</p>

<p>Dick's voice cut across her raging: "Mary, you quiet her down!
or you'll both be in leg-irons in ten minutes!"</p>

<p>On the way back to the hotel old Gausse said not a word, until
they passed the Juan-les-Pins Casino, still sobbing and coughing
with jazz; then he sighed forth:</p>

<p>"I have never seen women like this sort of women. I have known
many of the great courtesans of the world, and for them I have
much respect often, but women like these women I have never seen
before."</p>
