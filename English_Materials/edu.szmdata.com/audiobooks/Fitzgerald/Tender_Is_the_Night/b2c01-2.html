<p class="storyTitle">I</p>





<p>In the spring of 1917, when Doctor Richard Diver first arrived
in Zurich, he was twenty-six years old, a fine age for a man,
indeed the very acme of bachelorhood. Even in war-time days, it
was a fine age for Dick, who was already too valuable, too much
of a capital investment to be shot off in a gun. Years later it
seemed to him that even in this sanctuary he did not escape
lightly, but about that he never fully made up his mind&#151;in 1917
he laughed at the idea, saying apologetically that the war didn't
touch him at all. Instructions from his local board were that he
was to complete his studies in Zurich and take a degree as he had
planned.</p>

<p>Switzerland was an island, washed on one side by the waves of
thunder around Gorizia and on another by the cataracts along the
Somme and the Aisne. For once there seemed more intriguing
strangers than sick ones in the cantons, but that had to be
guessed at&#151;the men who whispered in the little cafés of
Berne and Geneva were as likely to be diamond salesmen or
commercial travellers. However, no one had missed the long trains
of blinded or one-legged men, or dying trunks, that crossed each
other between the bright lakes of Constance and Neuchâtel.
In the beer-halls and shop-windows were bright posters presenting
the Swiss defending their frontiers in 1914&#151;with inspiring
ferocity young men and old men glared down from the mountains at
phantom French and Germans; the purpose was to assure the Swiss
heart that it had shared the contagious glory of those days. As
the massacre continued the posters withered away, and no country
was more surprised than its sister republic when the United
States bungled its way into the war.</p>

<p>Doctor Diver had seen around the edges of the war by that
time: he was an Oxford Rhodes Scholar from Connecticut in 1914.
He returned home for a final year at Johns Hopkins, and took his
degree. In 1916 he managed to get to Vienna under the impression
that, if he did not make haste, the great Freud would eventually
succumb to an aeroplane bomb. Even then Vienna was old with death
but Dick managed to get enough coal and oil to sit in his room in
the Damenstiff Strasse and write the pamphlets that he later
destroyed, but that, rewritten, were the backbone of the book he
published in Zurich in 1920.</p>

<p>Most of us have a favorite, a heroic period, in our lives and
that was Dick Diver's. For one thing he had no idea that he was
charming, that the affection he gave and inspired was anything
unusual among healthy people. In his last year at New Haven some
one referred to him as "lucky Dick"&#151;the name lingered in his
head.</p>

<p>"Lucky Dick, you big stiff," he would whisper to himself,
walking around the last sticks of flame in his room. "You hit it,
my boy. Nobody knew it was there before you came along."</p>

<p>At the beginning of 1917, when it was becoming difficult to
find coal, Dick burned for fuel almost a hundred textbooks that
he had accumulated; but only, as he laid each one on the fire,
with an assurance chuckling inside him that he was himself a
digest of what was within the book, that he could brief it five
years from now, if it deserved to be briefed. This went on at any
odd hour, if necessary, with a floor rug over his shoulders, with
the fine quiet of the scholar which is nearest of all things to
heavenly peace&#151;but which, as will presently be told, had to
end.</p>

<p>For its temporary continuance he thanked his body that had
done the flying rings at New Haven, and now swam in the winter
Danube. With Elkins, second secretary at the Embassy, he shared
an apartment, and there were two nice girl visitors&#151;which was
that and not too much of it, nor too much of the Embassy either.
His contact with Ed Elkins aroused in him a first faint doubt as
to the quality of his mental processes; he could not feel that
they were profoundly different from the thinking of
Elkins&#151;Elkins, who would name you all the quarterbacks in New
Haven for thirty years.</p>

<p>"&#151;And Lucky Dick can't be one of these clever men; he must be
less intact, even faintly destroyed. If life won't do it for him
it's not a substitute to get a disease, or a broken heart, or an
inferiority complex, though it'd be nice to build out some broken
side till it was better than the original structure."</p>

<p>He mocked at his reasoning, calling it specious and
"American"&#151;his criteria of uncerebral phrase-making was that it
was American. He knew, though, that the price of his intactness
was incompleteness.</p>

<p>"The best I can wish you, my child," so said the Fairy
Blackstick in Thackeray's The Rose and the Ring, "is a little
misfortune."</p>

<p>In some moods he griped at his own reasoning: Could I help it
that Pete Livingstone sat in the locker-room Tap Day when
everybody looked all over hell for him? And I got an election
when otherwise I wouldn't have got Elihu, knowing so few men. He
was good and right and I ought to have sat in the locker-room
instead. Maybe I would, if I'd thought I had a chance at an
election. But Mercer kept coming to my room all those weeks. I
guess I knew I had a chance all right, all right. But it would
have served me right if I'd swallowed my pin in the shower and
set up a conflict.</p>

<p>After the lectures at the university he used to argue this
point with a young Rumanian intellectual who reassured him:
"There's no evidence that Goethe ever had a 'conflict' in the
modern sense, or a man like Jung, for instance. You're not a
romantic philosopher&#151;you're a scientist. Memory, force,
character&#151;especially good sense. That's going to be your
trouble&#151;judgment about yourself&#151;once I knew a man who worked
two years on the brain of an armadillo, with the idea that he
would sooner or later know more about the brain of an armadillo
than any one. I kept arguing with him that he was not really
pushing out the extension of the human range&#151;it was too
arbitrary. And sure enough, when he sent his work to the medical
journal they refused it&#151;they had just accepted a thesis by
another man on the same subject."</p>

<p>Dick got up to Zurich on less Achilles' heels than would be
required to equip a centipede, but with plenty&#151;the illusions of
eternal strength and health, and of the essential goodness of
people; illusions of a nation, the lies of generations of
frontier mothers who had to croon falsely, that there were no
wolves outside the cabin door. After he took his degree, he
received his orders to join a neurological unit forming in
Bar-sur-Aube.</p>

<p>In France, to his disgust, the work was executive rather than
practical. In compensation he found time to complete the short
textbook and assemble the material for his next venture. He
returned to Zurich in the spring of 1919 discharged.</p>

<p>The foregoing has the ring of a biography, without the
satisfaction of knowing that the hero, like Grant, lolling in his
general store in Galena, is ready to be called to an intricate
destiny. Moreover it is confusing to come across a youthful
photograph of some one known in a rounded maturity and gaze with
a shock upon a fiery, wiry, eagle-eyed stranger. Best to be
reassuring&#151;Dick Diver's moment now began.</p>
