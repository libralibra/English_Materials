		<p class="storyTitle">I</p>

<p>On the pleasant shore of the French Riviera, about half way
between Marseilles and the Italian border, stands a large, proud,
rose-colored hotel. Deferential palms cool its flushed
façade, and before it stretches a short dazzling beach.
Lately it has become a summer resort of notable and fashionable
people; a decade ago it was almost deserted after its English
clientele went north in April. Now, many bungalows cluster near
it, but when this story begins only the cupolas of a dozen old
villas rotted like water lilies among the massed pines between
Gausse's Hôtel des Étrangers and Cannes, five miles
away.</p>

<p>The hotel and its bright tan prayer rug of a beach were one.
In the early morning the distant image of Cannes, the pink and
cream of old fortifications, the purple Alp that bounded Italy,
were cast across the water and lay quavering in the ripples and
rings sent up by sea-plants through the clear shallows. Before
eight a man came down to the beach in a blue bathrobe and with
much preliminary application to his person of the chilly water,
and much grunting and loud breathing, floundered a minute in the
sea. When he had gone, beach and bay were quiet for an hour.
Merchantmen crawled westward on the horizon; bus boys shouted in
the hotel court; the dew dried upon the pines. In another hour
the horns of motors began to blow down from the winding road
along the low range of the Maures, which separates the littoral
from true Provençal France.</p>

<p>A mile from the sea, where pines give way to dusty poplars, is
an isolated railroad stop, whence one June morning in 1925 a
victoria brought a woman and her daughter down to Gausse's Hotel.
The mother's face was of a fading prettiness that would soon be
patted with broken veins; her expression was both tranquil and
aware in a pleasant way. However, one's eye moved on quickly to
her daughter, who had magic in her pink palms and her cheeks lit
to a lovely flame, like the thrilling flush of children after
their cold baths in the evening. Her fine forehead sloped gently
up to where her hair, bordering it like an armorial shield, burst
into lovelocks and waves and curlicues of ash blonde and gold.
Her eyes were bright, big, clear, wet, and shining, the color of
her cheeks was real, breaking close to the surface from the
strong young pump of her heart. Her body hovered delicately on
the last edge of childhood&#151;she was almost eighteen, nearly
complete, but the dew was still on her.</p>

<p>As sea and sky appeared below them in a thin, hot line the
mother said:</p>

<p>"Something tells me we're not going to like this place."</p>

<p>"I want to go home anyhow," the girl answered.</p>

<p>They both spoke cheerfully but were obviously without
direction and bored by the fact&#151;moreover, just any direction
would not do. They wanted high excitement, not from the necessity
of stimulating jaded nerves but with the avidity of prize-winning
schoolchildren who deserved their vacations.</p>

<p>"We'll stay three days and then go home. I'll wire right away
for steamer tickets."</p>

<p>At the hotel the girl made the reservation in idiomatic but
rather flat French, like something remembered. When they were
installed on the ground floor she walked into the glare of the
French windows and out a few steps onto the stone veranda that
ran the length of the hotel. When she walked she carried herself
like a ballet-dancer, not slumped down on her hips but held up in
the small of her back. Out there the hot light clipped close her
shadow and she retreated&#151;it was too bright to see. Fifty yards
away the Mediterranean yielded up its pigments, moment by moment,
to the brutal sunshine; below the balustrade a faded Buick cooked
on the hotel drive.</p>

<p>Indeed, of all the region only the beach stirred with
activity. Three British nannies sat knitting the slow pattern of
Victorian England, the pattern of the forties, the sixties, and
the eighties, into sweaters and socks, to the tune of gossip as
formalized as incantation; closer to the sea a dozen persons kept
house under striped umbrellas, while their dozen children pursued
unintimidated fish through the shallows or lay naked and
glistening with cocoanut oil out in the sun.</p>

<p>As Rosemary came onto the beach a boy of twelve ran past her
and dashed into the sea with exultant cries. Feeling the
impactive scrutiny of strange faces, she took off her bathrobe
and followed. She floated face down for a few yards and finding
it shallow staggered to her feet and plodded forward, dragging
slim legs like weights against the resistance of the water. When
it was about breast high, she glanced back toward shore: a bald
man in a monocle and a pair of tights, his tufted chest thrown
out, his brash navel sucked in, was regarding her attentively. As
Rosemary returned the gaze the man dislodged the monocle, which
went into hiding amid the facetious whiskers of his chest, and
poured himself a glass of something from a bottle in his
hand.</p>

<p>Rosemary laid her face on the water and swam a choppy little
four-beat crawl out to the raft. The water reached up for her,
pulled her down tenderly out of the heat, seeped in her hair and
ran into the corners of her body. She turned round and round in
it, embracing it, wallowing in it. Reaching the raft she was out
of breath, but a tanned woman with very white teeth looked down
at her, and Rosemary, suddenly conscious of the raw whiteness of
her own body, turned on her back and drifted toward shore. The
hairy man holding the bottle spoke to her as she came out.</p>

<p>"I say&#151;they have sharks out behind the raft." He was of
indeterminate nationality, but spoke English with a slow Oxford
drawl. "Yesterday they devoured two British sailors from the
flotte at Golfe Juan."</p>

<p>"Heavens!" exclaimed Rosemary.</p>

<p>"They come in for the refuse from the flotte."</p>

<p>Glazing his eyes to indicate that he had only spoken in order
to warn her, he minced off two steps and poured himself another
drink.</p>

<p>Not unpleasantly self-conscious, since there had been a slight
sway of attention toward her during this conversation, Rosemary
looked for a place to sit. Obviously each family possessed the
strip of sand immediately in front of its umbrella; besides there
was much visiting and talking back and forth&#151;the atmosphere of a
community upon which it would be presumptuous to intrude. Farther
up, where the beach was strewn with pebbles and dead sea-weed,
sat a group with flesh as white as her own. They lay under small
hand-parasols instead of beach umbrellas and were obviously less
indigenous to the place. Between the dark people and the light,
Rosemary found room and spread out her peignoir on the sand.</p>

<p>Lying so, she first heard their voices and felt their feet
skirt her body and their shapes pass between the sun and herself.
The breath of an inquisitive dog blew warm and nervous on her
neck; she could feel her skin broiling a little in the heat and
hear the small exhausted wa-<i>waa</i> of the expiring waves.
Presently her ear distinguished individual voices and she became
aware that some one referred to scornfully as "that North guy"
had kidnapped a waiter from a café in Cannes last night in
order to saw him in two. The sponsor of the story was a
white-haired woman in full evening dress, obviously a relic of
the previous evening, for a tiara still clung to her head and a
discouraged orchid expired from her shoulder. Rosemary, forming a
vague antipathy to her and her companions, turned away.</p>

<p>Nearest her, on the other side, a young woman lay under a roof
of umbrellas making out a list of things from a book open on the
sand. Her bathing suit was pulled off her shoulders and her back,
a ruddy, orange brown, set off by a string of creamy pearls,
shone in the sun. Her face was hard and lovely and pitiful. Her
eyes met Rosemary's but did not see her. Beyond her was a fine
man in a jockey cap and red-striped tights; then the woman
Rosemary had seen on the raft, and who looked back at her, seeing
her; then a man with a long face and a golden, leonine head, with
blue tights and no hat, talking very seriously to an unmistakably
Latin young man in black tights, both of them picking at little
pieces of seaweed in the sand. She thought they were mostly
Americans, but something made them unlike the Americans she had
known of late.</p>

<p>After a while she realized that the man in the jockey cap was
giving a quiet little performance for this group; he moved
gravely about with a rake, ostensibly removing gravel and
meanwhile developing some esoteric burlesque held in suspension
by his grave face. Its faintest ramification had become
hilarious, until whatever he said released a burst of laughter.
Even those who, like herself, were too far away to hear, sent out
antennæ of attention until the only person on the beach not
caught up in it was the young woman with the string of pearls.
Perhaps from modesty of possession she responded to each salvo of
amusement by bending closer over her list.</p>

<p>The man of the monocle and bottle spoke suddenly out of the
sky above Rosemary.</p>

<p>"You are a ripping swimmer."</p>

<p>She demurred.</p>

<p>"Jolly good. My name is Campion. Here is a lady who says she
saw you in Sorrento last week and knows who you are and would so
like to meet you."</p>

<p>Glancing around with concealed annoyance Rosemary saw the
untanned people were waiting. Reluctantly she got up and went
over to them.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Abrams&#151;Mrs. McKisco&#151;Mr. McKisco&#151;Mr. Dumphry&#151;</p>

<p>"We know who you are," spoke up the woman in evening dress.
"You're Rosemary Hoyt and I recognized you in Sorrento and asked
the hotel clerk and we all think you're perfectly marvellous and
we want to know why you're not back in America making another
marvellous moving picture."</p>

<p>They made a superfluous gesture of moving over for her. The
woman who had recognized her was not a Jewess, despite her name.
She was one of those elderly "good sports" preserved by an
imperviousness to experience and a good digestion into another
generation.</p>

<p>"We wanted to warn you about getting burned the first day,"
she continued cheerily, "because <i>your</i> skin is important,
but there seems to be so darn much formality on this beach that
we didn't know whether you'd mind."</p>
