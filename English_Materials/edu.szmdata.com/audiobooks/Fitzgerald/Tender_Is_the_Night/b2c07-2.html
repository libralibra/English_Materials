<p>It was late afternoon when they wound up the discussion as to
what Dick should do, he must be most kind and yet eliminate
himself. When the doctors stood up at last, Dick's eyes fell
outside the window to where a light rain was falling&#151;Nicole was
waiting, expectant, somewhere in that rain. When, presently, he
went out buttoning his oil-skin at the throat, pulling down the
brim of his hat, he came upon her immediately under the roof of
the main entrance.</p>

<p>"I know a new place we can go," she said. "When I was ill I
didn't mind sitting inside with the others in the evening&#151;what
they said seemed like everything else. Naturally now I see them
as ill and it's&#151;it's&#151;"</p>

<p>"You'll be leaving soon."</p>

<p>"Oh, soon. My sister, Beth, but she's always been called Baby,
she's coming in a few weeks to take me somewhere; after that I'll
be back here for a last month."</p>

<p>"The older sister?"</p>

<p>"Oh, quite a bit older. She's twenty-four&#151;she's very English.
She lives in London with my father's sister. She was engaged to
an Englishman but he was killed&#151;I never saw him."</p>

<p>Her face, ivory gold against the blurred sunset that strove
through the rain, had a promise Dick had never seen before: the
high cheek-bones, the faintly wan quality, cool rather than
feverish, was reminiscent of the frame of a promising colt&#151;a
creature whose life did not promise to be only a projection of
youth upon a grayer screen, but instead, a true growing; the face
would be handsome in middle life; it would be handsome in old
age: the essential structure and the economy were there.</p>

<p>"What are you looking at?"</p>

<p>"I was just thinking that you're going to be rather
happy."</p>

<p>Nicole was frightened: "Am I? All right&#151;things couldn't be
worse than they have been."</p>

<p>In the covered woodshed to which she had led him, she sat
cross-legged upon her golf shoes, her burberry wound about her
and her cheeks stung alive by the damp air. Gravely she returned
his gaze, taking in his somewhat proud carriage that never quite
yielded to the wooden post against which he leaned; she looked
into his face that always tried to discipline itself into molds
of attentive seriousness, after excursions into joys and
mockeries of its own. That part of him which seemed to fit his
reddish Irish coloring she knew least; she was afraid of it, yet
more anxious to explore&#151;this was his more masculine side: the
other part, the trained part, the consideration in the polite
eyes, she expropriated without question, as most women did.</p>

<p>"At least this institution has been good for languages," said
Nicole. "I've spoken French with two doctors, and German with the
nurses, and Italian, or something like it, with a couple of
scrub-women and one of the patients, and I've picked up a lot of
Spanish from another."</p>

<p>"That's fine."</p>

<p>He tried to arrange an attitude but no logic seemed
forthcoming.</p>

<p>"&#151;Music too. Hope you didn't think I was only interested in
ragtime. I practise every day&#151;the last few months I've been
taking a course in Zurich on the history of music. In fact it was
all that kept me going at times&#151;music and the drawing." She
leaned suddenly and twisted a loose strip from the sole of her
shoe and then looked up. "I'd like to draw you just the way you
are now."</p>

<p>It made him sad when she brought out her accomplishments for
his approval.</p>

<p>"I envy you. At present I don't seem to be interested in
anything except my work."</p>

<p>"Oh, I think that's fine for a man," she said quickly. "But
for a girl I think she ought to have lots of minor
accomplishments and pass them on to her children."</p>

<p>"I suppose so," said Dick with deliberated indifference.</p>

<p>Nicole sat quiet. Dick wished she would speak so that he could
play the easy rôle of wet blanket, but now she sat
quiet.</p>

<p>"You're all well," he said. "Try to forget the past; don't
overdo things for a year or so. Go back to America and be a
débutante and fall in love&#151;and be happy."</p>

<p>"I couldn't fall in love." Her injured shoe scraped a cocoon
of dust from the log on which she sat.</p>

<p>"Sure you can," Dick insisted. "Not for a year maybe, but
sooner or later." Then he added brutally: "You can have a
perfectly normal life with a houseful of beautiful descendants.
The very fact that you could make a complete comeback at your age
proves that the precipitating factors were pretty near
everything. Young woman, you'll be pulling your weight long after
your friends are carried off screaming."</p>

<p>&#151;But there was a look of pain in her eyes as she took the
rough dose, the harsh reminder.</p>

<p>"I know I wouldn't be fit to marry any one for a long time,"
she said humbly.</p>

<p>Dick was too upset to say any more. He looked out into the
grain field trying to recover his hard brassy attitude.</p>

<p>"You'll be all right&#151;everybody here believes in you. Why,
Doctor Gregory is so proud of you that he'll probably&#151;"</p>

<p>"I hate Doctor Gregory."</p>

<p>"Well, you shouldn't."</p>

<p>Nicole's world had fallen to pieces, but it was only a flimsy
and scarcely created world; beneath it her emotions and instincts
fought on. Was it an hour ago she had waited by the entrance,
wearing her hope like a corsage at her belt?</p>

<p>. . . Dress stay crisp for him, button stay put, bloom
narcissus&#151;air stay still and sweet.</p>

<p>"It will be nice to have fun again," she fumbled on. For a
moment she entertained a desperate idea of telling him how rich
she was, what big houses she lived in, that really she was a
valuable property&#151;for a moment she made herself into her
grandfather, Sid Warren, the horse-trader. But she survived the
temptation to confuse all values and shut these matters into
their Victorian side-chambers&#151;even though there was no home left
to her, save emptiness and pain.</p>

<p>"I have to go back to the clinic. It's not raining now."</p>

<p>Dick walked beside her, feeling her unhappiness, and wanting
to drink the rain that touched her cheek.</p>

<p>"I have some new records," she said. "I can hardly wait to
play them. Do you know&#151;"</p>





<p>After supper that evening, Dick thought, he would finish the
break; also he wanted to kick Franz's bottom for having partially
introduced him to such a sordid business. He waited in the hall.
His eyes followed a beret, not wet with waiting like Nicole's
beret, but covering a skull recently operated on. Beneath it
human eyes peered, found him and came over:</p>

<p>"Bonjour, Docteur."</p>

<p>"Bonjour, Monsieur."</p>

<p>"Il fait beau temps."</p>

<p>"Oui, merveilleux."</p>

<p>"Vous êtes ici maintenant?"</p>

<p>"Non, pour la journée seulement."</p>

<p>"Ah, bon. Alors&#151;au revoir, Monsieur."</p>

<p>Glad at having survived another contact, the wretch in the
beret moved away. Dick waited. Presently a nurse came downstairs
and delivered him a message.</p>

<p>"Miss Warren asks to be excused, Doctor. She wants to lie
down. She wants to have dinner upstairs to-night."</p>

<p>The nurse hung on his response, half expecting him to imply
that Miss Warren's attitude was pathological.</p>

<p>"Oh, I see. Well&#151;" He rearranged the flow of his own saliva,
the pulse of his heart. "I hope she feels better. Thanks."</p>

<p>He was puzzled and discontent. At any rate it freed him.</p>

<p>Leaving a note for Franz begging off from supper, he walked
through the countryside to the tram station. As he reached the
platform, with spring twilight gilding the rails and the glass in
the slot machines, he began to feel that the station, the
hospital, was hovering between being centripetal and centrifugal.
He felt frightened. He was glad when the substantial
cobble-stones of Zurich clicked once more under his shoes.</p>

<p>He expected to hear from Nicole next day but there was no
word. Wondering if she was ill, he called the clinic and talked
to Franz.</p>

<p>"She came downstairs to luncheon yesterday and to-day," said
Franz. "She seemed a little abstracted and in the clouds. How did
it go off?"</p>

<p>Dick tried to plunge over the Alpine crevasse between the
sexes.</p>

<p>"We didn't get to it&#151;at least I didn't think we did. I tried
to be distant, but I didn't think enough happened to change her
attitude if it ever went deep."</p>

<p>Perhaps his vanity had been hurt that there was no coup de
grâce to administer.</p>

<p>"From some things she said to her nurse I'm inclined to think
she understood."</p>

<p>"All right."</p>

<p>"It was the best thing that could have happened. She doesn't
seem over-agitated&#151;only a little in the clouds."</p>

<p>"All right, then."</p>

<p>"Dick, come soon and see me."</p>
