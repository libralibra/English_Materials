<p>When Dick got out of the elevator he followed a tortuous
corridor and turned at length toward a distant voice outside a
lighted door. Rosemary was in black pajamas; a luncheon table was
still in the room; she was having coffee.</p>

<p>"You're still beautiful," he said. "A little more beautiful
than ever."</p>

<p>"Do you want coffee, youngster?"</p>

<p>"I'm sorry I was so unpresentable this morning."</p>

<p>"You didn't look well&#151;you all right now? Want coffee?"</p>

<p>"No, thanks."</p>

<p>"You're fine again, I was scared this morning. Mother's coming
over next month, if the company stays. She always asks me if I've
seen you over here, as if she thought we were living next door.
Mother always liked you&#151;she always felt you were some one I
ought to know."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm glad she still thinks of me."</p>

<p>"Oh, she does," Rosemary reassured him. "A very great
deal."</p>

<p>"I've seen you here and there in pictures," said Dick. "Once I
had <i>Daddy's Girl</i> run off just for myself!"</p>

<p>"I have a good part in this one if it isn't cut."</p>

<p>She crossed behind him, touching his shoulder as she passed.
She phoned for the table to be taken away and settled in a big
chair.</p>

<p>"I was just a little girl when I met you, Dick. Now I'm a
woman."</p>

<p>"I want to hear everything about you."</p>

<p>"How is Nicole&#151;and Lanier and Topsy?"</p>

<p>"They're fine. They often speak of you&#151;"</p>

<p>The phone rang. While she answered it Dick examined two
novels&#151;one by Edna Ferber, one by Albert McKisco. The waiter
came for the table; bereft of its presence Rosemary seemed more
alone in her black pajamas.</p>

<p>". . . I have a caller. . . . No, not very well. I've got to
go to the costumer's for a long fitting. . . . No, not now . .
."</p>

<p>As though with the disappearance of the table she felt
released, Rosemary smiled at Dick&#151;that smile as if they two
together had managed to get rid of all the trouble in the world
and were now at peace in their own heaven . . .</p>

<p>"That's done," she said. "Do you realize I've spent the last
hour getting ready for you?"</p>

<p>But again the phone called her. Dick got up to change his hat
from the bed to the luggage stand, and in alarm Rosemary put her
hand over the mouthpiece of the phone. "You're not going!"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>When the communication was over he tried to drag the afternoon
together saying: "I expect some nourishment from people now."</p>

<p>"Me too," Rosemary agreed. "The man that just phoned me once
knew a second cousin of mine. Imagine calling anybody up for a
reason like that!"</p>

<p>Now she lowered the lights for love. Why else should she want
to shut off his view of her? He sent his words to her like
letters, as though they left him some time before they reached
her.</p>

<p>"Hard to sit here and be close to you, and not kiss you." Then
they kissed passionately in the centre of the floor. She pressed
against him, and went back to her chair.</p>

<p>It could not go on being merely pleasant in the room. Forward
or backward; when the phone rang once more he strolled into the
bedchamber and lay down on her bed, opening Albert McKisco's
novel. Presently Rosemary came in and sat beside him.</p>

<p>"You have the longest eyelashes," she remarked.</p>

<p>"We are now back at the Junior Prom. Among those present are
Miss Rosemary Hoyt, the eyelash fancier&#151;"</p>

<p>She kissed him and he pulled her down so that they lay side by
side, and then they kissed till they were both breathless. Her
breathing was young and eager and exciting. Her lips were faintly
chapped but soft in the corners.</p>

<p>When they were still limbs and feet and clothes, struggles of
his arms and back, and her throat and breasts, she whispered,
"No, not now&#151;those things are rhythmic."</p>

<p>Disciplined he crushed his passion into a corner of his mind,
but bearing up her fragility on his arms until she was poised
half a foot above him, he said lightly:</p>

<p>"Darling&#151;that doesn't matter."</p>

<p>Her face had changed with his looking up at it; there was the
eternal moonlight in it.</p>

<p>"That would be poetic justice if it should be you," she said.
She twisted away from him, walked to the mirror, and boxed her
disarranged hair with her hands. Presently she drew a chair close
to the bed and stroked his cheek.</p>

<p>"Tell me the truth about you," he demanded.</p>

<p>"I always have."</p>

<p>"In a way&#151;but nothing hangs together."</p>

<p>They both laughed but he pursued.</p>

<p>"Are you actually a virgin?"</p>

<p>"No-o-o!" she sang. "I've slept with six hundred and forty
men&#151;if that's the answer you want."</p>

<p>"It's none of my business."</p>

<p>"Do you want me for a case in psychology?"</p>

<p>"Looking at you as a perfectly normal girl of twenty-two,
living in the year nineteen twenty-eight, I guess you've taken a
few shots at love."</p>

<p>"It's all been&#151;abortive," she said.</p>

<p>Dick couldn't believe her. He could not decide whether she was
deliberately building a barrier between them or whether this was
intended to make an eventual surrender more significant.</p>

<p>"Let's go walk in the Pincio," he suggested.</p>

<p>He shook himself straight in his clothes and smoothed his
hair. A moment had come and somehow passed. For three years Dick
had been the ideal by which Rosemary measured other men and
inevitably his stature had increased to heroic size. She did not
want him to be like other men, yet here were the same exigent
demands, as if he wanted to take some of herself away, carry it
off in his pocket.</p>

<p>Walking on the greensward between cherubs and philosophers,
fauns and falling water, she took his arm snugly, settling into
it with a series of little readjustments, as if she wanted it to
be right because it was going to be there forever. She plucked a
twig and broke it, but she found no spring in it. Suddenly seeing
what she wanted in Dick's face she took his gloved hand and
kissed it. Then she cavorted childishly for him until he smiled
and she laughed and they began having a good time.</p>

<p>"I can't go out with you to-night, darling, because I promised
some people a long time ago. But if you'll get up early I'll take
you out to the set to-morrow."</p>

<p>He dined alone at the hotel, went to bed early, and met
Rosemary in the lobby at half-past six. Beside him in the car she
glowed away fresh and new in the morning sunshine. They went out
through the Porta San Sebastiano and along the Appian Way until
they came to the huge set of the forum, larger than the forum
itself. Rosemary turned him over to a man who led him about the
great props; the arches and tiers of seats and the sanded arena.
She was working on a stage which represented a guard-room for
Christian prisoners, and presently they went there and watched
Nicotera, one of many hopeful Valentinos, strut and pose before a
dozen female "captives," their eyes melancholy and startling with
mascara.</p>

<p>Rosemary appeared in a knee-length tunic.</p>

<p>"Watch this," she whispered to Dick. "I want your opinion.
Everybody that's seen the rushes says&#151;"</p>

<p>"What are the rushes?"</p>

<p>"When they run off what they took the day before. They say
it's the first thing I've had sex appeal in."</p>

<p>"I don't notice it."</p>

<p>"You wouldn't! But I have."</p>

<p>Nicotera in his leopard skin talked attentively to Rosemary
while the electrician discussed something with the director,
meanwhile leaning on him. Finally the director pushed his hand
off roughly and wiped a sweating forehead, and Dick's guide
remarked: "He's on the hop again, and how!"</p>

<p>"Who?" asked Dick, but before the man could answer the
director walked swiftly over to them.</p>

<p>"Who's on the hop&#151;you're on the hop yourself." He spoke
vehemently to Dick, as if to a jury. "When he's on the hop he
always thinks everybody else is, and how!" He glared at the guide
a moment longer, then he clapped his hands: "All right&#151;everybody
on the set."</p>

<p>It was like visiting a great turbulent family. An actress
approached Dick and talked to him for five minutes under the
impression that he was an actor recently arrived from London.
Discovering her mistake she scuttled away in panic. The majority
of the company felt either sharply superior or sharply inferior
to the world outside, but the former feeling prevailed. They were
people of bravery and industry; they were risen to a position of
prominence in a nation that for a decade had wanted only to be
entertained.</p>

<p>The session ended as the light grew misty&#151;a fine light for
painters, but, for the camera, not to be compared with the clear
California air. Nicotera followed Rosemary to the car and
whispered something to her&#151;she looked at him without smiling as
she said good-by.</p>

<p>Dick and Rosemary had luncheon at the Castelli dei
CÃ¦sari, a splendid restaurant in a high-terraced villa
overlooking the ruined forum of an undetermined period of the
decadence. Rosemary took a cocktail and a little wine, and Dick
took enough so that his feeling of dissatisfaction left him.
Afterward they drove back to the hotel, all flushed and happy, in
a sort of exalted quiet. She wanted to be taken and she was, and
what had begun with a childish infatuation on a beach was
accomplished at last.</p>
