<p class="storyTitle">XIX</p>





<p>Abe left from the Gare Saint Lazare at eleven&#151;he stood alone
under the fouled glass dome, relic of the seventies, era of the
Crystal Palace; his hands, of that vague gray color that only
twenty-four hours can produce, were in his coat pockets to
conceal the trembling fingers. With his hat removed it was plain
that only the top layer of his hair was brushed back&#151;the lower
levels were pointed resolutely sidewise. He was scarcely
recognizable as the man who had swum upon Gausse's Beach a
fortnight ago.</p>

<p>He was early; he looked from left to right with his eyes only;
it would have taken nervous forces out of his control to use any
other part of his body. New-looking baggage went past him;
presently prospective passengers, with dark little bodies, were
calling: "Jew-uls-<i>Hoo-oo!</i>" in dark piercing voices.</p>

<p>At the minute when he wondered whether or not he had time for
a drink at the buffet, and began clutching at the soggy wad of
thousand-franc notes in his pocket, one end of his pendulous
glance came to rest upon the apparition of Nicole at the
stairhead. He watched her&#151;she was self-revelatory in her little
expressions as people seem to some one waiting for them, who as
yet is himself unobserved. She was frowning, thinking of her
children, less gloating over them than merely animally counting
them&#151;a cat checking her cubs with a paw.</p>

<p>When she saw Abe, the mood passed out of her face; the glow of
the morning skylight was sad, and Abe made a gloomy figure with
dark circles that showed through the crimson tan under his eyes.
They sat down on a bench.</p>

<p>"I came because you asked me," said Nicole defensively. Abe
seemed to have forgotten why he asked her and Nicole was quite
content to look at the travellers passing by.</p>

<p>"That's going to be the belle of your boat&#151;that one with all
the men to say good-by&#151;you see why she bought that dress?"
Nicole talked faster and faster. "You see why nobody else would
buy it except the belle of the world cruise? See? No? Wake up!
That's a story dress&#151;that extra material tells a story and
somebody on world cruise would be lonesome enough to want to hear
it."</p>

<p>She bit close her last words; she had talked too much for her;
and Abe found it difficult to gather from her serious set face
that she had spoken at all. With an effort he drew himself up to
a posture that looked as if he were standing up while he was
sitting down.</p>

<p>"The afternoon you took me to that funny ball&#151;you know, St.
Genevieve's&#151;" he began.</p>

<p>"I remember. It was fun, wasn't it?"</p>

<p>"No fun for me. I haven't had fun seeing you this time. I'm
tired of you both, but it doesn't show because you're even more
tired of me&#151;you know what I mean. If I had any enthusiasm, I'd
go on to new people."</p>

<p>There was a rough nap on Nicole's velvet gloves as she slapped
him back:</p>

<p>"Seems rather foolish to be unpleasant, Abe. Anyhow you don't
mean that. I can't see why you've given up about everything."</p>

<p>Abe considered, trying hard not to cough or blow his nose.</p>

<p>"I suppose I got bored; and then it was such a long way to go
back in order to get anywhere."</p>

<p>Often a man can play the helpless child in front of a woman,
but he can almost never bring it off when he feels most like a
helpless child.</p>

<p>"No excuse for it," Nicole said crisply.</p>

<p>Abe was feeling worse every minute&#151;he could think of nothing
but disagreeable and sheerly nervous remarks. Nicole thought that
the correct attitude for her was to sit staring straight ahead,
hands in her lap. For a while there was no communication between
them&#151;each was racing away from the other, breathing only insofar
as there was blue space ahead, a sky not seen by the other.
Unlike lovers they possessed no past; unlike man and wife, they
possessed no future; yet up to this morning Nicole had liked Abe
better than any one except Dick&#151;and he had been heavy,
belly-frightened, with love for her for years.</p>

<p>"Tired of women's worlds," he spoke up suddenly.</p>

<p>"Then why don't you make a world of your own?"</p>

<p>"Tired of friends. The thing is to have sycophants."</p>

<p>Nicole tried to force the minute hand around on the station
clock, but, "You agree?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"I am a woman and my business is to hold things together."</p>

<p>"My business is to tear them apart."</p>

<p>"When you get drunk you don't tear anything apart except
yourself," she said, cold now, and frightened and unconfident.
The station was filling but no one she knew came. After a moment
her eyes fell gratefully on a tall girl with straw hair like a
helmet, who was dropping letters in the mail slot.</p>

<p>"A girl I have to speak to, Abe. Abe, wake up! You fool!"</p>

<p>Patiently Abe followed her with his eyes. The woman turned in
a startled way to greet Nicole, and Abe recognized her as some
one he had seen around Paris. He took advantage of Nicole's
absence to cough hard and retchingly into his handkerchief, and
to blow his nose loud. The morning was warmer and his underwear
was soaked with sweat. His fingers trembled so violently that it
took four matches to light a cigarette; it seemed absolutely
necessary to make his way into the buffet for a drink, but
immediately Nicole returned.</p>

<p>"That was a mistake," she said with frosty humor. "After
begging me to come and see her, she gave me a good snubbing. She
looked at me as if I were rotted." Excited, she did a little
laugh, as with two fingers high in the scales. "Let people come
to you."</p>

<p>Abe recovered from a cigarette cough and remarked:</p>

<p>"Trouble is when you're sober you don't want to see anybody,
and when you're tight nobody wants to see you."</p>

<p>"Who, me?" Nicole laughed again; for some reason the late
encounter had cheered her.</p>

<p>"No&#151;me."</p>

<p>"Speak for yourself. I like people, a lot of people&#151;I
like&#151;"</p>

<p>Rosemary and Mary North came in sight, walking slowly and
searching for Abe, and Nicole burst forth grossly with "Hey! Hi!
Hey!" and laughed and waved the package of handkerchiefs she had
bought for Abe.</p>

<p>They stood in an uncomfortable little group weighted down by
Abe's gigantic presence: he lay athwart them like the wreck of a
galleon, dominating with his presence his own weakness and
self-indulgence, his narrowness and bitterness. All of them were
conscious of the solemn dignity that flowed from him, of his
achievement, fragmentary, suggestive and surpassed. But they were
frightened at his survivant will, once a will to live, now become
a will to die.</p>

<p>Dick Diver came and brought with him a fine glowing surface on
which the three women sprang like monkeys with cries of relief,
perching on his shoulders, on the beautiful crown of his hat or
the gold head of his cane. Now, for a moment, they could
disregard the spectacle of Abe's gigantic obscenity. Dick saw the
situation quickly and grasped it quietly. He pulled them out of
themselves into the station, making plain its wonders. Nearby,
some Americans were saying good-by in voices that mimicked the
cadence of water running into a large old bathtub. Standing in
the station, with Paris in back of them, it seemed as if they
were vicariously leaning a little over the ocean, already
undergoing a sea-change, a shifting about of atoms to form the
essential molecule of a new people.</p>

<p>So the well-to-do Americans poured through the station onto
the platforms with frank new faces, intelligent, considerate,
thoughtless, thought-for. An occasional English face among them
seemed sharp and emergent. When there were enough Americans on
the platform the first impression of their immaculacy and their
money began to fade into a vague racial dusk that hindered and
blinded both them and their observers.</p>

<p>Nicole seized Dick's arm crying, "Look!" Dick turned in time
to see what took place in half a minute. At a Pullman entrance
two cars off, a vivid scene detached itself from the tenor of
many farewells. The young woman with the helmet-like hair to whom
Nicole had spoken made an odd dodging little run away from the
man to whom she was talking and plunged a frantic hand into her
purse; then the sound of two revolver shots cracked the narrow
air of the platform. Simultaneously the engine whistled sharply
and the train began to move, momentarily dwarfing the shots in
significance. Abe waved again from his window, oblivious to what
had happened. But before the crowd closed in, the others had seen
the shots take effect, seen the target sit down upon the
platform.</p>

<p>Only after a hundred years did the train stop; Nicole, Mary,
and Rosemary waited on the outskirts while Dick fought his way
through. It was five minutes before he found them again&#151;by this
time the crowd had split into two sections, following,
respectively, the man on a stretcher and the girl walking pale
and firm between distraught gendarmes.</p>

<p>"It was Maria Wallis," Dick said hurriedly. "The man she shot
was an Englishman&#151;they had an awful time finding out who,
because she shot him through his identification card." They were
walking quickly from the train, swayed along with the crowd. "I
found out what poste de police they're taking her to so I'll go
there&#151;"</p>

<p>"But her sister lives in Paris," Nicole objected. "Why not
phone her? Seems very peculiar nobody thought of that. She's
married to a Frenchman, and he can do more than we can."</p>

<p>Dick hesitated, shook his head and started off.</p>

<p>"Wait!" Nicole cried after him. "That's foolish&#151;how can you
do any good&#151;with your French?"</p>

<p>"At least I'll see they don't do anything outrageous to
her."</p>

<p>"They're certainly going to hold on to her," Nicole assured
him briskly. "She <i>did</i> shoot the man. The best thing is to
phone right away to Laura&#151;she can do more than we can."</p>

<p>Dick was unconvinced&#151;also he was showing off for
Rosemary.</p>

<p>"You wait," said Nicole firmly, and hurried off to a telephone
booth.</p>

<p>"When Nicole takes things into her hands," he said with
affectionate irony, "there is nothing more to be done."</p>

<p>He saw Rosemary for the first time that morning. They
exchanged glances, trying to recognize the emotions of the day
before. For a moment each seemed unreal to the other&#151;then the
slow warm hum of love began again.</p>

<p>"You like to help everybody, don't you?" Rosemary said.</p>

<p>"I only pretend to."</p>

<p>"Mother likes to help everybody&#151;of course she can't help as
many people as you do." She sighed. "Sometimes I think I'm the
most selfish person in the world."</p>

<p>For the first time the mention of her mother annoyed rather
than amused Dick. He wanted to sweep away her mother, remove the
whole affair from the nursery footing upon which Rosemary
persistently established it. But he realized that this impulse
was a loss of control&#151;what would become of Rosemary's urge
toward him if, for even a moment, he relaxed. He saw, not without
panic, that the affair was sliding to rest; it could not stand
still, it must go on or go back; for the first time it occurred
to him that Rosemary had her hand on the lever more
authoritatively than he.</p>

<p>Before he had thought out a course of procedure, Nicole
returned.</p>

<p>"I found Laura. It was the first news she had and her voice
kept fading away and then getting loud again&#151;as if she was
fainting and then pulling herself together. She said she knew
something was going to happen this morning."</p>

<p>"Maria ought to be with Diaghileff," said Dick in a gentle
tone, in order to bring them back to quietude. "She has a nice
sense of decor&#151;not to say rhythm. Will any of us ever see a
train pulling out without hearing a few shots?"</p>

<p>They bumped down the wide steel steps. "I'm sorry for the poor
man," Nicole said. "Course that's why she talked so strange to
me&#151;she was getting ready to open fire."</p>

<p>She laughed, Rosemary laughed too, but they were both
horrified, and both of them deeply wanted Dick to make a moral
comment on the matter and not leave it to them. This wish was not
entirely conscious, especially on the part of Rosemary, who was
accustomed to having shell fragments of such events shriek past
her head. But a totality of shock had piled up in her too. For
the moment, Dick was too shaken by the impetus of his newly
recognized emotion to resolve things into the pattern of the
holiday, so the women, missing something, lapsed into a vague
unhappiness.</p>

<p>Then, as if nothing had happened, the lives of the Divers and
their friends flowed out into the street.</p>

<p>However, everything had happened&#151;Abe's departure and Mary's
impending departure for Salzburg this afternoon had ended the
time in Paris. Or perhaps the shots, the concussions that had
finished God knew what dark matter, had terminated it. The shots
had entered into all their lives: echoes of violence followed
them out onto the pavement where two porters held a post-mortem
beside them as they waited for a taxi.</p>

<p>"Tu as vu le revolver? Il était très petit,
vraie perle&#151;un jouet."</p>

<p>"Mais, assez puissant!" said the other porter sagely. "Tu as
vu sa chemise? Assez de sang pour se croire à la
guerre."</p>
