<p>The Divers would return to the Riviera, which was home. The
Villa Diana had been rented again for the summer, so they divided
the intervening time between German spas and French cathedral
towns where they were always happy for a few days. Dick wrote a
little with no particular method; it was one of those parts of
life that is an awaiting; not upon Nicole's health, which seemed
to thrive on travel, nor upon work, but simply an awaiting. The
factor that gave purposefulness to the period was the
children.</p>

<p>Dick's interest in them increased with their ages, now eleven
and nine. He managed to reach them over the heads of employees on
the principle that both the forcing of children and the fear of
forcing them were inadequate substitutes for the long, careful
watchfulness, the checking and balancing and reckoning of
accounts, to the end that there should be no slip below a certain
level of duty. He came to know them much better than Nicole did,
and in expansive moods over the wines of several countries he
talked and played with them at length. They had that wistful
charm, almost sadness, peculiar to children who have learned
early not to cry or laugh with abandon; they were apparently
moved to no extremes of emotion, but content with a simple
regimentation and the simple pleasures allowed them. They lived
on the even tenor found advisable in the experience of old
families of the Western world, brought up rather than brought
out. Dick thought, for example, that nothing was more conducive
to the development of observation than compulsory silence.</p>

<p>Lanier was an unpredictable boy with an inhuman curiosity.
"Well, how many Pomeranians would it take to lick a lion,
father?" was typical of the questions with which he harassed
Dick. Topsy was easier. She was nine and very fair and
exquisitely made like Nicole, and in the past Dick had worried
about that. Lately she had become as robust as any American
child. He was satisfied with them both, but conveyed the fact to
them only in a tacit way. They were not let off breaches of good
conduct&#151;"Either one learns politeness at home," Dick said, "or
the world teaches it to you with a whip and you may get hurt in
the process. What do I care whether Topsy 'adores' me or not? I'm
not bringing her up to be my wife."</p>

<p>Another element that distinguished this summer and autumn for
the Divers was a plenitude of money. Due to the sale of their
interest in the clinic, and to developments in America, there was
now so much that the mere spending of it, the care of goods, was
an absorption in itself. The style in which they travelled seemed
fabulous.</p>

<p>Regard them, for example, as the train slows up at Boyen where
they are to spend a fortnight visiting. The shifting from the
wagon-lit has begun at the Italian frontier. The governess's maid
and Madame Diver's maid have come up from second class to help
with the baggage and the dogs. Mlle. Bellois will superintend the
hand-luggage, leaving the Sealyhams to one maid and the pair of
Pekinese to the other. It is not necessarily poverty of spirit
that makes a woman surround herself with life&#151;it can be a
superabundance of interest, and, except during her flashes of
illness, Nicole was capable of being curator of it all. For
example with the great quantity of heavy baggage&#151;presently from
the van would be unloaded four wardrobe trunks, a shoe trunk,
three hat trunks, and two hat boxes, a chest of servants' trunks,
a portable filing-cabinet, a medicine case, a spirit lamp
container, a picnic set, four tennis rackets in presses and
cases, a phonograph, a typewriter. Distributed among the spaces
reserved for family and entourage were two dozen supplementary
grips, satchels and packages, each one numbered, down to the tag
on the cane case. Thus all of it could be checked up in two
minutes on any station platform, some for storage, some for
accompaniment from the "light trip list" or the "heavy trip
list," constantly revised, and carried on metal-edged plaques in
Nicole's purse. She had devised the system as a child when
travelling with her failing mother. It was equivalent to the
system of a regimental supply officer who must think of the
bellies and equipment of three thousand men.</p>

<p>The Divers flocked from the train into the early gathered
twilight of the valley. The village people watched the
debarkation with an awe akin to that which followed the Italian
pilgrimages of Lord Byron a century before. Their hostess was the
Contessa di Minghetti, lately Mary North. The journey that had
begun in a room over the shop of a paperhanger in Newark had
ended in an extraordinary marriage.</p>

<p>"Conte di Minghetti" was merely a papal title&#151;the wealth of
Mary's husband flowed from his being ruler-owner of manganese
deposits in southwestern Asia. He was not quite light enough to
travel in a pullman south of Mason-Dixon; he was of the
Kyble-Berber-Sabaean-Hindu strain that belts across north Africa
and Asia, more sympathetic to the European than the mongrel faces
of the ports.</p>

<p>When these princely households, one of the East, one of the
West, faced each other on the station platform, the splendor of
the Divers seemed pioneer simplicity by comparison. Their hosts
were accompanied by an Italian major-domo carrying a staff, by a
quartet of turbaned retainers on motorcycles, and by two
half-veiled females who stood respectfully a little behind Mary
and salaamed at Nicole, making her jump with the gesture.</p>

<p>To Mary as well as to the Divers the greeting was faintly
comic; Mary gave an apologetic, belittling giggle; yet her voice,
as she introduced her husband by his Asiatic title, flew proud
and high.</p>

<p>In their rooms as they dressed for dinner, Dick and Nicole
grimaced at each other in an awed way: such rich as want to be
thought democratic pretend in private to be swept off their feet
by swank.</p>

<p>"Little Mary North knows what she wants," Dick muttered
through his shaving cream. "Abe educated her, and now she's
married to a Buddha. If Europe ever goes Bolshevik she'll turn up
as the bride of Stalin."</p>

<p>Nicole looked around from her dressing-case. "Watch your
tongue, Dick, will you?" But she laughed. "They're very swell.
The warships all fire at them or salute them or something. Mary
rides in the royal bus in London."</p>

<p>"All right," he agreed. As he heard Nicole at the door asking
for pins, he called, "I wonder if I could have some whiskey; I
feel the mountain air!"</p>

<p>"She'll see to it," presently Nicole called through the
bathroom door. "It was one of those women who were at the
station. She has her veil off."</p>

<p>"What did Mary tell you about life?" he asked.</p>

<p>"She didn't say so much&#151;she was interested in high life&#151;she
asked me a lot of questions about my genealogy and all that sort
of thing, as if I knew anything about it. But it seems the
bridegroom has two very tan children by another marriage&#151;one of
them ill with some Asiatic thing they can't diagnose. I've got to
warn the children. Sounds very peculiar to me. Mary will see how
we'd feel about it." She stood worrying a minute.</p>

<p>"She'll understand," Dick reassured her. "Probably the child's
in bed."</p>

<p>At dinner Dick talked to Hosain, who had been at an English
public school. Hosain wanted to know about stocks and about
Hollywood and Dick, whipping up his imagination with champagne,
told him preposterous tales.</p>

<p>"Billions?" Hosain demanded.</p>

<p>"Trillions," Dick assured him.</p>

<p>"I didn't truly realize&#151;"</p>

<p>"Well, perhaps millions," Dick conceded. "Every hotel guest is
assigned a harem&#151;or what amounts to a harem."</p>

<p>"Other than the actors and directors?"</p>

<p>"Every hotel guest&#151;even travelling salesmen. Why, they tried
to send me up a dozen candidates, but Nicole wouldn't stand for
it."</p>

<p>Nicole reproved him when they were in their room alone. "Why
so many highballs? Why did you use your word spic in front of
him?"</p>

<p>"Excuse me, I meant smoke. The tongue slipped."</p>

<p>"Dick, this isn't faintly like you."</p>

<p>"Excuse me again. I'm not much like myself any more."</p>

<p>That night Dick opened a bathroom window, giving on a narrow
and tubular court of the ch√¢teau, gray as rats but echoing
at the moment to plaintive and peculiar music, sad as a flute.
Two men were chanting in an Eastern language or dialect full of
k's and l's&#151;he leaned out but he could not see them; there was
obviously a religious significance in the sounds, and tired and
emotionless he let them pray for him too, but what for, save that
he should not lose himself in his increasing melancholy, he did
not know.</p>

<p>Next day, over a thinly wooded hillside they shot scrawny
birds, distant poor relations to the partridge. It was done in a
vague imitation of the English manner, with a corps of
inexperienced beaters whom Dick managed to miss by firing only
directly overhead.</p>

<p>On their return Lanier was waiting in their suite.</p>

<p>"Father, you said tell you immediately if we were near the
sick boy."</p>

<p>Nicole whirled about, immediately on guard.</p>

<p>"&#151;so, Mother," Lanier continued, turning to her, "the boy
takes a bath every evening and to-night he took his bath just
before mine and I had to take mine in his water, and it was
dirty."</p>

<p>"What? Now what?"</p>

<p>"I saw them take Tony out of it, and then they called me into
it and the water was dirty."</p>

<p>"But&#151;did you take it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Mother."</p>

<p>"Heavens!" she exclaimed to Dick.</p>

<p>He demanded: "Why didn't Lucienne draw your bath?"</p>

<p>"Lucienne can't. It's a funny heater&#151;it reached out of itself
and burned her arm last night and she's afraid of it, so one of
those two women&#151;"</p>

<p>"You go in this bathroom and take a bath now."</p>

<p>"Don't say <i>I</i> told you," said Lanier from the
doorway.</p>

<p>Dick went in and sprinkled the tub with sulphur; closing the
door he said to Nicole:</p>

<p>"Either we speak to Mary or we'd better get out."</p>

<p>She agreed and he continued: "People think their children are
constitutionally cleaner than other people's, and their diseases
are less contagious."</p>

<p>Dick came in and helped himself from the decanter, chewing a
biscuit savagely in the rhythm of the pouring water in the
bathroom.</p>

<p>"Tell Lucienne that she's got to learn about the heater&#151;" he
suggested. At that moment the Asiatic woman came in person to the
door.</p>

<p>"El Contessa&#151;"</p>

<p>Dick beckoned her inside and closed the door.</p>

<p>"Is the little sick boy better?" he inquired pleasantly.</p>

<p>"Better, yes, but he still has the eruptions frequently."</p>

<p>"That's too bad&#151;I'm very sorry. But you see our children
mustn't be bathed in his water. That's out of the question&#151;I'm
sure your mistress would be furious if she had known you had done
a thing like that."</p>

<p>"I?" She seemed thunderstruck. "Why, I merely saw your maid
had difficulty with the heater&#151;I told her about it and started
the water."</p>

<p>"But with a sick person you must empty the bathwater entirely
out, and clean the tub."</p>

<p>"I?"</p>

<p>Chokingly the woman drew a long breath, uttered a convulsed
sob and rushed from the room.</p>

<p>"She mustn't get up on western civilization at our expense,"
he said grimly.</p>

<p>At dinner that night he decided that it must inevitably be a
truncated visit: about his own country Hosain seemed to have
observed only that there were many mountains and some goats and
herders of goats. He was a reserved young man&#151;to draw him out
would have required the sincere effort that Dick now reserved for
his family. Soon after dinner Hosain left Mary and the Divers to
themselves, but the old unity was split&#151;between them lay the
restless social fields that Mary was about to conquer. Dick was
relieved when, at nine-thirty, Mary received and read a note and
got up.</p>

<p>"You'll have to excuse me. My husband is leaving on a short
trip&#151;and I must be with him."</p>

<p>Next morning, hard on the heels of the servant bringing
coffee, Mary entered their room. She was dressed and they were
not dressed, and she had the air of having been up for some time.
Her face was toughened with quiet jerky fury.</p>

<p>"What is this story about Lanier having been bathed in a dirty
bath?"</p>

<p>Dick began to protest, but she cut through:</p>

<p>"What is this story that you commanded my husband's sister to
clean Lanier's tub?"</p>

<p>She remained on her feet staring at them, as they sat impotent
as idols in their beds, weighted by their trays. Together they
exclaimed: "His <i>sister!"</i></p>

<p>"That you ordered one of his sisters to clean out a tub!"</p>

<p>"We didn't&#151;" their voices rang together saying the same
thing, "&#151;I spoke to the native servant&#151;"</p>

<p>"You spoke to Hosain's sister."</p>

<p>Dick could only say: "I supposed they were two maids."</p>

<p>"You were told they were Himadoun."</p>

<p>"What?" Dick got out of bed and into a robe.</p>

<p>"I explained it to you at the piano night before last. Don't
tell me you were too merry to understand."</p>

<p>"Was that what you said? I didn't hear the beginning. I didn't
connect the&#151;we didn't make any connection, Mary. Well, all we
can do is see her and apologize."</p>

<p>"See her and apologize! I explained to you that when the
oldest member of the family&#151;when the oldest one marries, well,
the two oldest sisters consecrate themselves to being Himadoun,
to being his wife's ladies-in-waiting."</p>

<p>"Was that why Hosain left the house last night?"</p>

<p>Mary hesitated; then nodded.</p>

<p>"He had to&#151;they all left. His honor makes it necessary."</p>

<p>Now both the Divers were up and dressing; Mary went on:</p>

<p>"And what's all that about the bathwater. As if a thing like
that could happen in this house! We'll ask Lanier about it."</p>

<p>Dick sat on the bedside indicating in a private gesture to
Nicole that she should take over. Meanwhile Mary went to the door
and spoke to an attendant in Italian.</p>

<p>"Wait a minute," Nicole said. "I won't have that."</p>

<p>"You accused us," answered Mary, in a tone she had never used
to Nicole before. "Now I have a right to see."</p>

<p>"I won't have the child brought in." Nicole threw on her
clothes as though they were chain mail.</p>

<p>"That's all right," said Dick. "Bring Lanier in. We'll settle
this bathtub matter&#151;fact or myth."</p>

<p>Lanier, half clothed mentally and physically, gazed at the
angered faces of the adults.</p>

<p>"Listen, Lanier," Mary demanded, "how did you come to think
you were bathed in water that had been used before?"</p>

<p>"Speak up," Dick added.</p>

<p>"It was just dirty, that was all."</p>

<p>"Couldn't you hear the new water running, from your room, next
door?"</p>

<p>Lanier admitted the possibility but reiterated his point&#151;the
water was dirty. He was a little awed; he tried to see ahead:</p>

<p>"It couldn't have been running, because&#151;"</p>

<p>They pinned him down.</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>He stood in his little kimono arousing the sympathy of his
parents and further arousing Mary's impatience&#151;then he said:</p>

<p>"The water was dirty, it was full of soap-suds."</p>

<p>"When you're not sure what you're saying&#151;" Mary began, but
Nicole interrupted.</p>

<p>"Stop it, Mary. If there were dirty suds in the water it was
logical to think it was dirty. His father told him to come&#151;"</p>

<p>"There couldn't have been dirty suds in the water."</p>

<p>Lanier looked reproachfully at his father, who had betrayed
him. Nicole turned him about by the shoulders and sent him out of
the room; Dick broke the tensity with a laugh.</p>

<p>Then, as if the sound recalled the past, the old friendship,
Mary guessed how far away from them she had gone and said in a
mollifying tone: "It's always like that with children."</p>

<p>Her uneasiness grew as she remembered the past. "You'd be
silly to go&#151;Hosain wanted to make this trip anyhow. After all,
you're my guests and you just blundered into the thing." But
Dick, made more angry by this obliqueness and the use of the word
blunder, turned away and began arranging his effects, saying:</p>

<p>"It's too bad about the young women. I'd like to apologize to
the one who came in here."</p>

<p>"If you'd only listened on the piano seat!"</p>

<p>"But you've gotten so damned dull, Mary. I listened as long as
I could."</p>

<p>"Be quiet!" Nicole advised him.</p>

<p>"I return his compliment," said Mary bitterly. "Good-by,
Nicole." She went out.</p>

<p>After all that there was no question of her coming to see them
off; the major-domo arranged the departure. Dick left formal
notes for Hosain and the sisters. There was nothing to do except
to go, but all of them, especially Lanier, felt bad about it.</p>

<p>"I insist," insisted Lanier on the train, "that it was dirty
bathwater."</p>

<p>"That'll do," his father said. "You better forget it&#151;unless
you want me to divorce you. Did you know there was a new law in
France that you can divorce a child?"</p>

<p>Lanier roared with delight and the Divers were unified
again&#151;Dick wondered how many more times it could be done.</p>
