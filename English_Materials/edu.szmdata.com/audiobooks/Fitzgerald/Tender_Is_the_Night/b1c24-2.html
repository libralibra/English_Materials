<p class="storyTitle">XXIV</p>





<p>With his miniature leather brief-case in his hand Richard
Diver walked from the seventh arrondisement&#151;where he left a note
for Maria Wallis signed "Dicole," the word with which he and
Nicole had signed communications in the first days of love&#151;to
his shirt-makers where the clerks made a fuss over him out of
proportion to the money he spent. Ashamed at promising so much to
these poor Englishmen, with his fine manners, his air of having
the key to security, ashamed of making a tailor shift an inch of
silk on his arm. Afterward he went to the bar of the Crillon and
drank a small coffee and two fingers of gin.</p>

<p>As he entered the hotel the halls had seemed unnaturally
bright; when he left he realized that it was because it had
already turned dark outside. It was a windy four-o'clock night
with the leaves on the Champs Élysées singing and
failing, thin and wild. Dick turned down the Rue de Rivoli,
walking two squares under the arcades to his bank where there was
mail. Then he took a taxi and started up the Champs
Élysées through the first patter of rain, sitting
alone with his love.</p>

<p>Back at two o'clock in the Roi George corridor the beauty of
Nicole had been to the beauty of Rosemary as the beauty of
Leonardo's girl was to that of the girl of an illustrator. Dick
moved on through the rain, demoniac and frightened, the passions
of many men inside him and nothing simple that he could see.</p>





<p>Rosemary opened her door full of emotions no one else knew of.
She was now what is sometimes called a "little wild thing"&#151;by
twenty-four full hours she was not yet unified and she was
absorbed in playing around with chaos; as if her destiny were a
picture puzzle&#151;counting benefits, counting hopes, telling off
Dick, Nicole, her mother, the director she met yesterday, like
stops on a string of beads.</p>

<p>When Dick knocked she had just dressed and been watching the
rain, thinking of some poem, and of full gutters in Beverly
Hills. When she opened the door she saw him as something fixed
and Godlike as he had always been, as older people are to
younger, rigid and unmalleable. Dick saw her with an inevitable
sense of disappointment. It took him a moment to respond to the
unguarded sweetness of her smile, her body calculated to a
millimeter to suggest a bud yet guarantee a flower. He was
conscious of the print of her wet foot on a rug through the
bathroom door.</p>

<p>"Miss Television," he said with a lightness he did not feel.
He put his gloves, his brief-case on the dressing-table, his
stick against the wall. His chin dominated the lines of pain
around his mouth, forcing them up into his forehead and the
corner of his eyes, like fear that cannot be shown in public.</p>

<p>"Come and sit on my lap close to me," he said softly, "and let
me see about your lovely mouth."</p>

<p>She came over and sat there and while the dripping slowed down
outside&#151;drip&#151;dri-i-ip, she laid her lips to the beautiful cold
image she had created.</p>

<p>Presently she kissed him several times in the mouth, her face
getting big as it came up to him; he had never seen anything so
dazzling as the quality of her skin, and since sometimes beauty
gives back the images of one's best thoughts he thought of his
responsibility about Nicole, and of the responsibility of her
being two doors down across the corridor.</p>

<p>"The rain's over," he said. "Do you see the sun on the
slate?"</p>

<p>Rosemary stood up and leaned down and said her most sincere
thing to him:</p>

<p>"Oh, we're such <i>actors</i>&#151;you and I."</p>

<p>She went to her dresser and the moment that she laid her comb
flat against her hair there was a slow persistent knocking at the
door.</p>

<p>They were shocked motionless; the knock was repeated
insistently, and in the sudden realization that the door was not
locked Rosemary finished her hair with one stroke, nodded at Dick
who had quickly jerked the wrinkles out of the bed where they had
been sitting, and started for the door. Dick said in quite a
natural voice, not too loud:</p>

<p>"&#151;so if you don't feel up to going out, I'll tell Nicole and
we'll have a very quiet last evening."</p>

<p>The precautions were needless for the situation of the parties
outside the door was so harassed as to preclude any but the most
fleeting judgments on matters not pertinent to themselves.
Standing there was Abe, aged by several months in the last
twenty-four hours, and a very frightened, concerned colored man
whom Abe introduced as Mr. Peterson of Stockholm.</p>

<p>"He's in a terrible situation and it's my fault," said Abe.
"We need some good advice."</p>

<p>"Come in our rooms," said Dick.</p>

<p>Abe insisted that Rosemary come too and they crossed the hall
to the Divers' suite. Jules Peterson, a small, respectable Negro,
on the suave model that heels the Republican party in the border
States, followed.</p>

<p>It appeared that the latter had been a legal witness to the
early morning dispute in Montparnasse; he had accompanied Abe to
the police station and supported his assertion that a thousand
franc note had been seized out of his hand by a Negro, whose
identification was one of the points of the case. Abe and Jules
Peterson, accompanied by an agent of police, returned to the
bistro and too hastily identified as the criminal a Negro, who,
so it was established after an hour, had only entered the place
after Abe left. The police had further complicated the situation
by arresting the prominent Negro restaurateur, Freeman, who had
only drifted through the alcoholic fog at a very early stage and
then vanished. The true culprit, whose case, as reported by his
friends, was that he had merely commandeered a fifty-franc note
to pay for drinks that Abe had ordered, had only recently and in
a somewhat sinister rôle, reappeared upon the scene.</p>

<p>In brief, Abe had succeeded in the space of an hour in
entangling himself with the personal lives, consciences, and
emotions of one Afro-European and three Afro-Americans inhabiting
the French Latin quarter. The disentanglement was not even
faintly in sight and the day had passed in an atmosphere of
unfamiliar Negro faces bobbing up in unexpected places and around
unexpected corners, and insistent Negro voices on the phone.</p>

<p>In person, Abe had succeeded in evading all of them, save
Jules Peterson. Peterson was rather in the position of the
friendly Indian who had helped a white. The Negroes who suffered
from the betrayal were not so much after Abe as after Peterson,
and Peterson was very much after what protection he might get
from Abe.</p>

<p>Up in Stockholm Peterson had failed as a small manufacturer of
shoe polish and now possessed only his formula and sufficient
trade tools to fill a small box; however, his new protector had
promised in the early hours to set him up in business in
Versailles. Abe's former chauffeur was a shoemaker there and Abe
had handed Peterson two hundred francs on account.</p>

<p>Rosemary listened with distaste to this rigmarole; to
appreciate its grotesquerie required a more robust sense of humor
than hers. The little man with his portable manufactory, his
insincere eyes that, from time to time, rolled white semicircles
of panic into view; the figure of Abe, his face as blurred as the
gaunt fine lines of it would permit&#151;all this was as remote from
her as sickness.</p>

<p>"I ask only a chance in life," said Peterson with the sort of
precise yet distorted intonation peculiar to colonial countries.
"My methods are simple, my formula is so good that I was drove
away from Stockholm, ruined, because I did not care to dispose of
it."</p>

<p>Dick regarded him politely&#151;interest formed, dissolved, he
turned to Abe:</p>

<p>"You go to some hotel and go to bed. After you're all straight
Mr. Peterson will come and see you."</p>

<p>"But don't you appreciate the mess that Peterson's in?" Abe
protested.</p>

<p>"I shall wait in the hall," said Mr. Peterson with delicacy.
"It is perhaps hard to discuss my problems in front of me."</p>

<p>He withdrew after a short travesty of a French bow; Abe pulled
himself to his feet with the deliberation of a locomotive.</p>

<p>"I don't seem highly popular to-day."</p>

<p>"Popular but not probable," Dick advised him. "My advice is to
leave this hotel&#151;by way of the bar, if you want. Go to the
Chambord, or if you'll need a lot of service, go over to the
Majestic."</p>

<p>"Could I annoy you for a drink?"</p>

<p>"There's not a thing up here," Dick lied.</p>

<p>Resignedly Abe shook hands with Rosemary; he composed his face
slowly, holding her hand a long time and forming sentences that
did not emerge.</p>

<p>"You are the most&#151;one of the most&#151;"</p>

<p>She was sorry, and rather revolted at his dirty hands, but she
laughed in a well-bred way, as though it were nothing unusual to
her to watch a man walking in a slow dream. Often people display
a curious respect for a man drunk, rather like the respect of
simple races for the insane. Respect rather than fear. There is
something awe-inspiring in one who has lost all inhibitions, who
will do anything. Of course we make him pay afterward for his
moment of superiority, his moment of impressiveness. Abe turned
to Dick with a last appeal.</p>

<p>"If I go to a hotel and get all steamed and curry-combed, and
sleep awhile, and fight off these Senegalese&#151;could I come and
spend the evening by the fireside?"</p>

<p>Dick nodded at him, less in agreement than in mockery and
said: "You have a high opinion of your current capacities."</p>

<p>"I bet if Nicole was here she'd let me come back."</p>

<p>"All right." Dick went to a trunk tray and brought a box to
the central table; inside were innumerable cardboard letters.</p>

<p>"You can come if you want to play anagrams."</p>

<p>Abe eyed the contents of the box with physical revulsion, as
though he had been asked to eat them like oats.</p>

<p>"What are anagrams? Haven't I had enough strange&#151;"</p>

<p>"It's a quiet game. You spell words with them&#151;any word except
alcohol."</p>

<p>"I bet you can spell alcohol," Abe plunged his hand among the
counters. "Can I come back if I can spell alcohol?"</p>

<p>"You can come back if you want to play anagrams."</p>

<p>Abe shook his head resignedly.</p>

<p>"If you're in that frame of mind there's no use&#151;I'd just be
in the way." He waved his finger reproachfully at Dick. "But
remember what George the third said, that if Grant was drunk he
wished he would bite the other generals."</p>

<p>With a last desperate glance at Rosemary from the golden
corners of his eyes, he went out. To his relief Peterson was no
longer in the corridor. Feeling lost and homeless he went back to
ask Paul the name of that boat.</p>
