<p class="storyTitle">XIX</p>





<p>For an hour, tied up with his profound reaction to his
father's death, the magnificent façade of the homeland,
the harbor of New York, seemed all sad and glorious to Dick, but
once ashore the feeling vanished, nor did he find it again in the
streets or the hotels or the trains that bore him first to
Buffalo, and then south to Virginia with his father's body. Only
as the local train shambled into the low-forested clayland of
Westmoreland County, did he feel once more identified with his
surroundings; at the station he saw a star he knew, and a cold
moon bright over Chesapeake Bay; he heard the rasping wheels of
buckboards turning, the lovely fatuous voices, the sound of
sluggish primeval rivers flowing softly under soft Indian
names.</p>

<p>Next day at the churchyard his father was laid among a hundred
Divers, Dorseys, and Hunters. It was very friendly leaving him
there with all his relations around him. Flowers were scattered
on the brown unsettled earth. Dick had no more ties here now and
did not believe he would come back. He knelt on the hard soil.
These dead, he knew them all, their weather-beaten faces with
blue flashing eyes, the spare violent bodies, the souls made of
new earth in the forest-heavy darkness of the seventeenth
century.</p>

<p>"Good-by, my father&#151;good-by, all my fathers."</p>





<p>On the long-roofed steamship piers one is in a country that is
no longer here and not yet there. The hazy yellow vault is full
of echoing shouts. There are the rumble of trucks and the clump
of trunks, the strident chatter of cranes, the first salt smell
of the sea. One hurries through, even though there's time; the
past, the continent, is behind; the future is the glowing mouth
in the side of the ship; the dim, turbulent alley is too
confusedly the present.</p>

<p>Up the gangplank and the vision of the world adjusts itself,
narrows. One is a citizen of a commonwealth smaller than Andorra,
no longer sure of anything. The men at the purser's desk are as
oddly shaped as the cabins; disdainful are the eyes of voyagers
and their friends. Next the loud mournful whistles, the
portentous vibration and the boat, the human idea&#151;is in motion.
The pier and its faces slide by and for a moment the boat is a
piece accidentally split off from them; the faces become remote,
voiceless, the pier is one of many blurs along the water front.
The harbor flows swiftly toward the sea.</p>

<p>With it flowed Albert McKisco, labelled by the newspapers as
its most precious cargo. McKisco was having a vogue. His novels
were pastiches of the work of the best people of his time, a feat
not to be disparaged, and in addition he possessed a gift for
softening and debasing what he borrowed, so that many readers
were charmed by the ease with which they could follow him.
Success had improved him and humbled him. He was no fool about
his capacities&#151;he realized that he possessed more vitality than
many men of superior talent, and he was resolved to enjoy the
success he had earned. "I've done nothing yet," he would say. "I
don't think I've got any real genius. But if I keep trying I may
write a good book." Fine dives have been made from flimsier
spring-boards. The innumerable snubs of the past were forgotten.
Indeed, his success was founded psychologically upon his duel
with Tommy Barban, upon the basis of which, as it withered in his
memory, he had created, afresh, a new self-respect.</p>

<p>Spotting Dick Diver the second day out, he eyed him
tentatively, then introduced himself in a friendly way and sat
down. Dick laid aside his reading and, after the few minutes that
it took to realize the change in McKisco, the disappearance of
the man's annoying sense of inferiority, found himself pleased to
talk to him. McKisco was "well-informed" on a range of subjects
wider than Goethe's&#151;it was interesting to listen to the
innumerable facile combinations that he referred to as his
opinions. They struck up an acquaintance, and Dick had several
meals with them. The McKiscos had been invited to sit at the
captain's table but with nascent snobbery they told Dick that
they "couldn't stand that bunch."</p>

<p>Violet was very grand now, decked out by the grand
couturières, charmed about the little discoveries that
well-bred girls make in their teens. She could, indeed, have
learned them from her mother in Boise but her soul was born
dismally in the small movie houses of Idaho, and she had had no
time for her mother. Now she "belonged"&#151;together with several
million other people&#151;and she was happy, though her husband still
shushed her when she grew violently naïve.</p>

<p>The McKiscos got off at Gibraltar. Next evening in Naples Dick
picked up a lost and miserable family of two girls and their
mother in the bus from the hotel to the station. He had seen them
on the ship. An overwhelming desire to help, or to be admired,
came over him: he showed them fragments of gaiety; tentatively he
bought them wine, with pleasure saw them begin to regain their
proper egotism. He pretended they were this and that, and falling
in with his own plot, and drinking too much to sustain the
illusion, and all this time the women, thought only that this was
a windfall from heaven. He withdrew from them as the night waned
and the train rocked and snorted at Cassino and Frosinone. After
weird American partings in the station at Rome, Dick went to the
Hotel Quirinal, somewhat exhausted.</p>

<p>At the desk he suddenly stared and upped his head. As if a
drink were acting on him, warming the lining of his stomach,
throwing a flush up into his brain, he saw the person he had come
to see, the person for whom he had made the Mediterranean
crossing.</p>

<p>Simultaneously Rosemary saw him, acknowledging him before
placing him; she looked back startled, and, leaving the girl she
was with, she hurried over. Holding himself erect, holding his
breath, Dick turned to her. As she came across the lobby, her
beauty all groomed, like a young horse dosed with Black-seed oil,
and hoops varnished, shocked him awake; but it all came too quick
for him to do anything except conceal his fatigue as best he
could. To meet her starry-eyed confidence he mustered an
insincere pantomime implying, "You <i>would</i> turn up here&#151;of
all the people in the world."</p>

<p>Her gloved hands closed over his on the desk; "Dick&#151;we're
making <i>The Grandeur that was Rome</i>&#151;at least we think we
are; we may quit any day."</p>

<p>He looked at her hard, trying to make her a little
self-conscious, so that she would observe less closely his
unshaven face, his crumpled and slept-in collar. Fortunately, she
was in a hurry.</p>

<p>"We begin early because the mists rise at eleven&#151;phone me at
two."</p>

<p>In his room Dick collected his faculties. He left a call for
noon, stripped off his clothes and dove literally into a heavy
sleep.</p>

<p>He slept over the phone call but awoke at two, refreshed.
Unpacking his bag, he sent out suits and laundry. He shaved, lay
for half an hour in a warm bath and had breakfast. The sun had
dipped into the Via Nazionale and he let it through the
portières with a jingling of old brass rings. Waiting for
a suit to be pressed, he discovered from the Corriere della Sera
that "una novella di Sinclair Lewis 'Wall Street' nella quale
autore analizza la vita sociale di una piccola citta Americana."
Then he tried to think about Rosemary.</p>

<p>At first he thought nothing. She was young and magnetic, but
so was Topsy. He guessed that she had had lovers and had loved
them in the last four years. Well, you never knew exactly how
much space you occupied in people's lives. Yet from this fog his
affection emerged&#151;the best contacts are when one knows the
obstacles and still wants to preserve a relation. The past
drifted back and he wanted to hold her eloquent giving-of-herself
in its precious shell, till he enclosed it, till it no longer
existed outside him. He tried to collect all that might attract
her&#151;it was less than it had been four years ago. Eighteen might
look at thirty-four through a rising mist of adolescence; but
twenty-two would see thirty-eight with discerning clarity.
Moreover, Dick had been at an emotional peak at the time of the
previous encounter; since then there had been a lesion of
enthusiasm.</p>

<p>When the valet returned he put on a white shirt and collar and
a black tie with a pearl; the cords of his reading-glasses passed
through another pearl of the same size that swung a casual inch
below. After sleep, his face had resumed the ruddy brown of many
Riviera summers, and to limber himself up he stood on his hands
on a chair until his fountain pen and coins fell out. At three he
called Rosemary and was bidden to come up. Momentarily dizzy from
his acrobatics, he stopped in the bar for a gin-and-tonic.</p>

<p>"Hi, Doctor Diver!"</p>

<p>Only because of Rosemary's presence in the hotel did Dick
place the man immediately as Collis Clay. He had his old
confidence and an air of prosperity and big sudden jowls.</p>

<p>"Do you know Rosemary's here?" Collis asked.</p>

<p>"I ran into her."</p>

<p>"I was in Florence and I heard she was here so I came down
last week. You'd never know Mama's little girl." He modified the
remark, "I mean she was so carefully brought up and now she's a
woman of the world&#151;if you know what I mean. Believe me, has she
got some of these Roman boys tied up in bags! And how!"</p>

<p>"You studying in Florence?"</p>

<p>"Me? Sure, I'm studying architecture there. I go back
Sunday&#151;I'm staying for the races."</p>

<p>With difficulty Dick restrained him from adding the drink to
the account he carried in the bar, like a stock-market
report.</p>
