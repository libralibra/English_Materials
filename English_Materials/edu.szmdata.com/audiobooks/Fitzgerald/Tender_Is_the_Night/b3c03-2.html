<p class="storyTitle">III</p>





<p>One morning a week later, stopping at the desk for his mail,
Dick became aware of some extra commotion outside: Patient Von
Cohn Morris was going away. His parents, Australians, were
putting his baggage vehemently into a large limousine, and beside
them stood Doctor Ladislau protesting with ineffectual attitudes
against the violent gesturings of Morris, senior. The young man
was regarding his embarkation with aloof cynicism as Doctor Diver
approached.</p>

<p>"Isn't this a little sudden, Mr. Morris?"</p>

<p>Mr. Morris started as he saw Dick&#151;his florid face and the
large checks on his suit seemed to turn off and on like electric
lights. He approached Dick as though to strike him.</p>

<p>"High time we left, we and those who have come with us," he
began, and paused for breath. "It is high time, Doctor Diver.
High time."</p>

<p>"Will you come in my office?" Dick suggested.</p>

<p>"Not I! I'll talk to you, but I'm washing my hands of you and
your place."</p>

<p>He shook his finger at Dick. "I was just telling this doctor
here. We've wasted our time and our money."</p>

<p>Doctor Ladislau stirred in a feeble negative, signalling up a
vague Slavic evasiveness. Dick had never liked Ladislau. He
managed to walk the excited Australian along the path in the
direction of his office, trying to persuade him to enter; but the
man shook his head.</p>

<p>"It's you, Doctor Diver, <i>you,</i> the very man. I went to
Doctor Ladislau because you were not to be found, Doctor Diver,
and because Doctor Gregorovius is not expected until the
nightfall, and I would not wait. No, sir! I would not wait a
minute after my son told me the truth."</p>

<p>He came up menacingly to Dick, who kept his hands loose enough
to drop him if it seemed necessary. "My son is here for
alcoholism, and he told us he smelt liquor on your breath. Yes,
sir!" He made a quick, apparently unsuccessful sniff. "Not once,
but twice Von Cohn says he has smelt liquor on your breath. I and
my lady have never touched a drop of it in our lives. We hand Von
Cohn to you to be cured, and within a month he twice smells
liquor on your breath! What kind of cure is that there?"</p>

<p>Dick hesitated; Mr. Morris was quite capable of making a scene
on the clinic drive.</p>

<p>"After all, Mr. Morris, some people are not going to give up
what they regard as food because of your son&#151;"</p>

<p>"But you're a doctor, man!" cried Morris furiously. "When the
workmen drink their beer that's bad 'cess to them&#151;but you're
here supposing to cure&#151;"</p>

<p>"This has gone too far. Your son came to us because of
kleptomania."</p>

<p>"What was behind it?" The man was almost shrieking.
"Drink&#151;black drink. Do you know what color black is? It's black!
My own uncle was hung by the neck because of it, you hear? My son
comes to a sanitarium, and a doctor reeks of it!"</p>

<p>"I must ask you to leave."</p>

<p>"You <i>ask</i> me! We <i>are</i> leaving!"</p>

<p>"If you could be a little temperate we could tell you the
results of the treatment to date. Naturally, since you feel as
you do, we would not want your son as a patient&#151;"</p>

<p>"You dare to use the word temperate to me?"</p>

<p>Dick called to Doctor Ladislau and as he approached, said:
"Will you represent us in saying good-by to the patient and to
his family?"</p>

<p>He bowed slightly to Morris and went into his office, and
stood rigid for a moment just inside the door. He watched until
they drove away, the gross parents, the bland, degenerate
offspring: it was easy to prophesy the family's swing around
Europe, bullying their betters with hard ignorance and hard
money. But what absorbed Dick after the disappearance of the
caravan was the question as to what extent he had provoked this.
He drank claret with each meal, took a nightcap, generally in the
form of hot rum, and sometimes he tippled with gin in the
afternoons&#151;gin was the most difficult to detect on the breath.
He was averaging a half-pint of alcohol a day, too much for his
system to burn up.</p>

<p>Dismissing a tendency to justify himself, he sat down at his
desk and wrote out, like a prescription, a r√©gime that
would cut his liquor in half. Doctors, chauffeurs, and Protestant
clergymen could never smell of liquor, as could painters,
brokers, cavalry leaders; Dick blamed himself only for
indiscretion. But the matter was by no means clarified half an
hour later when Franz, revivified by an Alpine fortnight, rolled
up the drive, so eager to resume work that he was plunged in it
before he reached his office. Dick met him there.</p>

<p>"How was Mount Everest?"</p>

<p>"We could very well have done Mount Everest the rate we were
doing. We thought of it. How goes it all? How is my Kaethe, how
is your Nicole?"</p>

<p>"All goes smooth domestically. But my God, Franz, we had a
rotten scene this morning."</p>

<p>"How? What was it?"</p>

<p>Dick walked around the room while Franz got in touch with his
villa by telephone. After the family exchange was over, Dick
said: "The Morris boy was taken away&#151;there was a row."</p>

<p>Franz's buoyant face fell.</p>

<p>"I knew he'd left. I met Ladislau on the veranda."</p>

<p>"What did Ladislau say?"</p>

<p>"Just that young Morris had gone&#151;that you'd tell me about it.
What about it?"</p>

<p>"The usual incoherent reasons."</p>

<p>"He was a devil, that boy."</p>

<p>"He was a case for anesthesia," Dick agreed. "Anyhow, the
father had beaten Ladislau into a colonial subject by the time I
came along. What about Ladislau? Do we keep him? I say no&#151;he's
not much of a man, he can't seem to cope with anything." Dick
hesitated on the verge of the truth, swung away to give himself
space within which to recapitulate. Franz perched on the edge of
a desk, still in his linen duster and travelling gloves. Dick
said:</p>

<p>"One of the remarks the boy made to his father was that your
distinguished collaborator was a drunkard. The man is a fanatic,
and the descendant seems to have caught traces of vin-du-pays on
me."</p>

<p>Franz sat down, musing on his lower lip. "You can tell me at
length," he said finally.</p>

<p>"Why not now?" Dick suggested. "You must know I'm the last man
to abuse liquor." His eyes and Franz's glinted on each other,
pair on pair. "Ladislau let the man get so worked up that I was
on the defensive. It might have happened in front of patients,
and you can imagine how hard it could be to defend yourself in a
situation like that!"</p>

<p>Franz took off his gloves and coat. He went to the door and
told the secretary, "Don't disturb us." Coming back into the room
he flung himself at the long table and fooled with his mail,
reasoning as little as is characteristic of people in such
postures, rather summoning up a suitable mask for what he had to
say.</p>

<p>"Dick, I know well that you are a temperate, well-balanced
man, even though we do not entirely agree on the subject of
alcohol. But a time has come&#151;Dick, I must say frankly that I
have been aware several times that you have had a drink when it
was not the moment to have one. There is some reason. Why not try
another leave of abstinence?"</p>

<p>"Absence," Dick corrected him automatically. "It's no solution
for me to go away."</p>

<p>They were both chafed, Franz at having his return marred and
blurred.</p>

<p>"Sometimes you don't use your common sense, Dick."</p>

<p>"I never understood what common sense meant applied to
complicated problems&#151;unless it means that a general practitioner
can perform a better operation than a specialist."</p>

<p>He was seized by an overwhelming disgust for the situation. To
explain, to patch&#151;these were not natural functions at their
age&#151;better to continue with the cracked echo of an old truth in
the ears.</p>

<p>"This is no go," he said suddenly.</p>

<p>"Well, that's occurred to me," Franz admitted. "Your heart
isn't in this project any more, Dick."</p>

<p>"I know. I want to leave&#151;we could strike some arrangement
about taking Nicole's money out gradually."</p>

<p>"I have thought about that too, Dick&#151;I have seen this coming.
I am able to arrange other backing, and it will be possible to
take all your money out by the end of the year."</p>

<p>Dick had not intended to come to a decision so quickly, nor
was he prepared for Franz's so ready acquiescence in the break,
yet he was relieved. Not without desperation he had long felt the
ethics of his profession dissolving into a lifeless mass.</p>
