<p>Nicole awoke late, murmuring something back into her dream
before she parted her long lashes tangled with sleep. Dick's bed
was empty&#151;only after a minute did she realize that she had been
awakened by a knock at their salon door.</p>

<p>"Entrez!" she called, but there was no answer, and after a
moment she slipped on a dressing-gown and went to open it. A
sergent-de-ville confronted her courteously and stepped inside
the door.</p>

<p>"Mr. Afghan North&#151;he is here?"</p>

<p>"What? No&#151;he's gone to America."</p>

<p>"When did he leave, Madame?"</p>

<p>"Yesterday morning."</p>

<p>He shook his head and waved his forefinger at her in a quicker
rhythm.</p>

<p>"He was in Paris last night. He is registered here but his
room is not occupied. They told me I had better ask at this
room."</p>

<p>"Sounds very peculiar to me&#151;we saw him off yesterday morning
on the boat train."</p>

<p>"Be that as it may, he has been seen here this morning. Even
his carte d'identité has been seen. And there you
are."</p>

<p>"We know nothing about it," she proclaimed in amazement.</p>

<p>He considered. He was an ill-smelling, handsome man.</p>

<p>"You were not with him at all last night?"</p>

<p>"But no."</p>

<p>"We have arrested a Negro. We are convinced we have at last
arrested the correct Negro."</p>

<p>"I assure you that I haven't an idea what you're talking
about. If it's the Mr. Abraham North, the one we know, well, if
he was in Paris last night we weren't aware of it."</p>

<p>The man nodded, sucked his upper lip, convinced but
disappointed.</p>

<p>"What happened?" Nicole demanded.</p>

<p>He showed his palms, puffing out his closed mouth. He had
begun to find her attractive and his eyes flickered at her.</p>

<p>"What do you wish, Madame? A summer affair. Mr. Afghan North
was robbed and he made a complaint. We have arrested the
miscreant. Mr. Afghan should come to identify him and make the
proper charges."</p>

<p>Nicole pulled her dressing-gown closer around her and
dismissed him briskly. Mystified she took a bath and dressed. By
this time it was after ten and she called Rosemary but got no
answer&#151;then she phoned the hotel office and found that Abe had
indeed registered, at six-thirty this morning. His room, however,
was still unoccupied. Hoping for a word from Dick she waited in
the parlor of the suite; just as she had given up and decided to
go out, the office called and announced:</p>

<p>"Meestaire Crawshow, un nègre."</p>

<p>"On what business?" she demanded.</p>

<p>"He says he knows you and the doctaire. He says there is a
Meestaire Freeman into prison that is a friend of all the world.
He says there is injustice and he wishes to see Meestaire North
before he himself is arrested."</p>

<p>"We know nothing about it." Nicole disclaimed the whole
business with a vehement clap of the receiver. Abe's bizarre
reappearance made it plain to her how fatigued she was with his
dissipation. Dismissing him from her mind she went out, ran into
Rosemary at the dressmaker's, and shopped with her for artificial
flowers and all-colored strings of colored beads on the Rue de
Rivoli. She helped Rosemary choose a diamond for her mother, and
some scarfs and novel cigarette cases to take home to business
associates in California. For her son she bought Greek and Roman
soldiers, a whole army of them, costing over a thousand francs.
Once again they spent their money in different ways and again
Rosemary admired Nicole's method of spending. Nicole was sure
that the money she spent was hers&#151;Rosemary still thought her
money was miraculously lent to her and she must consequently be
very careful of it.</p>

<p>It was fun spending money in the sunlight of the foreign city
with healthy bodies under them that sent streams of color up to
their faces; with arms and hands, legs and ankles that they
stretched out confidently, reaching or stepping with the
confidence of women lovely to men.</p>

<p>When they got back to the hotel and found Dick, all bright and
new in the morning, both of them had a moment of complete
childish joy.</p>

<p>He had just received a garbled telephone call from Abe who, so
it appeared, had spent the forenoon in hiding.</p>

<p>"It was one of the most extraordinary telephone conversations
I've ever held."</p>

<p>Dick had talked not only to Abe but to a dozen others. On the
phone these supernumeraries had been typically introduced as:
"&#151;man wants to talk to you is in the teput dome, well he says he
was in it&#151;what is it?</p>

<p>"Hey, somebody, shut-up&#151;anyhow, he was in some
shandel-scandal and he kaa <i>pos</i>sibly go home. My own
<i>per</i>sonal is that&#151;my personal is he's had a&#151;" Gulps
sounded and thereafter what the party had, rested with the
unknown.</p>

<p>The phone yielded up a supplementary offer:</p>

<p>"I thought it would appeal to you anyhow as a psychologist."
The vague personality who corresponded to this statement was
eventually hung on to the phone; in the sequence he failed to
appeal to Dick, as a psychologist, or indeed as anything else.
Abe's conversation flowed on as follows:</p>

<p>"Hello."</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"Well, hello."</p>

<p>"Who are you?"</p>

<p>"Well." There were interpolated snorts of laughter.</p>

<p>"Well, I'll put somebody else on the line."</p>

<p>Sometimes Dick could hear Abe's voice, accompanied by
scufflings, droppings of the receiver, far-away fragments such
as, "No, I don't, Mr. North. . . ." Then a pert decided voice had
said: "If you are a friend of Mr. North you will come down and
take him away."</p>

<p>Abe cut in, solemn and ponderous, beating it all down with an
overtone of earth-bound determination.</p>

<p>"Dick, I've launched a race riot in Montmartre. I'm going over
and get Freeman out of jail. If a Negro from Copenhagen that
makes shoe polish&#151;hello, can you hear me&#151;well, look, if anybody
comes there&#151;" Once again the receiver was a chorus of
innumerable melodies.</p>

<p>"Why you back in Paris?" Dick demanded.</p>

<p>"I got as far as Evreux, and I decided to take a plane back so
I could compare it with St. Sulpice. I mean I don't intend to
bring St. Sulpice back to Paris. I don't even mean Baroque! I
meant St. Germain. For God's sake, wait a minute and I'll put the
chasseur on the wire."</p>

<p>"For God's sake, don't."</p>

<p>"Listen&#151;did Mary get off all right?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Dick, I want you to talk with a man I met here this morning,
the son of a naval officer that's been to every doctor in Europe.
Let me tell you about him&#151;"</p>

<p>Dick had rung off at this point&#151;perhaps that was a piece of
ingratitude for he needed grist for the grinding activity of his
mind.</p>

<p>"Abe used to be so nice," Nicole told Rosemary. "So nice. Long
ago&#151;when Dick and I were first married. If you had known him
then. He'd come to stay with us for weeks and weeks and we
scarcely knew he was in the house. Sometimes he'd play&#151;sometimes
he'd be in the library with a muted piano, making love to it by
the hour&#151;Dick, do you remember that maid? She thought he was a
ghost and sometimes Abe used to meet her in the hall and moo at
her, and it cost us a whole tea service once&#151;but we didn't
care."</p>

<p>So much fun&#151;so long ago. Rosemary envied them their fun,
imagining a life of leisure unlike her own. She knew little of
leisure but she had the respect for it of those who have never
had it. She thought of it as a resting, without realizing that
the Divers were as far from relaxing as she was herself.</p>

<p>"What did this to him?" she asked. "Why does he have to
drink?"</p>

<p>Nicole shook her head right and left, disclaiming
responsibility for the matter: "So many smart men go to pieces
nowadays."</p>

<p>"And when haven't they?" Dick asked. "Smart men play close to
the line because they have to&#151;some of them can't stand it, so
they quit."</p>

<p>"It must lie deeper than that." Nicole clung to her
conversation; also she was irritated that Dick should contradict
her before Rosemary. "Artists like&#151;well, like Fernand don't seem
to have to wallow in alcohol. Why is it just Americans who
dissipate?"</p>

<p>There were so many answers to this question that Dick decided
to leave it in the air, to buzz victoriously in Nicole's ears. He
had become intensely critical of her. Though he thought she was
the most attractive human creature he had ever seen, though he
got from her everything he needed, he scented battle from afar,
and subconsciously he had been hardening and arming himself, hour
by hour. He was not given to self-indulgence and he felt
comparatively graceless at this moment of indulging himself,
blinding his eyes with the hope that Nicole guessed at only an
emotional excitement about Rosemary. He was not sure&#151;last night
at the theatre she had referred pointedly to Rosemary as a
child.</p>

<p>The trio lunched downstairs in an atmosphere of carpets and
padded waiters, who did not march at the stomping quick-step of
those men who brought good food to the tables whereon they had
recently dined. Here there were families of Americans staring
around at families of Americans, and trying to make conversation
with one another.</p>

<p>There was a party at the next table that they could not
account for. It consisted of an expansive, somewhat secretarial,
would-you-mind-repeating young man, and a score of women. The
women were neither young nor old nor of any particular social
class; yet the party gave the impression of a unit, held more
closely together for example than a group of wives stalling
through a professional congress of their husbands. Certainly it
was more of a unit than any conceivable tourist party.</p>

<p>An instinct made Dick suck back the grave derision that formed
on his tongue; he asked the waiter to find out who they were.</p>

<p>"Those are the gold-star muzzers," explained the waiter.</p>

<p>Aloud and in low voices they exclaimed. Rosemary's eyes filled
with tears.</p>

<p>"Probably the young ones are the wives," said Nicole.</p>

<p>Over his wine Dick looked at them again; in their happy faces,
the dignity that surrounded and pervaded the party, he perceived
all the maturity of an older America. For a while the sobered
women who had come to mourn for their dead, for something they
could not repair, made the room beautiful. Momentarily, he sat
again on his father's knee, riding with Moseby while the old
loyalties and devotions fought on around him. Almost with an
effort he turned back to his two women at the table and faced the
whole new world in which he believed.</p>

<p>&#151;Do you mind if I pull down the curtain?</p>
