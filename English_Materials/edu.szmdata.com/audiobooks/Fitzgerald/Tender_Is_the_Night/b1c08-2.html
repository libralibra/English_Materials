<p class="storyTitle">VIII</p>





<p>Violet breathed loud and hard once and with an effort brought
another expression into her face.</p>

<p>Dick came finally and with a sure instinct he separated Barban
and the McKiscos and became excessively ignorant and inquisitive
about literature with McKisco&#151;thus giving the latter the moment
of superiority which he required. The others helped him carry
lamps up&#151;who would not be pleased at carrying lamps helpfully
through the darkness? Rosemary helped, meanwhile responding
patiently to Royal Dumphry's inexhaustible curiosity about
Hollywood.</p>

<p>Now&#151;she was thinking&#151;I've earned a time alone with him. He
must know that because his laws are like the laws Mother taught
me.</p>

<p>Rosemary was right&#151;presently he detached her from the company
on the terrace, and they were alone together, borne away from the
house toward the seaside wall with what were less steps than
irregularly spaced intervals through some of which she was
pulled, through others blown.</p>

<p>They looked out over the Mediterranean. Far below, the last
excursion boat from the Isles des Lerins floated across the bay
like a Fourth-of-July balloon foot-loose in the heavens. Between
the black isles it floated, softly parting the dark tide.</p>

<p>"I understand why you speak as you do of your mother," he
said. "Her attitude toward you is very fine, I think. She has a
sort of wisdom that's rare in America."</p>

<p>"Mother is perfect," she prayed.</p>

<p>"I was talking to her about a plan I have&#151;she told me that
how long you both stayed in France depended on you."</p>

<p>On <i>you,</i> Rosemary all but said aloud.</p>

<p>"So since things are over down here&#151;"</p>

<p>"Over?" she inquired.</p>

<p>"Well, this is over&#151;this part of the summer is over. Last
week Nicole's sister left, to-morrow Tommy Barban leaves, Monday
Abe and Mary North are leaving. Maybe we'll have more fun this
summer but this particular fun is over. I want it to die
violently instead of fading out sentimentally&#151;that's why I gave
this party. What I'm coming to is&#151;Nicole and I are going up to
Paris to see Abe North off for America&#151;I wonder if you'd like to
go with us."</p>

<p>"What did Mother say?"</p>

<p>"She seemed to think it would be fine. She doesn't want to go
herself. She wants you to go alone."</p>

<p>"I haven't seen Paris since I've been grown," said Rosemary.
"I'd love to see it with you."</p>

<p>"That's nice of you." Did she imagine that his voice was
suddenly metallic? "Of course we've been excited about you from
the moment you came on the beach. That vitality, we were sure it
was professional&#151;especially Nicole was. It'd never use itself up
on any one person or group."</p>

<p>Her instinct cried out to her that he was passing her along
slowly toward Nicole and she put her own brakes on, saying with
an equal harness:</p>

<p>"I wanted to know all of you too&#151;especially you. I told you I
fell in love with you the first time I saw you."</p>

<p>She was right going at it that way. But the space between
heaven and earth had cooled his mind, destroyed the impulsiveness
that had led him to bring her here, and made him aware of the too
obvious appeal, the struggle with an unrehearsed scene and
unfamiliar words.</p>

<p>He tried now to make her want to go back to the house and it
was difficult, and he did not quite want to lose her. She felt
only the draft blowing as he joked with her good-humoredly.</p>

<p>"You don't know what you want. You go and ask your mother what
you want."</p>

<p>She was stricken. She touched him, feeling the smooth cloth of
his dark coat like a chasuble. She seemed about to fall to her
knees&#151;from that position she delivered her last shot.</p>

<p>"I think you're the most wonderful person I ever met&#151;except
my mother."</p>

<p>"You have romantic eyes."</p>

<p>His laughter swept them on up toward the terrace where he
delivered her to Nicole. . . .</p>

<p>Too soon it had become time to go and the Divers helped them
all to go quickly. In the Divers' big Isotta there would be Tommy
Barban and his baggage&#151;he was spending the night at the hotel to
catch an early train&#151;with Mrs. Abrams, the McKiscos and Campion.
Earl Brady was going to drop Rosemary and her mother on his way
to Monte Carlo, and Royal Dumphry rode with them because the
Divers' car was crowded. Down in the garden lanterns still glowed
over the table where they had dined, as the Divers stood side by
side in the gate, Nicole blooming away and filling the night with
graciousness, and Dick bidding good-by to everyone by name. To
Rosemary it seemed very poignant to drive away and leave them in
their house. Again she wondered what Mrs. McKisco had seen in the
bathroom.</p>
