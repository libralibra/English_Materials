<p>When he had tottered out, Dick and Rosemary embraced
fleetingly. There was a dust of Paris over both of them through
which they scented each other: the rubber guard on Dick's
fountain pen, the faintest odor of warmth from Rosemary's neck
and shoulders. For another half-minute Dick clung to the
situation; Rosemary was first to return to reality.</p>

<p>"I must go, youngster," she said.</p>

<p>They blinked at each other across a widening space, and
Rosemary made an exit that she had learned young, and on which no
director had ever tried to improve.</p>

<p>She opened the door of her room and went directly to her desk
where she had suddenly remembered leaving her wristwatch. It was
there; slipping it on she glanced down at the daily letter to her
mother, finishing the last sentence in her mind. Then, rather
gradually, she realized without turning about that she was not
alone in the room.</p>

<p>In an inhabited room there are refracting objects only half
noticed: varnished wood, more or less polished brass, silver and
ivory, and beyond these a thousand conveyers of light and shadow
so mild that one scarcely thinks of them as that, the tops of
picture-frames, the edges of pencils or ash-trays, of crystal or
china ornaments; the totality of this refraction&#151;appealing to
equally subtle reflexes of the vision as well as to those
associational fragments in the subconscious that we seem to hang
on to, as a glass-fitter keeps the irregularly shaped pieces that
may do some time&#151;this fact might account for what Rosemary
afterward mystically described as "realizing" that there was some
one in the room, before she could determine it. But when she did
realize it she turned swift in a sort of ballet step and saw that
a dead Negro was stretched upon her bed.</p>

<p>As she cried "aaouu!" and her still unfastened wristwatch
banged against the desk she had the preposterous idea that it was
Abe North. Then she dashed for the door and across the hall.</p>

<p>Dick was straightening up; he had examined the gloves worn
that day and thrown them into a pile of soiled gloves in a corner
of a trunk. He had hung up coat and vest and spread his shirt on
another hanger&#151;a trick of his own. "You'll wear a shirt that's a
little dirty where you won't wear a mussed shirt." Nicole had
come in and was dumping one of Abe's extraordinary ash-trays into
the waste-basket when Rosemary tore into the room.</p>

<p><i>"Dick! Dick!</i> Come and see!"</p>

<p>Dick jogged across the hall into her room. He knelt to
Peterson's heart, and felt the pulse&#151;the body was warm, the
face, harassed and indirect in life, was gross and bitter in
death; the box of materials was held under one arm but the shoe
that dangled over the bedside was bare of polish and its sole was
worn through. By French law Dick had no right to touch the body
but he moved the arm a little to see something&#151;there was a stain
on the green coverlet, there would be faint blood on the blanket
beneath.</p>

<p>Dick closed the door and stood thinking; he heard cautious
steps in the corridor and then Nicole calling him by name.
Opening the door he whispered: "Bring the couverture and top
blanket from one of our beds&#151;don't let any one see you." Then,
noticing the strained look on her face, he added quickly, "Look
here, you mustn't get upset over this&#151;it's only some nigger
scrap."</p>

<p>"I want it to be over."</p>

<p>The body, as Dick lifted it, was light and ill-nourished. He
held it so that further hemorrhages from the wound would flow
into the man's clothes. Laying it beside the bed he stripped off
the coverlet and top blanket and then opening the door an inch,
listened&#151;there was a clank of dishes down the hall followed by a
loud patronizing "Mer<i>ci</i>, Madame," but the waiter went in
the other direction, toward the service stairway. Quickly Dick
and Nicole exchanged bundles across the corridor; after spreading
this covering on Rosemary's bed, Dick stood sweating in the warm
twilight, considering. Certain points had become apparent to him
in the moment following his examination of the body; first, that
Abe's first hostile Indian had tracked the friendly Indian and
discovered him in the corridor, and when the latter had taken
desperate refuge in Rosemary's room, had hunted down and slain
him; second, that if the situation were allowed to develop
naturally, no power on earth could keep the smear off
Rosemary&#151;the paint was scarcely dry on the Arbuckle case. Her
contract was contingent upon an obligation to continue rigidly
and unexceptionally as "Daddy's Girl."</p>

<p>Automatically Dick made the old motion of turning up his
sleeves though he wore a sleeveless undershirt, and bent over the
body. Getting a purchase on the shoulders of the coat he kicked
open the door with his heel, and dragged the body quickly into a
plausible position in the corridor. He came back into Rosemary's
room and smoothed back the grain of the plush floor rug. Then he
went to the phone in his suite and called the manager-owner of
the hotel.</p>

<p>"McBeth?&#151;it's Doctor Diver speaking&#151;something very
important. Are we on a more or less private line?"</p>

<p>It was good that he had made the extra effort which had firmly
entrenched him with Mr. McBeth. Here was one use for all the
pleasingness that Dick had expended over a large area he would
never retrace. . . .</p>

<p>"Going out of the suite we came on a dead Negro . . . in the
hall . . . no, no, he's a civilian. Wait a minute now&#151;I knew you
didn't want any guests to blunder on the body so I'm phoning you.
Of course I must ask you to keep my name out of it. I don't want
any French red tape just because I discovered the man."</p>

<p>What exquisite consideration for the hotel! Only because Mr.
McBeth, with his own eyes, had seen these traits in Doctor Diver
two nights before, could he credit the story without
question.</p>

<p>In a minute Mr. McBeth arrived and in another minute he was
joined by a gendarme. In the interval he found time to whisper to
Dick, "You can be sure the name of any guest will be protected.
I'm only too grateful to you for your pains."</p>

<p>Mr. McBeth took an immediate step that may only be imagined,
but that influenced the gendarme so as to make him pull his
mustaches in a frenzy of uneasiness and greed. He made
perfunctory notes and sent a telephone call to his post.
Meanwhile with a celerity that Jules Peterson, as a business man,
would have quite understood, the remains were carried into
another apartment of one of the most fashionable hotels in the
world.</p>

<p>Dick went back to his salon.</p>

<p>"What <i>hap</i>pened?" cried Rosemary. "Do all the Americans
in Paris just shoot at each other all the time?"</p>

<p>"This seems to be the open season," he answered. "Where's
Nicole?"</p>

<p>"I think she's in the bathroom."</p>

<p>She adored him for saving her&#151;disasters that could have
attended upon the event had passed in prophecy through her mind;
and she had listened in wild worship to his strong, sure, polite
voice making it all right. But before she reached him in a sway
of soul and body his attention focussed on something else: he
went into the bedroom and toward the bathroom. And now Rosemary,
too, could hear, louder and louder, a verbal inhumanity that
penetrated the keyholes and the cracks in the doors, swept into
the suite and in the shape of horror took form again.</p>

<p>With the idea that Nicole had fallen in the bathroom and hurt
herself, Rosemary followed Dick. That was not the condition of
affairs at which she stared before Dick shouldered her back and
brusquely blocked her view.</p>

<p>Nicole knelt beside the tub swaying sidewise and sidewise.
"It's you!" she cried, "&#151;it's you come to intrude on the only
privacy I have in the world&#151;with your spread with red blood on
it. I'll wear it for you&#151;I'm not ashamed, though it was such a
pity. On All Fools Day we had a party on the Zurichsee, and all
the fools were there, and I wanted to come dressed in a spread
but they wouldn't let me&#151;"</p>

<p>"Control yourself!"</p>

<p>"&#151;so I sat in the bathroom and they brought me a domino and
said wear that. I did. What else could I do?"</p>

<p>"Control yourself, Nicole!"</p>

<p>"I never expected you to love me&#151;it was too late&#151;only don't
come in the bathroom, the only place I can go for privacy,
dragging spreads with red blood on them and asking me to fix
them."</p>

<p>"Control yourself. Get up&#151;"</p>

<p>Rosemary, back in the salon, heard the bathroom door bang, and
stood trembling: now she knew what Violet McKisco had seen in the
bathroom at Villa Diana. She answered the ringing phone and
almost cried with relief when she found it was Collis Clay, who
had traced her to the Divers' apartment. She asked him to come up
while she got her hat, because she was afraid to go into her room
alone.</p>
