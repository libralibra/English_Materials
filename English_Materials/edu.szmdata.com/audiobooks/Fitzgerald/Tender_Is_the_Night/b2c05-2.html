<p>The veranda of the central building was illuminated from open
French windows, save where the black shadows of stripling walls
and the fantastic shadows of iron chairs slithered down into a
gladiola bed. From the figures that shuffled between the rooms
Miss Warren emerged first in glimpses and then sharply when she
saw him; as she crossed the threshold her face caught the room's
last light and brought it outside with her. She walked to a
rhythm&#151;all that week there had been singing in her ears, summer
songs of ardent skies and wild shade, and with his arrival the
singing had become so loud she could have joined in with it.</p>

<p>"How do you do, Captain," she said, unfastening her eyes from
his with difficulty, as though they had become entangled. "Shall
we sit out here?" She stood still, her glance moving about for a
moment. "It's summer practically."</p>

<p>A woman had followed her out, a dumpy woman in a shawl, and
Nicole presented Dick: "Señora&#151;"</p>

<p>Franz excused himself and Dick grouped three chairs
together.</p>

<p>"The lovely night," the Señora said.</p>

<p>"Muy bella," agreed Nicole; then to Dick, "Are you here for a
long time?"</p>

<p>"I'm in Zurich for a long time, if that's what you mean."</p>

<p>"This is really the first night of real spring," the
Señora suggested.</p>

<p>"To stay?"</p>

<p>"At least till July."</p>

<p>"I'm leaving in June."</p>

<p>"June is a lovely month here," the Señora commented.
"You should stay for June and then leave in July when it gets
really too hot."</p>

<p>"You're going where?" Dick asked Nicole.</p>

<p>"Somewhere with my sister&#151;somewhere exciting, I hope, because
I've lost so much time. But perhaps they'll think I ought to go
to a quiet place at first&#151;perhaps Como. Why don't you come to
Como?"</p>

<p>"Ah, Como&#151;" began the Señora.</p>

<p>Within the building a trio broke into Suppe's "Light Cavalry."
Nicole took advantage of this to stand up and the impression of
her youth and beauty grew on Dick until it welled up inside him
in a compact paroxysm of emotion. She smiled, a moving childish
smile that was like all the lost youth in the world.</p>

<p>"The music's too loud to talk against&#151;suppose we walk around.
Buenas noches, Señora."</p>

<p>"G't night&#151;g't night."</p>

<p>They went down two steps to the path&#151;where in a moment a
shadow cut across it. She took his arm.</p>

<p>"I have some phonograph records my sister sent me from
America," she said. "Next time you come here I'll play them for
you&#151;I know a place to put the phonograph where no one can
hear."</p>

<p>"That'll be nice."</p>

<p>"Do you know 'Hindustan'?" she asked wistfully. "I'd never
heard it before, but I like it. And I've got 'Why Do They Call
Them Babies?' and 'I'm Glad I Can Make You Cry.' I suppose you've
danced to all those tunes in Paris?"</p>

<p>"I haven't been to Paris."</p>

<p>Her cream-colored dress, alternately blue or gray as they
walked, and her very blonde hair, dazzled Dick&#151;whenever he
turned toward her she was smiling a little, her face lighting up
like an angel's when they came into the range of a roadside arc.
She thanked him for everything, rather as if he had taken her to
some party, and as Dick became less and less certain of his
relation to her, her confidence increased&#151;there was that
excitement about her that seemed to reflect all the excitement of
the world.</p>

<p>"I'm not under any restraint at all," she said. "I'll play you
two good tunes called 'Wait Till the Cows Come Home' and
'Good-by, Alexander.'"</p>

<p>He was late the next time, a week later, and Nicole was
waiting for him at a point in the path which he would pass
walking from Franz's house. Her hair drawn back of her ears
brushed her shoulders in such a way that the face seemed to have
just emerged from it, as if this were the exact moment when she
was coming from a wood into clear moonlight. The unknown yielded
her up; Dick wished she had no background, that she was just a
girl lost with no address save the night from which she had come.
They went to the cache where she had left the phonograph, turned
a corner by the workshop, climbed a rock, and sat down behind a
low wall, facing miles and miles of rolling night.</p>

<p>They were in America now, even Franz with his conception of
Dick as an irresistible Lothario would never have guessed that
they had gone so far away. They were so sorry, dear; they went
down to meet each other in a taxi, honey; they had preferences in
smiles and had met in Hindustan, and shortly afterward they must
have quarrelled, for nobody knew and nobody seemed to care&#151;yet
finally one of them had gone and left the other crying, only to
feel blue, to feel sad.</p>

<p>The thin tunes, holding lost times and future hopes in
liaison, twisted upon the Valais night. In the lulls of the
phonograph a cricket held the scene together with a single note.
By and by Nicole stopped playing the machine and sang to him.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>"Lay a silver dollar<br>
 On the ground<br>
 And watch it roll<br>
 Because it's round&#151;"</p>
</blockquote>



<p>On the pure parting of her lips no breath hovered. Dick stood
up suddenly.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, you don't like it?"</p>

<p>"Of course I do."</p>

<p>"Our cook at home taught it to me:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>"A woman never knows<br>
 What a good man she's got<br>
 Till after she turns him down . . ."</p>
</blockquote>



<p>"You like it?"</p>

<p>She smiled at him, making sure that the smile gathered up
everything inside her and directed it toward him, making him a
profound promise of herself for so little, for the beat of a
response, the assurance of a complimentary vibration in him.
Minute by minute the sweetness drained down into her out of the
willow trees, out of the dark world.</p>

<p>She stood up too, and stumbling over the phonograph, was
momentarily against him, leaning into the hollow of his rounded
shoulder.</p>

<p>"I've got one more record," she said. "&#151;Have you heard 'So
Long, Letty'? I suppose you have."</p>

<p>"Honestly, you don't understand&#151;I haven't heard a thing."</p>

<p>Nor known, nor smelt, nor tasted, he might have added; only
hot-cheeked girls in hot secret rooms. The young maidens he had
known at New Haven in 1914 kissed men, saying "There!", hands at
the man's chest to push him away. Now there was this scarcely
saved waif of disaster bringing him the essence of a continent. .
