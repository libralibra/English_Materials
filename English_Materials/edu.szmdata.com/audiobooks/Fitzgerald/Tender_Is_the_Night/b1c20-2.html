<p>In the square, as they came out, a suspended mass of gasoline
exhaust cooked slowly in the July sun. It was a terrible
thing&#151;unlike pure heat it held no promise of rural escape but
suggested only roads choked with the same foul asthma. During
their luncheon, outdoors, across from the Luxembourg Gardens,
Rosemary had cramps and felt fretful and full of impatient
lassitude&#151;it was the foretaste of this that had inspired her
self-accusation of selfishness in the station.</p>

<p>Dick had no suspicion of the sharpness of the change; he was
profoundly unhappy and the subsequent increase of egotism tended
momentarily to blind him to what was going on round about him,
and deprive him of the long ground-swell of imagination that he
counted on for his judgments.</p>

<p>After Mary North left them, accompanied by the Italian singing
teacher who had joined them for coffee and was taking her to her
train, Rosemary, too, stood up, bound for an engagement at her
studio: "meet some officials."</p>

<p>"And oh&#151;" she proposed "&#151;if Collis Clay, that Southern
boy&#151;if he comes while you are still sitting here, just tell him
I couldn't wait; tell him to call me to-morrow."</p>

<p>Too insouciant, in reaction from the late disturbance, she had
assumed the privileges of a child&#151;the result being to remind the
Divers of their exclusive love for their own children; Rosemary
was sharply rebuked in a short passage between the women: "You'd
better leave the message with a waiter," Nicole's voice was stern
and unmodulated, "we're leaving immediately."</p>

<p>Rosemary got it, took it without resentment.</p>

<p>"I'll let it go then. Good-by, you darlings."</p>

<p>Dick asked for the check; the Divers relaxed, chewing
tentatively on toothpicks.</p>

<p>"Well&#151;" they said together.</p>

<p>He saw a flash of unhappiness on her mouth, so brief that only
he would have noticed, and he could pretend not to have seen.
What did Nicole think? Rosemary was one of a dozen people he had
"worked over" in the past years: these had included a French
circus clown, Abe and Mary North, a pair of dancers, a writer, a
painter, a comedienne from the Grand Guignol, a half-crazy
pederast from the Russian Ballet, a promising tenor they had
staked to a year in Milan. Nicole well knew how seriously these
people interpreted his interest and enthusiasm; but she realized
also that, except while their children were being born, Dick had
not spent a night apart from her since their marriage. On the
other hand, there was a pleasingness about him that simply had to
be used&#151;those who possessed that pleasingness had to keep their
hands in, and go along attaching people that they had no use to
make of.</p>

<p>Now Dick hardened himself and let minutes pass without making
any gesture of confidence, any representation of constantly
renewed surprise that they were one together.</p>

<p>Collis Clay out of the South edged a passage between the
closely packed tables and greeted the Divers cavalierly. Such
salutations always astonished Dick&#151;acquaintances saying "Hi!" to
them, or speaking only to one of them. He felt so intensely about
people that in moments of apathy he preferred to remain
concealed; that one could parade a casualness into his presence
was a challenge to the key on which he lived.</p>

<p>Collis, unaware that he was without a wedding garment,
heralded his arrival with: "I reckon I'm late&#151;the beyed has
flown." Dick had to wrench something out of himself before he
could forgive him for not having first complimented Nicole.</p>

<p>She left almost immediately and he sat with Collis, finishing
the last of his wine. He rather liked Collis&#151;he was "post-war";
less difficult than most of the Southerners he had known at New
Haven a decade previously. Dick listened with amusement to the
conversation that accompanied the slow, profound stuffing of a
pipe. In the early afternoon children and nurses were trekking
into the Luxembourg Gardens; it was the first time in months that
Dick had let this part of the day out of his hands.</p>

<p>Suddenly his blood ran cold as he realized the content of
Collis's confidential monologue.</p>

<p>"&#151;she's not so cold as you'd probably think. I admit I
thought she was cold for a long time. But she got into a jam with
a friend of mine going from New York to Chicago at Easter&#151;a boy
named Hillis she thought was pretty nutsey at New Haven&#151;she had
a compartment with a cousin of mine but she and Hillis wanted to
be alone, so in the afternoon my cousin came and played cards in
our compartment. Well, after about two hours we went back and
there was Rosemary and Bill Hillis standing in the vestibule
arguing with the conductor&#151;Rosemary white as a sheet. Seems they
locked the door and pulled down the blinds and I guess there was
some heavy stuff going on when the conductor came for the tickets
and knocked on the door. They thought it was us kidding them and
wouldn't let him in at first, and when they did, he was plenty
sore. He asked Hillis if that was his compartment and whether he
and Rosemary were married that they locked the door, and Hillis
lost his temper trying to explain there was nothing wrong. He
said the conductor had insulted Rosemary and he wanted him to
fight, but that conductor could have made trouble&#151;and believe me
I had an awful time smoothing it over."</p>

<p>With every detail imagined, with even envy for the pair's
community of misfortune in the vestibule, Dick felt a change
taking place within him. Only the image of a third person, even a
vanished one, entering into his relation with Rosemary was needed
to throw him off his balance and send through him waves of pain,
misery, desire, desperation. The vividly pictured hand on
Rosemary's cheek, the quicker breath, the white excitement of the
event viewed from outside, the inviolable secret warmth
within.</p>

<p>&#151;Do you mind if I pull down the curtain?</p>

<p>&#151;Please do. It's too light in here.</p>

<p>Collis Clay was now speaking about fraternity politics at New
Haven, in the same tone, with the same emphasis. Dick had
gathered that he was in love with Rosemary in some curious way
Dick could not have understood. The affair with Hillis seemed to
have made no emotional impression on Collis save to give him the
joyful conviction that Rosemary was "human."</p>

<p>"Bones got a wonderful crowd," he said. "We all did, as a
matter of fact. New Haven's so big now the sad thing is the men
we have to leave out."</p>

<p>&#151;Do you mind if I pull down the curtain?</p>

<p>&#151;Please do. It's too light in here.</p>

<p>. . . Dick went over Paris to his bank&#151;writing a check, he
looked along the row of men at the desks deciding to which one he
would present it for an O.K. As he wrote he engrossed himself in
the material act, examining meticulously the pen, writing
laboriously upon the high glass-topped desk. Once he raised
glazed eyes to look toward the mail department, then glazed his
spirit again by concentration upon the objects he dealt with.</p>

<p>Still he failed to decide to whom the check should be
presented, which man in the line would guess least of the unhappy
predicament in which he found himself and, also, which one would
be least likely to talk. There was Perrin, the suave New Yorker,
who had asked him to luncheons at the American Club, there was
Casasus, the Spaniard, with whom he usually discussed a mutual
friend in spite of the fact that the friend had passed out of his
life a dozen years before; there was Muchhause, who always asked
him whether he wanted to draw upon his wife's money or his
own.</p>

<p>As he entered the amount on the stub, and drew two lines under
it, he decided to go to Pierce, who was young and for whom he
would have to put on only a small show. It was often easier to
give a show than to watch one.</p>

<p>He went to the mail desk first&#151;as the woman who served him
pushed up with her bosom a piece of paper that had nearly escaped
the desk, he thought how differently women use their bodies from
men. He took his letters aside to open: There was a bill for
seventeen psychiatric books from a German concern, a bill from
Brentano's, a letter from Buffalo from his father, in a
handwriting that year by year became more indecipherable; there
was a card from Tommy Barban postmarked Fez and bearing a
facetious communication; there were letters from doctors in
Zurich, both in German; a disputed bill from a plasterer in
Cannes; a bill from a furniture maker; a letter from the
publisher of a medical journal in Baltimore, miscellaneous
announcements and an invitation to a showing of pictures by an
incipient artist; also there were three letters for Nicole, and a
letter for Rosemary sent in his care.</p>

<p>&#151;Do you mind if I pull down the curtain?</p>

<p>He went toward Pierce but he was engaged with a woman, and
Dick saw with his heels that he would have to present his check
to Casasus at the next desk, who was free.</p>

<p>"How are you, Diver?" Casasus was genial. He stood up, his
mustache spreading with his smile. "We were talking about
Featherstone the other day and I thought of you&#151;he's out in
California now."</p>

<p>Dick widened his eyes and bent forward a little.</p>

<p>"In Cali<i>for</i>nia?"</p>

<p>"That's what I heard."</p>

<p>Dick held the check poised; to focus the attention of Casasus
upon it he looked toward Pierce's desk, holding the latter for a
moment in a friendly eye-play conditioned by an old joke of three
years before when Pierce had been involved with a Lithuanian
countess. Pierce played up with a grin until Casasus had
authorized the check and had no further recourse to detain Dick,
whom he liked, than to stand up holding his pince-nez and repeat,
"Yes, he's in California."</p>

<p>Meanwhile Dick had seen that Perrin, at the head of the line
of desks, was in conversation with the heavyweight champion of
the world; from a sidesweep of Perrin's eye Dick saw that he was
considering calling him over and introducing him, but that he
finally decided against it.</p>

<p>Cutting across the social mood of Casasus with the intensity
he had accumulated at the glass desk&#151;which is to say he looked
hard at the check, studying it, and then fixed his eyes on grave
problems beyond the first marble pillar to the right of the
banker's head and made a business of shifting the cane, hat, and
letters he carried&#151;he said good-by and went out. He had long ago
purchased the doorman; his taxi sprang to the curb.</p>

<p>"I want to go to the Films Par Excellence Studio&#151;it's on a
little street in Passy. Go to the Muette. I'll direct you from
there."</p>

<p>He was rendered so uncertain by the events of the last
forty-eight hours that he was not even sure of what he wanted to
do; he paid off the taxi at the Muette and walked in the
direction of the studio, crossing to the opposite side of the
street before he came to the building. Dignified in his fine
clothes, with their fine accessories, he was yet swayed and
driven as an animal. Dignity could come only with an overthrowing
of his past, of the effort of the last six years. He went briskly
around the block with the fatuousness of one of Tarkington's
adolescents, hurrying at the blind places lest he miss Rosemary's
coming out of the studio. It was a melancholy neighborhood. Next
door to the place he saw a sign: "1000 chemises." The shirts
filled the window, piled, cravated, stuffed, or draped with
shoddy grace on the showcase floor: "1000 chemises"&#151;count them!
On either side he read: "Papeterie," "Pâtisserie," "Solde,"
"Réclame"&#151;and Constance Talmadge in "Déjeuner de
Soleil," and farther away there were more sombre announcements:
"Vêtements Ecclésiastiques," "Déclaration de
Décès" and "Pompes Funèbres." Life and
death.</p>

<p>He knew that what he was now doing marked a turning point in
his life&#151;it was out of line with everything that had preceded
it&#151;even out of line with what effect he might hope to produce
upon Rosemary. Rosemary saw him always as a model of
correctness&#151;his presence walking around this block was an
intrusion. But Dick's necessity of behaving as he did was a
projection of some submerged reality: he was compelled to walk
there, or stand there, his shirt-sleeve fitting his wrist and his
coat sleeve encasing his shirt-sleeve like a sleeve valve, his
collar molded plastically to his neck, his red hair cut exactly,
his hand holding his small briefcase like a dandy&#151;just as
another man once found it necessary to stand in front of a church
in Ferrara, in sackcloth and ashes. Dick was paying some tribute
to things unforgotten, unshriven, unexpurgated.</p>
