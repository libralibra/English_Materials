<p class="storyTitle">VI</p>





<p>It was May when he next found her. The luncheon in Zurich was
a council of caution; obviously the logic of his life tended away
from the girl; yet when a stranger stared at her from a nearby
table, eyes burning disturbingly like an uncharted light, he
turned to the man with an urbane version of intimidation and
broke the regard.</p>

<p>"He was just a peeper," he explained cheerfully. "He was just
looking at your clothes. Why do you have so many different
clothes?"</p>

<p>"Sister says we're very rich," she offered humbly. "Since
Grandmother is dead."</p>

<p>"I forgive you."</p>

<p>He was enough older than Nicole to take pleasure in her
youthful vanities and delights, the way she paused fractionally
in front of the hall mirror on leaving the restaurant, so that
the incorruptible quicksilver could give her back to herself. He
delighted in her stretching out her hands to new octaves now that
she found herself beautiful and rich. He tried honestly to
divorce her from any obsession that he had stitched her
together&#151;glad to see her build up happiness and confidence apart
from him; the difficulty was that, eventually, Nicole brought
everything to his feet, gifts of sacrificial ambrosia, of
worshipping myrtle.</p>

<p>The first week of summer found Dick re-established in Zurich.
He had arranged his pamphlets and what work he had done in the
Service into a pattern from which he intended to make his revise
of "A Psychology for Psychiatrists." He thought he had a
publisher; he had established contact with a poor student who
would iron out his errors in German. Franz considered it a rash
business, but Dick pointed out the disarming modesty of the
theme.</p>

<p>"This is stuff I'll never know so well again," he insisted. "I
have a hunch it's a thing that only fails to be basic because
it's never had material recognition. The weakness of this
profession is its attraction for the man a little crippled and
broken. Within the walls of the profession he compensates by
tending toward the clinical, the 'practical'&#151;he has won his
battle without a struggle.</p>

<p>"On the contrary, you are a good man, Franz, because fate
selected you for your profession before you were born. You better
thank God you had no 'bent'&#151;I got to be a psychiatrist because
there was a girl at St. Hilda's in Oxford that went to the same
lectures. Maybe I'm getting trite but I don't want to let my
current ideas slide away with a few dozen glasses of beer."</p>

<p>"All right," Franz answered. "You are an American. You can do
this without professional harm. I do not like these generalities.
Soon you will be writing little books called 'Deep Thoughts for
the Layman,' so simplified that they are positively guaranteed
not to cause thinking. If my father were alive he would look at
you and grunt, Dick. He would take his napkin and fold it so, and
hold his napkin ring, this very one&#151;" he held it up, a boar's
head was carved in the brown wood&#151;"and he would say, 'Well my
impression is&#151;' then he would look at you and think suddenly
'What is the use?' then he would stop and grunt again; then we
would be at the end of dinner."</p>

<p>"I am alone to-day," said Dick testily. "But I may not be
alone to-morrow. After that I'll fold up my napkin like your
father and grunt."</p>

<p>Franz waited a moment.</p>

<p>"How about our patient?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I don't know."</p>

<p>"Well, you should know about her by now."</p>

<p>"I like her. She's attractive. What do you want me to do&#151;take
her up in the edelweiss?"</p>

<p>"No, I thought since you go in for scientific books you might
have an idea."</p>

<p>"&#151;devote my life to her?"</p>

<p>Franz called his wife in the kitchen: "Du lieber Gott! Bitte,
bringe Dick noch ein Glas-Bier."</p>

<p>"I don't want any more if I've got to see Dohmler."</p>

<p>"We think it's best to have a program. Four weeks have passed
away&#151;apparently the girl is in love with you. That's not our
business if we were in the world, but here in the clinic we have
a stake in the matter."</p>

<p>"I'll do whatever Doctor Dohmler says," Dick agreed.</p>

<p>But he had little faith that Dohmler would throw much light on
the matter; he himself was the incalculable element involved. By
no conscious volition of his own, the thing had drifted into his
hands. It reminded him of a scene in his childhood when everyone
in the house was looking for the lost key to the silver closet,
Dick knowing he had hid it under the handkerchiefs in his
mother's top drawer; at that time he had experienced a
philosophical detachment, and this was repeated now when he and
Franz went together to Professor Dohmler's office.</p>

<p>The professor, his face beautiful under straight whiskers,
like a vine-overgrown veranda of some fine old house, disarmed
him. Dick knew some individuals with more talent, but no person
of a class qualitatively superior to Dohmler.</p>

<p>&#151;Six months later he thought the same way when he saw Dohmler
dead, the light out on the veranda, the vines of his whiskers
tickling his stiff white collar, the many battles that had swayed
before the chink-like eyes stilled forever under the frail
delicate lids&#151;</p>

<p>". . . Good morning, sir." He stood formally, thrown back to
the army.</p>

<p>Professor Dohmler interlaced his tranquil fingers. Franz spoke
in terms half of liaison officer, half of secretary, till his
senior cut through him in mid-sentence.</p>

<p>"We have gone a certain way," he said mildly. "It's you,
Doctor Diver, who can best help us now."</p>

<p>Routed out, Dick confessed: "I'm not so straight on it
myself."</p>

<p>"I have nothing to do with your personal reactions," said
Dohmler. "But I have much to do with the fact that this so-called
'transference,'" he darted a short ironic look at Franz which the
latter returned in kind, "must be terminated. Miss Nicole does
well indeed, but she is in no condition to survive what she might
interpret as a tragedy."</p>

<p>Again Franz began to speak, but Doctor Dohmler motioned him
silent.</p>

<p>"I realize that your position has been difficult."</p>

<p>"Yes, it has."</p>

<p>Now the professor sat back and laughed, saying on the last
syllable of his laughter, with his sharp little gray eyes shining
through: "Perhaps you have got sentimentally involved
yourself."</p>

<p>Aware that he was being drawn on, Dick, too, laughed.</p>

<p>"She's a pretty girl&#151;anybody responds to that to a certain
extent. I have no intention&#151;"</p>

<p>Again Franz tried to speak&#151;again Dohmler stopped him with a
question directed pointedly at Dick. "Have you thought of going
away?"</p>

<p>"I can't go away."</p>

<p>Doctor Dohmler turned to Franz: "Then we can send Miss Warren
away."</p>

<p>"As you think best, Professor Dohmler," Dick conceded. "It's
certainly a situation."</p>

<p>Professor Dohmler raised himself like a legless man mounting a
pair of crutches.</p>

<p>"But it is a professional situation," he cried quietly.</p>

<p>He sighed himself back into his chair, waiting for the
reverberating thunder to die out about the room. Dick saw that
Dohmler had reached his climax, and he was not sure that he
himself had survived it. When the thunder had diminished Franz
managed to get his word in.</p>

<p>"Doctor Diver is a man of fine character," he said. "I feel he
only has to appreciate the situation in order to deal correctly
with it. In my opinion Dick can co-operate right here, without
any one going away."</p>

<p>"How do you feel about that?" Professor Dohmler asked
Dick.</p>

<p>Dick felt churlish in the face of the situation; at the same
time he realized in the silence after Dohmler's pronouncement
that the state of inanimation could not be indefinitely
prolonged; suddenly he spilled everything.</p>

<p>"I'm half in love with her&#151;the question of marrying her has
passed through my mind."</p>

<p>"Tch! Tch!" uttered Franz.</p>

<p>"Wait." Dohmler warned him. Franz refused to wait: "What! And
devote half your life to being doctor and nurse and all&#151;never! I
know what these cases are. One time in twenty it's finished in
the first push&#151;better never see her again!"</p>

<p>"What do you think?" Dohmler asked Dick.</p>

<p>"Of course Franz is right."</p>
