<p>"I want to go away," he told Franz. "For a month or so, for as
long as I can."</p>

<p>"Why not, Dick? That was our original arrangement&#151;it was you
who insisted on staying. If you and Nicole&#151;"</p>

<p>"I don't want to go away with Nicole. I want to go away alone.
This last thing knocked me sideways&#151;if I get two hours' sleep in
twenty-four, it's one of Zwingli's miracles."</p>

<p>"You wish a real leave of abstinence."</p>

<p>"The word is 'absence.' Look here: if I go to Berlin to the
Psychiatric Congress could you manage to keep the peace? For
three months she's been all right and she likes her nurse. My
God, you're the only human being in this world I can ask this
of."</p>

<p>Franz grunted, considering whether or not he could be trusted
to think always of his partner's interest.</p>





<p>In Zurich the next week Dick drove to the airport and took the
big plane for Munich. Soaring and roaring into the blue he felt
numb, realizing how tired he was. A vast persuasive quiet stole
over him, and he abandoned sickness to the sick, sound to the
motors, direction to the pilot. He had no intention of attending
so much as a single session of the congress&#151;he could imagine it
well enough, new pamphlets by Bleuler and the elder Forel that he
could much better digest at home, the paper by the American who
cured dementia præcox by pulling out his patient's teeth or
cauterizing their tonsils, the half-derisive respect with which
this idea would be greeted, for no more reason than that America
was such a rich and powerful country. The other delegates from
America&#151;red-headed Schwartz with his saint's face and his
infinite patience in straddling two worlds, as well as dozens of
commercial alienists with hang-dog faces, who would be present
partly to increase their standing, and hence their reach for the
big plums of the criminal practice, partly to master novel
sophistries that they could weave into their stock in trade, to
the infinite confusion of all values. There would be cynical
Latins, and some man of Freud's from Vienna. Articulate among
them would be the great Jung, bland, super-vigorous, on his
rounds between the forests of anthropology and the neuroses of
school-boys. At first there would be an American cast to the
congress, almost Rotarian in its forms and ceremonies, then the
closer-knit European vitality would fight through, and finally
the Americans would play their trump card, the announcement of
colossal gifts and endowments, of great new plants and training
schools, and in the presence of the figures the Europeans would
blanch and walk timidly. But he would not be there to see.</p>

<p>They skirted the Vorarlberg Alps, and Dick felt a pastoral
delight in watching the villages. There were always four or five
in sight, each one gathered around a church. It was simple
looking at the earth from far off, simple as playing grim games
with dolls and soldiers. This was the way statesmen and
commanders and all retired people looked at things. Anyhow, it
was a good draft of relief.</p>

<p>An Englishman spoke to him from across the aisle but he found
something antipathetic in the English lately. England was like a
rich man after a disastrous orgy who makes up to the household by
chatting with them individually, when it is obvious to them that
he is only trying to get back his self-respect in order to usurp
his former power.</p>

<p>Dick had with him what magazines were available on the station
quays: The Century, The Motion Picture, L'lllustration, and the
Fliegende Blätter, but it was more fun to descend in his
imagination into the villages and shake hands with the rural
characters. He sat in the churches as he sat in his father's
church in Buffalo, amid the starchy must of Sunday clothes. He
listened to the wisdom of the Near East, was Crucified, Died, and
was Buried in the cheerful church, and once more worried between
five or ten cents for the collection plate, because of the girl
who sat in the pew behind.</p>

<p>The Englishman suddenly borrowed his magazines with a little
small change of conversation, and Dick, glad to see them go,
thought of the voyage ahead of him. Wolf-like under his sheep's
clothing of long-staple Australian wool, he considered the world
of pleasure&#151;the incorruptible Mediterranean with sweet old dirt
caked in the olive trees, the peasant girl near Savona with a
face as green and rose as the color of an illuminated missal. He
would take her in his hands and snatch her across the border . .
.</p>

<p>. . . but there he deserted her&#151;he must press on toward the
Isles of Greece, the cloudy waters of unfamiliar ports, the lost
girl on shore, the moon of popular songs. A part of Dick's mind
was made up of the tawdry souvenirs of his boyhood. Yet in that
somewhat littered Five-and-Ten, he had managed to keep alive the
low painful fire of intelligence.</p>
