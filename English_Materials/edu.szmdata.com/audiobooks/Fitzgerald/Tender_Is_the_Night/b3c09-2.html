<p class="storyTitle">IX</p>





<p>At four o'clock next afternoon a station taxi stopped at the
gate and Dick got out. Suddenly off balance, Nicole ran from the
terrace to meet him, breathless with her effort at
self-control.</p>

<p>"Where's the car?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I left it in Arles. I didn't feel like driving any more."</p>

<p>"I thought from your note that you'd be several days."</p>

<p>"I ran into a mistral and some rain."</p>

<p>"Did you have fun?"</p>

<p>"Just as much fun as anybody has running away from things. I
drove Rosemary as far as Avignon and put her on her train there."
They walked toward the terrace together, where he deposited his
bag. "I didn't tell you in the note because I thought you'd
imagine a lot of things."</p>

<p>"That was very considerate of you." Nicole felt surer of
herself now.</p>

<p>"I wanted to find out if she had anything to offer&#151;the only
way was to see her alone."</p>

<p>"Did she have&#151;anything to offer?"</p>

<p>"Rosemary didn't grow up," he answered. "It's probably better
that way. What have you been doing?"</p>

<p>She felt her face quiver like a rabbit's.</p>

<p>"I went dancing last night&#151;with Tommy Barban. We went&#151;"</p>

<p>He winced, interrupting her.</p>

<p>"Don't tell me about it. It doesn't matter what you do, only I
don't want to know anything definitely."</p>

<p>"There isn't anything to know."</p>

<p>"All right, all right." Then as if he had been away a week:
"How are the children?"</p>

<p>The phone rang in the house.</p>

<p>"If it's for me I'm not home," said Dick turning away quickly.
"I've got some things to do over in the work-room."</p>

<p>Nicole waited till he was out of sight behind the well; then
she went into the house and took up the phone.</p>

<p>"Nicole, comment vas-tu?"</p>

<p>"Dick's home."</p>

<p>He groaned.</p>

<p>"Meet me here in Cannes," he suggested. "I've got to talk to
you."</p>

<p>"I can't."</p>

<p>"Tell me you love me." Without speaking she nodded at the
receiver; he repeated, "Tell me you love me."</p>

<p>"Oh, I do," she assured him. "But there's nothing to be done
right now."</p>

<p>"Of course there is," he said impatiently. "Dick sees it's
over between you two&#151;it's obvious he has quit. What does he
expect you to do?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. I'll have to&#151;" She stopped herself from saying
"&#151;to wait until I can ask Dick," and instead finished with:
"I'll write and I'll phone you to-morrow."</p>

<p>She wandered about the house rather contentedly, resting on
her achievement. She was a mischief, and that was a satisfaction;
no longer was she a huntress of corralled game. Yesterday came
back to her now in innumerable detail&#151;detail that began to
overlay her memory of similar moments when her love for Dick was
fresh and intact. She began to slight that love, so that it
seemed to have been tinged with sentimental habit from the first.
With the opportunistic memory of women she scarcely recalled how
she had felt when she and Dick had possessed each other in secret
places around the corners of the world, during the month before
they were married. Just so had she lied to Tommy last night,
swearing to him that never before had she so entirely, so
completely, so utterly. . . .</p>

<p>. . . then remorse for this moment of betrayal, which so
cavalierly belittled a decade of her life, turned her walk toward
Dick's sanctuary.</p>

<p>Approaching noiselessly she saw him behind his cottage,
sitting in a steamer chair by the cliff wall, and for a moment
she regarded him silently. He was thinking, he was living a world
completely his own and in the small motions of his face, the brow
raised or lowered, the eyes narrowed or widened, the lips set and
reset, the play of his hands, she saw him progress from phase to
phase of his own story spinning out inside him, his own, not
hers. Once he clenched his fists and leaned forward, once it
brought into his face an expression of torment and despair&#151;when
this passed its stamp lingered in his eyes. For almost the first
time in her life she was sorry for him&#151;it is hard for those who
have once been mentally afflicted to be sorry for those who are
well, and though Nicole often paid lip service to the fact that
he had led her back to the world she had forfeited, she had
thought of him really as an inexhaustible energy, incapable of
fatigue&#151;she forgot the troubles she caused him at the moment
when she forgot the troubles of her own that had prompted her.
That he no longer controlled her&#151;did he know that? Had he willed
it all?&#151;she felt as sorry for him as she had sometimes felt for
Abe North and his ignoble destiny, sorry as for the helplessness
of infants and the old.</p>

<p>She went up putting her arm around his shoulder and touching
their heads together said:</p>

<p>"Don't be sad."</p>

<p>He looked at her coldly.</p>

<p>"Don't touch me!" he said.</p>

<p>Confused she moved a few feet away.</p>

<p>"Excuse me," he continued abstractedly. "I was just thinking
what I thought of you&#151;"</p>

<p>"Why not add the new classification to your book?"</p>

<p>"I have thought of it&#151;'Furthermore and beyond the psychoses
and the neuroses&#151;'"</p>

<p>"I didn't come over here to be disagreeable."</p>

<p>"Then why <i>did</i> you come, Nicole? I can't do anything for
you any more. I'm trying to save myself."</p>

<p>"From my contamination?"</p>

<p>"Profession throws me in contact with questionable company
sometimes."</p>

<p>She wept with anger at the abuse.</p>

<p>"You're a coward! You've made a failure of your life, and you
want to blame it on me."</p>

<p>While he did not answer she began to feel the old hypnotism of
his intelligence, sometimes exercised without power but always
with substrata of truth under truth which she could not break or
even crack. Again she struggled with it, fighting him with her
small, fine eyes, with the plush arrogance of a top dog, with her
nascent transference to another man, with the accumulated
resentment of years; she fought him with her money and her faith
that her sister disliked him and was behind her now; with the
thought of the new enemies he was making with his bitterness,
with her quick guile against his wine-ing and dine-ing slowness,
her health and beauty against his physical deterioration, her
unscrupulousness against his moralities&#151;for this inner battle
she used even her weaknesses&#151;fighting bravely and courageously
with the old cans and crockery and bottles, empty receptacles of
her expiated sins, outrages, mistakes. And suddenly, in the space
of two minutes she achieved her victory and justified herself to
herself without lie or subterfuge, cut the cord forever. Then she
walked, weak in the legs, and sobbing coolly, toward the
household that was hers at last.</p>

<p>Dick waited until she was out of sight. Then he leaned his
head forward on the parapet. The case was finished. Doctor Diver
was at liberty.</p>
