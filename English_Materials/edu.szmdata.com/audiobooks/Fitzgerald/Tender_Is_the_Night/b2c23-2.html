<p class="storyTitle">XXIII</p>





<p>Until one o'clock Baby Warren lay in bed, reading one of
Marion Crawford's curiously inanimate Roman stories; then she
went to a window and looked down into the street. Across from the
hotel two carabinieri, grotesque in swaddling capes and harlequin
hats, swung voluminously from this side and that, like mains'ls
coming about, and watching them she thought of the guards'
officer who had stared at her so intensely at lunch. He had
possessed the arrogance of a tall member of a short race, with no
obligation save to be tall. Had he come up to her and said:
"Let's go along, you and I," she would have answered: "Why
not?"&#151;at least it seemed so now, for she was still disembodied
by an unfamiliar background.</p>

<p>Her thoughts drifted back slowly through the guardsman to the
two carabinieri, to Dick&#151;she got into bed and turned out the
light.</p>

<p>A little before four she was awakened by a brusque
knocking.</p>

<p>"Yes&#151;what is it?"</p>

<p>"It's the concierge, Madame."</p>

<p>She pulled on her kimono and faced him sleepily.</p>

<p>"Your friend name Deever he's in trouble. He had trouble with
the police, and they have him in the jail. He sent a taxi up to
tell, the driver says that he promised him two hundred lire." He
paused cautiously for this to be approved. "The driver says Mr.
Deever in the bad trouble. He had a fight with the police and is
terribly bad hurt."</p>

<p>"I'll be right down."</p>

<p>She dressed to an accompaniment of anxious heartbeats and ten
minutes later stepped out of the elevator into the dark lobby.
The chauffeur who brought the message was gone; the concierge
hailed another one and told him the location of the jail. As they
rode, the darkness lifted and thinned outside and Baby's nerves,
scarcely awake, cringed faintly at the unstable balance between
night and day. She began to race against the day; sometimes on
the broad avenues she gained but whenever the thing that was
pushing up paused for a moment, gusts of wind blew here and there
impatiently and the slow creep of light began once more. The cab
went past a loud fountain splashing in a voluminous shadow,
turned into an alley so curved that the buildings were warped and
strained following it, bumped and rattled over cobblestones, and
stopped with a jerk where two sentry boxes were bright against a
wall of green damp. Suddenly from the violet darkness of an
archway came Dick's voice, shouting and screaming.</p>

<p>"Are there any English? Are there any Americans? Are there any
English? Are there any&#151;oh, my God! You dirty Wops!"</p>

<p>His voice died away and she heard a dull sound of beating on
the door. Then the voice began again.</p>

<p>"Are there any Americans? Are there any English?"</p>

<p>Following the voice she ran through the arch into a court,
whirled about in momentary confusion and located the small
guard-room whence the cries came. Two carabinieri started to
their feet, but Baby brushed past them to the door of the
cell.</p>

<p>"Dick!" she called. "What's the trouble?"</p>

<p>"They've put out my eye," he cried. "They handcuffed me and
then they beat me, the goddamn&#151;the&#151;"</p>

<p>Flashing around Baby took a step toward the two
carabinieri.</p>

<p>"What have you done to him?" she whispered so fiercely that
they flinched before her gathering fury.</p>

<p>"Non capisco inglese."</p>

<p>In French she execrated them; her wild, confident rage filled
the room, enveloped them until they shrank and wriggled from the
garments of blame with which she invested them. "Do something! Do
something!"</p>

<p>"We can do nothing until we are ordered."</p>

<p>"Bene. <i>Bay-nay! Bene!"</i></p>

<p>Once more Baby let her passion scorch around them until they
sweated out apologies for their impotence, looking at each other
with the sense that something had after all gone terribly wrong.
Baby went to the cell door, leaned against it, almost caressing
it, as if that could make Dick feel her presence and power, and
cried: "I'm going to the Embassy, I'll be back." Throwing a last
glance of infinite menace at the carabinieri she ran out.</p>

<p>She drove to the American Embassy where she paid off the
taxi-driver upon his insistence. It was still dark when she ran
up the steps and pressed the bell. She had pressed it three times
before a sleepy English porter opened the door to her.</p>

<p>"I want to see some one," she said. "Any one&#151;but right
away."</p>

<p>"No one's awake, Madame. We don't open until nine
o'clock."</p>

<p>Impatiently she waved the hour away.</p>

<p>"This is important. A man&#151;an American has been terribly
beaten. He's in an Italian jail."</p>

<p>"No one's awake now. At nine o'clock&#151;"</p>

<p>"I can't wait. They've put out a man's eye&#151;my brother-in-law,
and they won't let him out of jail. I must talk to some
one&#151;can't you see? Are you crazy? Are you an idiot, you stand
there with that look in your face?"</p>

<p>"Hime unable to do anything, Madame."</p>

<p>"You've got to wake some one up!" She seized him by the
shoulders and jerked him violently. "It's a matter of life and
death. If you won't wake some one a terrible thing will happen to
you&#151;"</p>

<p>"Kindly don't lay hands on me, Madame."</p>

<p>From above and behind the porter floated down a weary Groton
voice.</p>

<p>"What is it there?"</p>

<p>The porter answered with relief.</p>

<p>"It's a lady, sir, and she has shook me." He had stepped back
to speak and Baby pushed forward into the hall. On an upper
landing, just aroused from sleep and wrapped in a white
embroidered Persian robe, stood a singular young man. His face
was of a monstrous and unnatural pink, vivid yet dead, and over
his mouth was fastened what appeared to be a gag. When he saw
Baby he moved his head back into a shadow.</p>

<p>"What is it?" he repeated.</p>

<p>Baby told him, in her agitation edging forward to the stairs.
In the course of her story she realized that the gag was in
reality a mustache bandage and that the man's face was covered
with pink cold cream, but the fact fitted quietly into the
nightmare. The thing to do, she cried passionately, was for him
to come to the jail with her at once and get Dick out.</p>

<p>"It's a bad business," he said.</p>

<p>"Yes," she agreed conciliatingly. "Yes?"</p>

<p>"This trying to fight the police." A note of personal affront
crept into his voice, "I'm afraid there's nothing to be done
until nine o'clock."</p>

<p>"Till nine o'clock," she repeated aghast. "But you can do
something, certainly! You can come to the jail with me and see
that they don't hurt him any more."</p>

<p>"We aren't permitted to do anything like that. The Consulate
handles these things. The Consulate will be open at nine."</p>

<p>His face, constrained to impassivity by the binding strap,
infuriated Baby.</p>

<p>"I can't wait until nine. My brother-in-law says they've put
his eye out&#151;he's seriously hurt! I have to get to him. I have to
find a doctor." She let herself go and began to cry angrily as
she talked, for she knew that he would respond to her agitation
rather than her words. "You've got to do something about this.
It's your business to protect American citizens in trouble."</p>

<p>But he was of the Eastern seaboard and too hard for her.
Shaking his head patiently at her failure to understand his
position he drew the Persian robe closer about him and came down
a few steps.</p>

<p>"Write down the address of the Consulate for this lady," he
said to the porter, "and look up Doctor Colazzo's address and
telephone number and write that down too." He turned to Baby,
with the expression of an exasperated Christ. "My dear lady, the
diplomatic corps represents the Government of the United States
to the Government of Italy. It has nothing to do with the
protection of citizens, except under specific instructions from
the State Department. Your brother-in-law has broken the laws of
this country and been put in jail, just as an Italian might be
put in jail in New York. The only people who can let him go are
the Italian courts and if your brother-in-law has a case you can
get aid and advice from the Consulate, which protects the rights
of American citizens. The consulate does not open until nine
o'clock. Even if it were my brother I couldn't do anything&#151;"</p>

<p>"Can you phone the Consulate?" she broke in.</p>

<p>"We can't interfere with the Consulate. When the Consul gets
there at nine&#151;"</p>

<p>"Can you give me his home address?"</p>

<p>After a fractional pause the man shook his head. He took the
memorandum from the porter and gave it to her.</p>

<p>"Now I'll ask you to excuse me."</p>

<p>He had manoeuvred her to the door: for an instant the violet
dawn fell shrilly upon his pink mask and upon the linen sack that
supported his mustache; then Baby was standing on the front steps
alone. She had been in the embassy ten minutes.</p>

<p>The piazza whereon it faced was empty save for an old man
gathering cigarette butts with a spiked stick. Baby caught a taxi
presently and went to the Consulate but there was no one there
save a trio of wretched women scrubbing the stairs. She could not
make them understand that she wanted the Consul's home
address&#151;in a sudden resurgence of anxiety she rushed out and
told the chauffeur to take her to the jail. He did not know where
it was, but by the use of the words <i>semper dritte, dextra</i>
and <i>sinestra</i> she manoeuvred him to its approximate
locality, where she dismounted and explored a labyrinth of
familiar alleys. But the buildings and the alleys all looked
alike. Emerging from one trail into the Piazzo d'Espagna she saw
the American Express Company and her heart lifted at the word
"American" on the sign. There was a light in the window and
hurrying across the square she tried the door, but it was locked,
and inside the clock stood at seven. Then she thought of Collis
Clay.</p>

<p>She remembered the name of his hotel, a stuffy villa sealed in
red plush across from the Excelsior. The woman on duty at the
office was not disposed to help her&#151;she had no authority to
disturb Mr. Clay, and refused to let Miss Warren go up to his
room alone; convinced finally that this was not an affair of
passion she accompanied her.</p>

<p>Collis lay naked upon his bed. He had come in tight and,
awakening, it took him some moments to realize his nudity. He
atoned for it by an excess of modesty. Taking his clothes into
the bathroom he dressed in haste, muttering to himself "Gosh. She
certainly musta got a good look at me." After some telephoning,
he and Baby found the jail and went to it.</p>

<p>The cell door was open and Dick was slumped on a chair in the
guard-room. The carabinieri had washed some of the blood from his
face, brushed him and set his hat concealingly upon his head.</p>

<p>Baby stood in the doorway trembling.</p>

<p>"Mr. Clay will stay with you," she said. "I want to get the
Consul and a doctor."</p>

<p>"All right."</p>

<p>"Just stay quiet."</p>

<p>"All right."</p>

<p>"I'll be back."</p>

<p>She drove to the Consulate; it was after eight now, and she
was permitted to sit in the ante-room. Toward nine the Consul
came in and Baby, hysterical with impotence and exhaustion,
repeated her story. The Consul was disturbed. He warned her
against getting into brawls in strange cities, but he was chiefly
concerned that she should wait outside&#151;with despair she read in
his elderly eye that he wanted to be mixed up as little as
possible in this catastrophe. Waiting on his action, she passed
the minutes by phoning a doctor to go to Dick. There were other
people in the ante-room and several were admitted to the Consul's
office. After half an hour she chose the moment of some one's
coming out and pushed past the secretary into the room.</p>

<p>"This is outrageous! An American has been beaten half to death
and thrown into prison and you make no move to help."</p>

<p>"Just a minute, Mrs&#151;"</p>

<p>"I've waited long enough. You come right down to the jail and
get him out!"</p>

<p>"Mrs&#151;"</p>

<p>"We're people of considerable standing in America&#151;" Her mouth
hardened as she continued. "If it wasn't for the scandal we
can&#151;I shall see that your indifference to this matter is
reported in the proper quarter. If my brother-in-law were a
British citizen he'd have been free hours ago, but you're more
concerned with what the police will think than about what you're
here for."</p>

<p>"Mrs.&#151;"</p>

<p>"You put on your hat and come with me right away."</p>

<p>The mention of his hat alarmed the Consul who began to clean
his spectacles hurriedly and to ruffle his papers. This proved of
no avail: the American Woman, aroused, stood over him; the
clean-sweeping irrational temper that had broken the moral back
of a race and made a nursery out of a continent, was too much for
him. He rang for the vice-consul&#151;Baby had won.</p>





<p>Dick sat in the sunshine that fell profusely through the
guard-room window. Collis was with him and two carabinieri, and
they were waiting for something to happen. With the narrowed
vision of his one eye Dick could see the carabinieri; they were
Tuscan peasants with short upper lips and he found it difficult
to associate them with the brutality of last night. He sent one
of them to fetch him a glass of beer.</p>

<p>The beer made him light-headed and the episode was momentarily
illumined by a ray of sardonic humor. Collis was under the
impression that the English girl had something to do with the
catastrophe, but Dick was sure she had disappeared long before it
happened. Collis was still absorbed by the fact that Miss Warren
had found him naked on his bed.</p>

<p>Dick's rage had retreated into him a little and he felt a vast
criminal irresponsibility. What had happened to him was so awful
that nothing could make any difference unless he could choke it
to death, and, as this was unlikely, he was hopeless. He would be
a different person henceforward, and in his raw state he had
bizarre feelings of what the new self would be. The matter had
about it the impersonal quality of an act of God. No mature Aryan
is able to profit by a humiliation; when he forgives it has
become part of his life, he has identified himself with the thing
which has humiliated him&#151;an upshot that in this case was
impossible.</p>

<p>When Collis spoke of retribution, Dick shook his head and was
silent. A lieutenant of carabinieri, pressed, burnished, vital,
came into the room like three men and the guards jumped to
attention. He seized the empty beer bottle and directed a stream
of scolding at his men. The new spirit was in him, and the first
thing was to get the beer bottle out of the guard-room. Dick
looked at Collis and laughed.</p>

<p>The vice-consul, an over-worked young man named Swanson,
arrived, and they started to the court; Collis and Swanson on
either side of Dick and the two carabinieri close behind. It was
a yellow, hazy morning; the squares and arcades were crowded and
Dick, pulling his hat low over his head, walked fast, setting the
pace, until one of the short-legged carabinieri ran alongside and
protested. Swanson arranged matters.</p>

<p>"I've disgraced you, haven't I?" said Dick jovially.</p>

<p>"You're liable to get killed fighting Italians," replied
Swanson sheepishly. "They'll probably let you go this time but if
you were an Italian you'd get a couple of months in prison. And
how!"</p>

<p>"Have you ever been in prison?"</p>

<p>Swanson laughed.</p>

<p>"I like him," announced Dick to Clay. "He's a very likeable
young man and he gives people excellent advice, but I'll bet he's
been to jail himself. Probably spent weeks at a time in
jail."</p>

<p>Swanson laughed.</p>

<p>"I mean you want to be careful. You don't know how these
people are."</p>

<p>"Oh, I know how they are," broke out Dick, irritably. "They're
god damn stinkers." He turned around to the carabinieri: "Did you
get that?"</p>

<p>"I'm leaving you here," Swanson said quickly. "I told your
sister-in-law I would&#151;our lawyer will meet you upstairs in the
courtroom. You want to be careful."</p>

<p>"Good-by." Dick shook hands politely. "Thank you very much. I
feel you have a future&#151;"</p>

<p>With another smile Swanson hurried away, resuming his official
expression of disapproval.</p>

<p>Now they came into a courtyard on all four sides of which
outer stairways mounted to the chambers above. As they crossed
the flags a groaning, hissing, booing sound went up from the
loiterers in the courtyard, voices full of fury and scorn. Dick
stared about.</p>

<p>"What's that?" he demanded, aghast.</p>

<p>One of the carabinieri spoke to a group of men and the sound
died away.</p>

<p>They came into the court-room. A shabby Italian lawyer from
the Consulate spoke at length to the judge while Dick and Collis
waited aside. Some one who knew English turned from the window
that gave on the yard and explained the sound that had
accompanied their passage through. A native of Frascati had raped
and slain a five-year-old child and was to be brought in that
morning&#151;the crowd had assumed it was Dick.</p>

<p>In a few minutes the lawyer told Dick that he was freed&#151;the
court considered him punished enough.</p>

<p>"Enough!" Dick cried. "Punished for what?"</p>

<p>"Come along," said Collis. "You can't do anything now."</p>

<p>"But what did I do, except get into a fight with some
taxi-men?"</p>

<p>"They claim you went up to a detective as if you were going to
shake hands with him and hit him&#151;"</p>

<p>"That's not true! I told him I was going to hit him&#151;I didn't
know he was a detective."</p>

<p>"You better go along," urged the lawyer.</p>

<p>"Come along." Collis took his arm and they descended the
steps.</p>

<p>"I want to make a speech," Dick cried. "I want to explain to
these people how I raped a five-year-old girl. Maybe I did&#151;"</p>

<p>"Come along."</p>

<p>Baby was waiting with a doctor in a taxi-cab. Dick did not
want to look at her and he disliked the doctor, whose stern
manner revealed him as one of that least palpable of European
types, the Latin moralist. Dick summed up his conception of the
disaster, but no one had much to say. In his room in the Quirinal
the doctor washed off the rest of the blood and the oily sweat,
set his nose, his fractured ribs and fingers, disinfected the
smaller wounds and put a hopeful dressing on the eye. Dick asked
for a quarter of a grain of morphine, for he was still wide awake
and full of nervous energy. With the morphine he fell asleep; the
doctor and Collis left and Baby waited with him until a woman
could arrive from the English nursing home. It had been a hard
night but she had the satisfaction of feeling that, whatever
Dick's previous record was, they now possessed a moral
superiority over him for as long as he proved of any use.</p>
