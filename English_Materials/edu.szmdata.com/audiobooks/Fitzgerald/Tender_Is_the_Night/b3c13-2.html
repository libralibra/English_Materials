<p>Nicole kept in touch with Dick after her new marriage; there
were letters on business matters, and about the children. When
she said, as she often did, "I loved Dick and I'll never forget
him," Tommy answered, "Of course not&#151;why should you?"</p>

<p>Dick opened an office in Buffalo, but evidently without
success. Nicole did not find what the trouble was, but she heard
a few months later that he was in a little town named Batavia,
N.Y., practising general medicine, and later that he was in
Lockport, doing the same thing. By accident she heard more about
his life there than anywhere: that he bicycled a lot, was much
admired by the ladies, and always had a big stack of papers on
his desk that were known to be an important treatise on some
medical subject, almost in process of completion. He was
considered to have fine manners and once made a good speech at a
public health meeting on the subject of drugs; but he became
entangled with a girl who worked in a grocery store, and he was
also involved in a lawsuit about some medical question; so he
left Lockport.</p>

<p>After that he didn't ask for the children to be sent to
America and didn't answer when Nicole wrote asking him if he
needed money. In the last letter she had from him he told her
that he was practising in Geneva, New York, and she got the
impression that he had settled down with some one to keep house
for him. She looked up Geneva in an atlas and found it was in the
heart of the Finger Lakes Section and considered a pleasant
place. Perhaps, so she liked to think, his career was biding its
time, again like Grant's in Galena; his latest note was
post-marked from Hornell, New York, which is some distance from
Geneva and a very small town; in any case he is almost certainly
in that section of the country, in one town or another.</p>
