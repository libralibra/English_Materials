<p class="storyTitle">XXII</p>





<p>There were five people in the Quirinal bar after dinner, a
high-class Italian frail who sat on a stool making persistent
conversation against the bartender's bored: "Si . . . Si . . .
Si," a light, snobbish Egyptian who was lonely but chary of the
woman, and the two Americans.</p>

<p>Dick was always vividly conscious of his surroundings, while
Collis Clay lived vaguely, the sharpest impressions dissolving
upon a recording apparatus that had early atrophied, so the
former talked and the latter listened, like a man sitting in a
breeze.</p>

<p>Dick, worn away by the events of the afternoon, was taking it
out on the inhabitants of Italy. He looked around the bar as if
he hoped an Italian had heard him and would resent his words.</p>

<p>"This afternoon I had tea with my sister-in-law at the
Excelsior. We got the last table and two men came up and looked
around for a table and couldn't find one. So one of them came up
to us and said, 'Isn't this table reserved for the Princess
Orsini?' and I said: 'There was no sign on it,' and he said: 'But
I think it's reserved for the Princess Orsini.' I couldn't even
answer him."</p>

<p>"What'd he do?"</p>

<p>"He retired." Dick switched around in his chair. "I don't like
these people. The other day I left Rosemary for two minutes in
front of a store and an officer started walking up and down in
front of her, tipping his hat."</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Collis after a moment. "I'd rather be
here than up in Paris with somebody picking your pocket every
minute."</p>

<p>He had been enjoying himself, and he held out against anything
that threatened to dull his pleasure.</p>

<p>"I don't know," he persisted. "I don't mind it here."</p>

<p>Dick evoked the picture that the few days had imprinted on his
mind, and stared at it. The walk toward the American Express past
the odorous confectioneries of the Via Nationale, through the
foul tunnel up to the Spanish Steps, where his spirit soared
before the flower stalls and the house where Keats had died. He
cared only about people; he was scarcely conscious of places
except for their weather, until they had been invested with color
by tangible events. Rome was the end of his dream of
Rosemary.</p>

<p>A bell-boy came in and gave him a note.</p>

<p><i>"I</i> <i>did not go to the party,"</i> it said. <i>"I</i>
<i>am in my room. We leave for Livorno early in the
morning."</i></p>

<p>Dick handed the note and a tip to the boy.</p>

<p>"Tell Miss Hoyt you couldn't find me." Turning to Collis he
suggested the Bonbonieri.</p>

<p>They inspected the tart at the bar, granting her the minimum
of interest exacted by her profession, and she stared back with
bright boldness; they went through the deserted lobby oppressed
by draperies holding Victorian dust in stuffy folds, and they
nodded at the night concierge who returned the gesture with the
bitter servility peculiar to night servants. Then in a taxi they
rode along cheerless streets through a dank November night. There
were no women in the streets, only pale men with dark coats
buttoned to the neck, who stood in groups beside shoulders of
cold stone.</p>

<p>"My God!" Dick sighed.</p>

<p>"What's a matter?"</p>

<p>"I was thinking of that man this afternoon: 'This table is
reserved for the Princess Orsini.' Do you know what these old
Roman families are? They're bandits, they're the ones who got
possession of the temples and palaces after Rome went to pieces
and preyed on the people."</p>

<p>"I like Rome," insisted Collis. "Why won't you try the
races?"</p>

<p>"I don't like races."</p>

<p>"But all the women turn out&#151;"</p>

<p>"I know I wouldn't like anything here. I like France, where
everybody thinks he's Napoleon&#151;down here everybody thinks he's
Christ."</p>

<p>At the Bonbonieri they descended to a panelled cabaret,
hopelessly impermanent amid the cold stone. A listless band
played a tango and a dozen couples covered the wide floor with
those elaborate and dainty steps so offensive to the American
eye. A surplus of waiters precluded the stir and bustle that even
a few busy men can create; over the scene as its form of
animation brooded an air of waiting for something, for the dance,
the night, the balance of forces which kept it stable, to cease.
It assured the impressionable guest that whatever he was seeking
he would not find it here.</p>

<p>This was plain as plain to Dick. He looked around, hoping his
eye would catch on something, so that spirit instead of
imagination could carry on for an hour. But there was nothing and
after a moment he turned back to Collis. He had told Collis some
of his current notions, and he was bored with his audience's
short memory and lack of response. After half an hour of Collis
he felt a distinct lesion of his own vitality.</p>

<p>They drank a bottle of Italian mousseaux, and Dick became pale
and somewhat noisy. He called the orchestra leader over to their
table; this was a Bahama Negro, conceited and unpleasant, and in
a few minutes there was a row.</p>

<p>"You asked me to sit down."</p>

<p>"All right. And I gave you fifty lire, didn't I?"</p>

<p>"All right. All right. All right."</p>

<p>"All right, I gave you fifty lire, didn't I? Then you come up
and asked me to put some more in the horn!"</p>

<p>"You asked me to sit down, didn't you? Didn't you?"</p>

<p>"I asked you to sit down but I gave you fifty lire, didn't
I?"</p>

<p>"All right. All right."</p>

<p>The Negro got up sourly and went away, leaving Dick in a still
more evil humor. But he saw a girl smiling at him from across the
room and immediately the pale Roman shapes around him receded
into decent, humble perspective. She was a young English girl,
with blonde hair and a healthy, pretty English face and she
smiled at him again with an invitation he understood, that denied
the flesh even in the act of tendering it.</p>

<p>"There's a quick trick or else I don't know bridge," said
Collis.</p>

<p>Dick got up and walked to her across the room.</p>

<p>"Won't you dance?"</p>

<p>The middle-aged Englishman with whom she was sitting said,
almost apologetically: "I'm going out soon."</p>

<p>Sobered by excitement Dick danced. He found in the girl a
suggestion of all the pleasant English things; the story of safe
gardens ringed around by the sea was implicit in her bright voice
and as he leaned back to look at her, he meant what he said to
her so sincerely that his voice trembled. When her current escort
should leave, she promised to come and sit with them. The
Englishman accepted her return with repeated apologies and
smiles.</p>

<p>Back at his table Dick ordered another bottle of spumante.</p>

<p>"She looks like somebody in the movies," he said. "I can't
think who." He glanced impatiently over his shoulder. "Wonder
what's keeping her?"</p>

<p>"I'd like to get in the movies," said Collis thoughtfully.
"I'm supposed to go into my father's business but it doesn't
appeal to me much. Sit in an office in Birmingham for twenty
years&#151;"</p>

<p>His voice resisted the pressure of materialistic
civilization.</p>

<p>"Too good for it?" suggested Dick.</p>

<p>"No, I don't mean that."</p>

<p>"Yes, you do."</p>

<p>"How do you know what I mean? Why don't you practise as a
doctor, if you like to work so much?"</p>

<p>Dick had made them both wretched by this time, but
simultaneously they had become vague with drink and in a moment
they forgot; Collis left, and they shook hands warmly.</p>

<p>"Think it over," said Dick sagely.</p>

<p>"Think what over?"</p>

<p>"You know." It had been something about Collis going into his
father's business&#151;good sound advice.</p>

<p>Clay walked off into space. Dick finished his bottle and then
danced with the English girl again, conquering his unwilling body
with bold revolutions and stern determined marches down the
floor. The most remarkable thing suddenly happened. He was
dancing with the girl, the music stopped&#151;and she had
disappeared.</p>

<p>"Have you seen her?"</p>

<p>"Seen who?"</p>

<p>"The girl I was dancing with. Su'nly disappeared. Must be in
the building."</p>

<p>"No! No! That's the ladies' room."</p>

<p>He stood up by the bar. There were two other men there, but he
could think of no way of starting a conversation. He could have
told them all about Rome and the violent origins of the Colonna
and Gaetani families but he realized that as a beginning that
would be somewhat abrupt. A row of Yenci dolls on the cigar
counter fell suddenly to the floor; there was a subsequent
confusion and he had a sense of having been the cause of it, so
he went back to the cabaret and drank a cup of black coffee.
Collis was gone and the English girl was gone and there seemed
nothing to do but go back to the hotel and lie down with his
black heart. He paid his check and got his hat and coat.</p>

<p>There was dirty water in the gutters and between the rough
cobblestones; a marshy vapor from the Campagna, a sweat of
exhausted cultures tainted the morning air. A quartet of
taxi-drivers, their little eyes bobbing in dark pouches,
surrounded him. One who leaned insistently in his face he pushed
harshly away.</p>

<p>"Quanto a Hotel Quirinal?"</p>

<p>"Cento lire."</p>

<p>Six dollars. He shook his head and offered thirty lire which
was twice the day-time fare, but they shrugged their shoulders as
one pair, and moved off.</p>

<p>"Trente-cinque lire e mancie," he said firmly.</p>

<p>"Cento lire."</p>

<p>He broke into English.</p>

<p>"To go half a mile? You'll take me for forty lire."</p>

<p>"Oh, no."</p>

<p>He was very tired. He pulled open the door of a cab and got
in.</p>

<p>"Hotel Quirinal!" he said to the driver who stood obstinately
outside the window. "Wipe that sneer off your face and take me to
the Quirinal."</p>

<p>"Ah, no."</p>

<p>Dick got out. By the door of the Bonbonieri some one was
arguing with the taxi-drivers, some one who now tried to explain
their attitude to Dick; again one of the men pressed close,
insisting and gesticulating and Dick shoved him away.</p>

<p>"I want to go to the Quirinal Hotel."</p>

<p>"He says wan huner lire," explained the interpreter.</p>

<p>"I understand. I'll give him fif'y lire. Go on away." This
last to the insistent man who had edged up once more. The man
looked at him and spat contemptuously.</p>

<p>The passionate impatience of the week leaped up in Dick and
clothed itself like a flash in violence, the honorable, the
traditional resource of his land; he stepped forward and slapped
the man's face.</p>

<p>They surged about him, threatening, waving their arms, trying
ineffectually to close in on him&#151;with his back against the wall
Dick hit out clumsily, laughing a little and for a few minutes
the mock fight, an affair of foiled rushes and padded, glancing
blows, swayed back and forth in front of the door. Then Dick
tripped and fell; he was hurt somewhere but he struggled up again
wrestling in arms that suddenly broke apart. There was a new
voice and a new argument but he leaned against the wall, panting
and furious at the indignity of his position. He saw there was no
sympathy for him but he was unable to believe that he was
wrong.</p>

<p>They were going to the police station and settle it there. His
hat was retrieved and handed to him, and with some one holding
his arm lightly he strode around the corner with the taxi-men and
entered a bare barrack where carabinieri lounged under a single
dim light.</p>

<p>At a desk sat a captain, to whom the officious individual who
had stopped the battle spoke at length in Italian, at times
pointing at Dick, and letting himself be interrupted by the
taxi-men who delivered short bursts of invective and
denunciation. The captain began to nod impatiently. He held up
his hand and the hydra-headed address, with a few parting
exclamations, died away. Then he turned to Dick.</p>

<p>"Spick Italiano?" he asked.</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Spick Français?"</p>

<p>"Oui," said Dick, glowering.</p>

<p>"Alors. Écoute. Va au Quirinal. Espèce
d'endormi. Écoute: vous êtes saoûl. Payez ce
que le chauffeur demande. Comprenez-vous?"</p>

<p>Diver shook his head.</p>

<p>"Non, je ne veux pas."</p>

<p><i>"Come?"</i></p>

<p>"Je paierai quarante lires. C'est bien assez."</p>

<p>The captain stood up.</p>

<p>"Écoute!" he cried portentously. "Vous êtes
saoûl. Vous avez battu le chauffeur. Comme ci, comme
ça." He struck the air excitedly with right hand and left,
"C'est bon que je vous donne la liberté. Payez ce qu'il a
dit&#151;cento lire. Va au Quirinal."</p>

<p>Raging with humiliation, Dick stared back at him.</p>

<p>"All right." He turned blindly to the door&#151;before him,
leering and nodding, was the man who had brought him to the
police station. "I'll go home," he shouted, "but first I'll fix
this baby."</p>

<p>He walked past the staring carabinieri and up to the grinning
face, hit it with a smashing left beside the jaw. The man dropped
to the floor.</p>

<p>For a moment he stood over him in savage triumph&#151;but even as
a first pang of doubt shot through him the world reeled; he was
clubbed down, and fists and boots beat on him in a savage tattoo.
He felt his nose break like a shingle and his eyes jerk as if
they had snapped back on a rubber band into his head. A rib
splintered under a stamping heel. Momentarily he lost
consciousness, regained it as he was raised to a sitting position
and his wrists jerked together with handcuffs. He struggled
automatically. The plainclothes lieutenant whom he had knocked
down, stood dabbing his jaw with a handkerchief and looking into
it for blood; he came over to Dick, poised himself, drew back his
arm and smashed him to the floor.</p>

<p>When Doctor Diver lay quite still a pail of water was sloshed
over him. One of his eyes opened dimly as he was being dragged
along by the wrists through a bloody haze and he made out the
human and ghastly face of one of the taxi-drivers.</p>

<p>"Go to the Excelsior hotel," he cried faintly. "Tell Miss
Warren. Two hundred lire! Miss Warren. Due centi lire! Oh, you
dirty&#151;you God&#151;"</p>

<p>Still he was dragged along through the bloody haze, choking
and sobbing, over vague irregular surfaces into some small place
where he was dropped upon a stone floor. The men went out, a door
clanged, he was alone.</p>
