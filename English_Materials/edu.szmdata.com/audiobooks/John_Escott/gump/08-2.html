<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER NINE</p>

<p class="centeredBold">A Real Idiot</p>

<p>Of course, the first thing that I wanted to do when I got back to America was find Jenny. So I phoned Moses in Boston. </p>

<p>'The Broken Eggs group has broken up,' he told me. 'I don't know what happened to Jenny. I heard that she went to Chicago, but that was five years ago.'</p>

<p>'Do you have a telephone number, or anything?' I asked.</p>

<p>'It's an old number,' he said, 'but perhaps she's still there.'</p>

<p>I phoned the number, and she wasn't.</p>

<p>'Jenny Curran?' a man's voice said. 'She went to Indianapolis. Got a job at the Temperer factory.'</p>

<p>So I went to Indianapolis on the bus.</p>

<hr/>

<p>The Temperer factory was outside the town. I asked about Jenny at the office, and the woman said, 'Yes, she works in here. Why don't you wait at the side of the factory? It's almost lunch-time, and she'll probably come out.' So I did.</p>

<p>A lot of people came out at lunch-time. Then Jenny came out. She went and sat under a tree on the grass, and began eating an apple. I went up behind her and said, 'That looks like a nice apple.' She didn't look up. She just said, 'Forrest, it has to be you.'</p>

<p>A minute later, I had my arms round her and we were both crying. People were watching us with strange looks on their faces, but it didn't matter. Jenny and me were together again.</p>

<p>'I finish work in three hours, Forrest,' Jenny said. 'Why don't you wait for me in that bar across the street? Then I'll take you to my place.'</p>

<p>So I waited in the bar.</p>

<p>And I got into the wrestling business. How? I'll tell you.</p>

<p>It started when I arm-wrestled a man in the bar, and won some money on a bet. That gave me an idea. But at first I didn't say anything to Jenny.</p>

<p>She came across to the bar after work, and we had a drink and talked.</p>

<p>'I saw you on TV when you went up into space, Forrest,' she said. </p>

<p>And I told her all about that, and about Sue, the ape.</p>

<p>'What happened to him?' she asked.</p>

<p>'I don't know,' I said. 'But he was a good friend.'</p>

<p>Later, we went back to Jenny's flat, and she said, 'You can stay here.'</p>

<p>Next day, when Jenny went to work, I went back to the bar. Several people wanted to try arm-wrestling with me again, and I said OK. None of them won because I was too strong, but plenty of people wanted to try their luck.</p>

<p>After about a month, I was winning nearly two hundred dollars a week, arm-wrestling. Then one day a man called Mike came into the bar.</p>

<p>'You can make a lot more money,' he told me.</p>

<p>'How?' I asked.</p>

<p>'Wrestling. Real wrestling,' he said. 'I can teach you.'</p>

<p>To make a long story short - he did.</p>

<p>Jenny wasn't happy about the wrestling but I won a lot of money - sometimes by winning fights, sometimes by losing them because Mike told me to lose them. Yes, that happens, too. But then I did something stupid again. I bet on myself winning a fight, after Mike told me to lose it.</p>

<p>Jenny got really angry. 'It isn't honest,' she said.</p>

<p>I didn't listen. I bet all my money on myself to win - and then I lost the fight.</p>

<p>But there was worse to come. When I got back to the flat, Jenny was gone, and there was a letter waiting for me. It said:</p>

<p>Dear Forrest</p>

<p>You're doing something bad tonight. It isn't honest, and I cannot go on with you like this. I think about having a house and a family and things like that now. I watched you grow up big and strong and good. And then, in Boston, I realized that I loved you, and I was the happiest girl in the world. But then there was that girl outside the Hodaddy Club. Then you went up into space and I lost you for four years, and I think you changed. And I think perhaps I changed, too. I just want to live in an ordinary way now. So, I must go and find it.</p>

<p>I am crying while I write this, but please don't try to find me. </p>

<p>Goodbye, my dear. love, Jenny</p>

<p>And for the first time ever, I knew that I was a real idiot.</p><br class="calibre3" id="calibre_pb_8"/>
