<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER TWELVE</p>

<p class="centeredBold">Little Forrest</p>

<p>Sue and I got off the bus at Savannah, then I went and got a cup of coffee and sat outside the bus station. What could I do next? I didn't know. So after I finished my cup of coffee, I took out my harmonica and began to play. I played two songs - and a man walked past and threw some money into my empty coffee cup! I played two more songs, and soon the cup was half full of money!</p>

<p>By the end of the next week, we were getting ten dollars a day. Then, one afternoon when I was playing to some people in the park, I noticed that a little boy was watching me carefully. Then I looked up and saw a woman who was standing near him.</p>

<p>It was Jenny Curran. </p>

<p>Her hair was different, and she looked a bit older, and a bit tired, but it was her all right. And when I finished playing, she held the little boy's hand and came across.</p>

<p>She was smiling. 'Oh, Forrest, I knew it was you when I heard that harmonica. Nobody plays the harmonica like you do.'</p>

<p>'What are you doing here?' I asked her.</p>

<p>'We live here now,' she said. 'Donald works in a business here in Savannah. We came here about three years ago.'</p>

<p>When I stopped playing, the rest of the people walked away. Jenny sat next to me while the little boy started playing with Sue.</p>

<p>'Why are you playing your harmonica in the park?' asked Jenny. 'Mom wrote and told me about your shrimp business, and how rich you were.'</p>

<p>'It's a long story,' I said. 'Is that your little boy?'</p>

<p>'Yes,' she said.</p>

<p>'What do you call him?'</p>

<p>'His name is Forrest,' she said quietly. Then she went on, 'He's half yours. He's your son, Forrest.'</p>

<p>I looked at the boy, who was still playing with Sue. 'My... son?'</p>

<p>'I knew that a baby was on the way when I left Indianapolis,' said Jenny, 'but I didn't want to say anything. I don't know why. I was worried that perhaps -'</p>

<p>'Perhaps he would be an idiot,' I finished for her.</p>

<p>'Yes. But Forrest, he's not an idiot, he's really clever.'</p>

<p>'Are you sure that he's mine?' I asked.</p>

<p>'I'm sure,' said Jenny. 'He wants to be a football player.'</p>

<p>I looked at the boy. 'Can I see him for a minute or two?'</p>

<p>'Of course,' said Jenny, and she called to him. 'Forrest, I want you to meet another Forrest. He's an old friend of mine.'</p>

<p>The boy came and sat down. 'What a funny animal you've got,' he said.</p>

<p>'He's an ape,' I said. 'His name is Sue.'</p>

<p>'Why is it called Sue if it's a he?' </p>

<p>I knew then that I didn't have an idiot for a son. 'Your Mom tells me that you want to be a football player.'</p>

<p>'Yes,' he said. 'Do you know anything about football?'</p>

<p>'A bit,' I said. 'But ask your daddy. He'll know more than me.'</p>

<p>He put his arms round me for a second, then went off to play with Sue again.</p>

<p>Jenny looked at me. 'How long have we been friends, Forrest? Thirty years? Sometimes it doesn't seem true.' She moved nearer, and gave me a kiss. 'Idiots,' said Jenny. 'Who isn't an idiot?'</p>

<p>Then she got up and held little Forrest's hand, and they walked away.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Well, after that, I did a few things. First I phoned Mr Tribble and told him to give some of my money from the shrimp business to my Mom, and some to Bubba's daddy.</p>

<p>'Then send the rest to Jenny and little Forrest,' I said.</p>

<p>That night I sat up thinking. 'Perhaps I can put things right with Jenny,' I thought, 'now that I've found her again.' But the more I thought about it, the more I finally understood that it was better for the boy to be with Jenny and her husband, and not to have an idiot for a father.</p>

<p>An idiot? Yes, I'm an idiot. But most of the time I just try to do the right thing.</p>

<p>- THE END -</p>
