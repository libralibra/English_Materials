<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER TWO</p>

<p class="centeredBold">Life at University</p>

<p>When we got to the university, Coach Bryant came to talk to us.</p>

<p>'Last man to get to the practice field will get a ride there on my shoe!' he shouted at us. And he meant it when he said that kind of thing. We soon learned that.</p>

<p>The building that I went to live in was nice on the outside but not on the inside. Most of the doors and windows were broken, and the floor was dirty. I lived in a room with a man called Curtis. He crashed into the room with a wild look in his eyes. He wasn't very tall, but he was very strong. 'Where are you from?' he asked.</p>

<p>'Mobile,' I told him.</p>

<p>'That's a stupid town!' he said.</p>

<p>And that was all of our conversation for several days.</p>

<p>On the practice field, things didn't start very well. I got the ball, but I ran the wrong way with it, and everybody got angry and started shouting at me.</p>

<p>But Coach Bryant called me across. 'Just get in the line and start catching the ball,' he told me.</p>

<p>And then I told him something that he didn't want to hear.</p>

<p>'They never taught me to catch a ball at high school,' I said. 'It was difficult enough for me just to remember where our goal line was.'</p>

<p>I don't think he was very pleased. But he started to teach me to catch.</p>

<p>I wanted my Mom, and I wanted to go home. I didn't like that place.</p>

<p>And Curtis was always angry, and I couldn't understand him. He had a car, and sometimes he gave me a ride to the practice field. But one day when he had to change a wheel on the car, I helped him.</p>

<p>'If you're an idiot,' he said, angrily, 'how do you know how to do that?'</p>

<p>'Maybe I am an idiot,' I said, 'but I'm not stupid.'</p>

<p>Then Curtis ran after me, and called me all kinds of terrible names.</p>

<p>After that, I moved my bed to another room.</p>

<hr/>

<p>The first football game was on Saturday. I ran well, and we won 35 to 3. Everybody was pleased with me. I phoned Mom to tell her.</p>

<p>'I heard the game on the radio!' she said. 'I was so happy, I wanted to cry!' </p>

<p>That night, everybody went to parties, but nobody asked me to go. I went back to my room, but I heard music from somewhere upstairs. I found a young man who was sitting in his room playing the harmonica.</p>

<p>His name was Bubba. He broke his foot in football practice and couldn't play in the game. I sat and listened to him. We didn't talk, but after about an hour, I asked, 'Can I try it?' and he said 'OK', and gave me the harmonica. I began to play.</p>

<p>After several minutes, Bubba was getting really excited and saying, 'Good, good, good!' Then he asked, 'Where did you learn to play like that?'</p>

<p>'I didn't learn anywhere,' I said.</p>

<p>When it got late, he told me to take the harmonica with me, and I played it for a long time in my room. </p>

<p>Next day I took it back to Bubba.</p>

<p>'Keep it,' he said. 'I've got another one.'</p>

<p>I was really happy, and I went and sat under a tree and played all day.</p>

<p>It was late afternoon when I began to walk back to my room. Suddenly, I heard a voice shout, 'Forrest!' I turned round - and saw Jenny!</p>

<p>She had a big smile on her face, and she held my hand.</p>

<p>'I saw you play football yesterday,' she said. 'You were wonderful!'</p>

<p>She wasn't angry about the cinema, and she asked me to have a drink with her!</p>

<p>'I'm taking lessons in music, and I want to be a singer,' she told me. 'I play in a little group. We're playing at the Students' Centre tomorrow night. Why don't you come and listen?'</p>

<p>'OK,' I said.</p><br class="calibre3" id="calibre_pb_1"/>
