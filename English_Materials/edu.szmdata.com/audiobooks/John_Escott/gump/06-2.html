<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER SEVEN</p>

<p class="centeredBold">Meeting Jenny Again</p>

<p>Soon after that, I heard that I was leaving the army early, and they gave me some money for a train ticket to go home.</p>

<p>But all this time, I was thinking about Jenny Curran. Just before I left the hospital in Danang, I had a letter from her. She was now playing in a group called The Broken Eggs, and they played two nights each week at a place called the Hodaddy Club near Harvard University. Now that I was free from the army, I just wanted to go and see her. So I got a ticket for Boston, instead of Mobile.</p>

<p>I tried to walk to the Hodaddy Club from the train station, but I lost my way, so I took a taxi. It was in the afternoon, and the man behind the bar said, Jenny'll be here about nine o'clock.'</p>

<p>'Can I wait?' I asked.</p>

<p>'OK,' he said.</p>

<p>So I sat down and waited for five or six hours.</p>

<p>Students began to come in, most of them wearing dirty jeans. The men had beards, and the women had long, untidy hair. Later, the group - The Broken Eggs - arrived, but I didn't see Jenny. Then they began to play - and they were loud. The music sounded like a plane that was taking off! But the students loved it.</p>

<p>And then Jenny came on!</p>

<p>She was different. Her hair was all the way down her back, and she was wearing sun-glasses - at night! She was wearing blue jeans and a shirt with lots of colours on it. The group started playing again and Jenny began to sing.</p>

<p>Later, I went outside and walked round for about half an hour, then went back. There were a lot of people waiting to go in, so I went round to the back of the place and sat on the ground. I had my harmonica in my pocket, so I took it out and started to play. </p>

<p>I could hear the music that was playing inside and, after a minute or two, I began playing with it. Suddenly, a door behind me opened - and there was Jenny!</p>

<p>'Who is that playing the harmonica?' she said. And then she saw me. 'Forrest Gump!' And she ran out of the door and threw her arms round me.</p>

<hr/>

<p>We talked together until it was time for her to sing again.</p>

<p>'I didn't leave school,' said Jenny. 'They threw me out after they found a boy in my room one night. I went to California and stayed there for some time.' She laughed. 'I wore flowers in my hair, and talked about love. But the people that I was with were strange. Then I met a man, and we came to Boston. But he was dangerous. He was against the war, like me, but he blew up buildings and things. I couldn't stay with him. Next, I met a teacher from Harvard University, but he was married. Then I began to sing with The Broken Eggs.'</p>

<p>'Where do you live?' I asked.</p>

<p>'With my boyfriend,' she said. 'He's a student. You can come back and stay with us tonight.'</p>

<p>The boyfriend's name was Rudolph. He was a little man, and he was sitting on the floor with his eyes shut when we got to Jenny's flat.</p>

<p>'Rudolph, this is Forrest,' Jenny said. 'He's a friend of mine from home, and he's going to stay with us for a few days.'</p>

<p>Rudolph didn't speak or open his eyes, but he put up his hand and smiled.</p>

<p>Next morning, when I got up, Rudolph was still sitting on the floor with his eyes shut.</p>

<p>That afternoon, Jenny took me to meet the other people in the group, and that night I began playing my harmonica with them at the Hodaddy Club. It went well, and I played with them every night after that.</p>

<p>Then one day I came back to the flat and Jenny was sitting on the floor.</p>

<p>'Where's Rudolph?' I asked.</p>

<p>'Gone,' she said. 'Walked out, like all the others.' And then she started to cry.</p>

<p>'Don't cry, Jenny,' I said. And I put my arm round her.</p>

<p>Well, it started like that. But the next minute we were kissing and making love! And when we finished, Jenny said, 'Forrest, where have you been all this time?'</p><br class="calibre3" id="calibre_pb_6"/>
