<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER NINE</p>

<p class="centeredBold">New Hope</p>

<p>Summer ended and autumn leaves began to fall. William continued with his life, but he couldn't escape a feeling of emptiness. Every day was the same. He lived through that winter in a dream. Nothing seemed important. And then it was spring.</p>

<p>'We've got something for you,' said Honey, coming into the bookshop. Spike stood behind her in the doorway. 'You'll love me for the rest of your life.'</p>

<p>'What is it?' asked William, interested.</p>

<p>'The phone number of Anna Scott's office in London, and the one in New York. You can ring her! You think about her all the time. Now you can ring her.'</p>

<p>William knew Honey was trying to help. He tried to look pleased. 'Well, thank you. That's great.'</p>

<p>'It is great,' she said, smiling. 'See you tonight.'</p>

<p>Honey and Spike left. William looked at the piece of paper in his hand for a minute. Then, with a sigh, he threw it away.</p>

<p>That evening, the friends met again at Tony's restaurant. Tony's dream was at an end; his restaurant was closing.</p>

<p>Bella spoke for them all. 'Exactly a year ago, this man here started the finest restaurant in London.' The friends all laughed and shouted. 'But&#151;sadly&#151;no one ever came to eat here.'</p>

<p>'Just a very small problem,' said Tony, smiling.</p>

<p>Bella continued. 'And so, from next week, we have to find somewhere new to eat. It's a sad time.' Tony smiled again, but the smile couldn't hide his unhappiness. 'But I just want to say one more thing. Tony, don't think there's something wrong with you. We can't always understand the reasons why things happen. Some things succeed and others fail. Nobody knows why. Some of us get lucky, and some of us&#160;...'</p>

<p>'... lose our jobs,' Bernie finished.</p>

<p>'No!' said Bella, in surprise.</p>

<p>'Yes, it's true,' Bernie replied with a sigh. 'They're changing everything, and there's no place for me. Well, you know I was no good&#160;... '</p>

<p>'So we go down together!' said Tony, lifting his glass to Bernie. 'To Bernie, the worst stockbroker in the world!'</p>

<p>They all laughed and drank.</p>

<p>'I've got something to say, too,' said Honey, standing up. 'Er&#160;... I've decided to get married!' They all looked surprised. 'I've found myself a nice, strange-looking man. I know he'll make me happy for the rest of my life.'</p>

<p>'Wait a minute,' said William. 'I'm your brother and I don't know anything about this.'</p>

<p>'Is it someone we know?' asked Max.</p>

<p>Bernie looked hopeful.</p>

<p>'Yes. I'll tell you when the time is right,' she replied. She sat down again and the conversation turned to other subjects.</p>

<p>While the others were talking, Honey whispered softly to Spike, 'Er, Spike&#160;... It's you.'</p>

<p>'Me?' He looked surprised.</p>

<p>'Yes. What do you think?'</p>

<p>'Well&#160;... yes, great!' He smiled.</p>

<p>'Are there any other important things that anyone wants to say?' Max asked.</p>

<p>'Yes,' William said seriously. 'I want to say that I'm sorry. I'm really sorry for the way I've been for the last six months. I have, as you know, been a little unhappy.'</p>

<p>'A little unhappy? There are dead people that are more fun to be with,' laughed Max.</p>

<p>'But I want to make it clear that I have turned a corner. From today, I have decided to be happy!'</p>

<p>'So, all that business with the American is in the past now?' Max asked.</p>

<p>'I believe it is.' William smiled.</p>

<p>'You don't think about her all the time?'</p>

<p>'No, I don't think I do.'</p>

<p>'So you're not interested that she's back in London? Or that she's filming every day in Hampstead?' Max showed him a newspaper with a picture of Anna on the front page.</p>

<p>William sighed. 'Oh, no!'</p>

<p>'So you are a little interested, then?' said Max.</p>

<p>The following day, William was in Hampstead. He found the place where they were filming.</p>

<p>'Can I help you?' asked a guard.</p>

<p>'Er&#160;... I'm looking for Anna Scott.'</p>

<p>'Does she know you're coming?'</p>

<p>'Er&#160;... no. No, she doesn't.'</p>

<p>'I'm afraid I can't let you in.'</p>

<p>'Oh, right. I mean, she's a friend. But&#160;... you&#160;...'</p>

<p>'... can't let you in,' repeated the guard, turning away.</p>

<p>Behind the guard, William saw Anna walking across the grass. She looked beautiful in a long dress and with her hair piled on top of her head. There were people all around her, ready to help her.</p>

<p>Suddenly, Anna looked up and saw William. Her face showed surprise. William smiled nervously. And then she walked towards him, followed by the crowd of people.</p>

<p>'This is very&#160;... er&#160;...' she started, hesitantly.</p>

<p>'I only found out you were here yesterday.'</p>

<p>'I wanted to ring, but I didn't think you&#160;...' Anna continued.</p>

<p>'Anna, we have to go. They're ready.' It was one of the film people.</p>

<p>'Listen, William. It's not going well&#151;and it's our last day.'</p>

<p>'Yes. Right. You're clearly very busy.'</p>

<p>'But wait. There are&#160;... things to say.'</p>

<p>'OK,' William said.</p>

<p>'You could drink tea. There's lots of tea.' She smiled at him, as she was taken away.</p>

<p>'Come and watch,' a woman said to him. 'Do you like Henry James?'</p>

<p>'This is a Henry James film?' he asked, remembering his conversation with Anna a year earlier.</p>

<p>The woman left William with Harry, a soundman.</p>

<p>'You can listen if you like,' Harry said, pointing to some headphones.</p>

<p>William put them on. Then he sat in a chair to watch the action.</p>

<p>Anna and another actor were making conversation, waiting for the filming. William could hear everything through the headphones.</p>

<p>'So I ask you when you're going to tell everyone. And you say&#160;...?' Anna said to the other actor.</p>

<p>'"Tomorrow will be soon enough."'</p>

<p>'And then I&#160;...'</p>

<p>'Who was that man you were talking to just now?' the other man asked.</p>

<p>'Oh&#151;no one. A man from the past. I don't know what he's doing here. It's difficult.'</p>

<p>William's heart stopped. What was he doing there? He took off the headphones and gave them back to the soundman. 'Thank you, Harry.'</p>

<p>'Any time,' Harry smiled.</p>

<p>William walked away.</p>
