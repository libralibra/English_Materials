<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER SIX</p>

<p class="centeredBold">Room Service</p>

<p>The following evening, William was getting ready to go out. As usual, he was late.</p>

<p>'Spike? Have you seen my glasses?'</p>

<p>'No, I'm afraid not,' Spike answered, his eyes on the TV.</p>

<p>'Oh, no! Where are they? This happens every time I go to the cinema. Usually there are glasses everywhere. But when I really need them, they disappear. It's one of life's little jokes.'</p>

<p>William ran upstairs, then came down again.</p>

<p>'Right, I've got to go,' he called to Spike. 'Thanks very much for your help!'</p>

<p>'You're welcome. Did you find them?'</p>

<p>'No.'</p>

<p>As the door closed behind William, Spike moved on the sofa. Was he sitting on something? He reached down and pulled out William's glasses.</p>

<p>At the cinema, William looked a little strange as he sat next to Anna&#151;beautiful Anna!&#151;in his scuba diving goggles.</p>

<p>After the film, they decided to go for a meal in a Japanese restaurant.</p>

<p>'So who left who?' Anna asked.</p>

<p>'She left me,' replied William.</p>

<p>'Why?'</p>

<p>'She finally saw what I was really like.'</p>

<p>'Oh. That's not good.'</p>

<p>They could hear loud conversation from a table just around the corner from theirs.</p>

<p>'No, no, no. I'll take Anna Scott,' said a man's voice.</p>

<p>William and Anna listened carefully.</p>

<p>A second man disagreed. 'I didn't like her last film. I fell asleep ten minutes after it started.'</p>

<p>The first man spoke again. 'I don't really mind what the films are like. I just like watching her.'</p>

<p>'No, she's not my type. I prefer the other one. The one who gets excited every time you take her out for a cup of coffee.'</p>

<p>Anna looked at William. 'Meg Ryan,' she mouthed silently.</p>

<p>'You know,' said the first voice again, 'some girls don't let you near them. But Anna isn't like that. You know she wants it. She's the same as all actresses. Someone you can just&#160;...'</p>

<p>Anna's smile disappeared.</p>

<p>'Right, that's enough,' William said, standing up. He walked over to the men's table. There were four of them.</p>

<p>'I'm sorry, but&#160;...'</p>

<p>'Can I help you?' one of the men said politely.</p>

<p>'Well, I was listening to your conversation&#151;I couldn't help it. But you know, you're talking about a real person. And you shouldn't talk about her like that&#160;...'</p>

<p>'Oh, go away. Who are you&#151;her father?' The men laughed loudly.</p>

<p>Anna came up behind William and pulled him away. The men at the table didn't see her face and continued laughing.</p>

<p>'I'm sorry,' William said to her.</p>

<p>'It's OK. I love the fact you tried.' They started walking towards the door of the restaurant. Then Anna stopped. 'No, give me a minute.' And she walked back to the men's table.</p>

<p>'Hi!' She smiled sweetly. 'I'm sorry about my friend.'</p>

<p>'Oh ...' said the man who was doing most of the talking. He knew her face immediately. 'Listen, I'm sorry.'</p>

<p>'Please, please,' she said. 'Stop there. I'm sure it was all just friendly talk. It didn't mean anything. And I'm sure you can't help being stupid. Enjoy your meal. The fish is really good.'</p>

<p>She walked back to William, still smiling. The men sat in silence, their mouths hanging open.</p>

<p>Outside the restaurant Anna said, 'Why did I do that?'</p>

<p>'It was wonderful.'</p>

<p>'No, I'm stupid and&#160;... What am I doing with you?'</p>

<p>'I don't know, I'm afraid,' he replied, smiling.</p>

<p>'I don't know, either,' she said softly.</p>

<p>They arrived at the front door of the Ritz.</p>

<p>'Do you want to come up?' she asked quietly.</p>

<p>'There seem to be lots of reasons why I shouldn't.'</p>

<p>'There are lots of reasons. But do you want to come up?'</p>

<p>His look said yes.</p>

<p>'Give me five minutes,' she smiled, and walked towards the lift.</p>

<p>For William, time seemed to pass very slowly. The hands on his watch refused to move.</p>

<p>Exactly five minutes later, he knocked at the door of her room. She opened it. 'Hi.' Something seemed to be wrong.</p>

<p>'Hi,' said William, kissing her. 'It's wonderful to be able to do that.'</p>

<p>Anna's eyes were wide and there was a very serious look on her face. 'You have to go,' she whispered.</p>

<p>'Why?'</p>

<p>'My boyfriend. I thought he was in America. But in fact, he's in the next room.'</p>

<p>'Your boyfriend?' William couldn't believe it.</p>

<p>'Who is it?' The man was standing in the doorway, behind Anna, now. Jeff was a famous film star. Handsome, too&#151;women all over the world dreamt about him.</p>

<p>William thought quickly. 'Room service.'</p>

<p>'How are you doing? I thought you people always wore suits?' Jeff said in a friendly way.</p>

<p>'Well, yes&#160;... but I've just changed because I'm going home. This is my last call.'</p>

<p>'Oh, great. Could I have some really cold water up here?'</p>

<p>'I'll see what I can do.'</p>

<p>'And maybe you could clear these dirty plates while you're here?'</p>

<p>William calmly picked up the dirty plates.</p>

<p>'Really, don't do that,' Anna said nervously. 'I'm sure that's not his job,' she told Jeff.</p>

<p>'Is there a problem?' Jeff asked William.</p>

<p>'No, no. It's fine.'</p>

<p>'What's your name?' he asked 'It's&#160;... er&#160;... Bernie.'</p>

<p>'Well, thank you, Bernie,' he said, pushing five pounds into William's hand. Jeff turned to Anna. 'Hey! Good surprise or bad surprise?'</p>

<p>Anna looked uncomfortable. 'Nice surprise.'</p>

<p>Jeff kissed her.</p>

<p>'She's lying,' he said to William. 'She hates surprises.' He turned to Anna. 'So what food are you ordering?'</p>

<p>'I haven't decided.'</p>

<p>'Well, don't order too much. I don't want people saying, "There goes that famous actor with the big, fat girlfriend,"' Jeff laughed, leaving the room.</p>

<p>William looked at Anna. 'I think I should leave. This is all very strange. I didn't realize&#160;...'</p>

<p>'I'm so sorry. I don't know what to say.'</p>

<p>'I think "goodbye" is probably the right word.'</p>

<p>William walked downstairs and out into the lonely night. His heart ached.</p>
