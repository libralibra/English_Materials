<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER TWO</p>

<p class="centeredBold">First Kiss&#151;Last Kiss?</p>

<p>William felt empty. 'That's it, then. She's gone. And I'll probably never see her again,' he thought to himself.</p>

<p>'Here's your coffee,' Martin said brightly, as he came back into the shop.</p>

<p>'Thanks. You won't believe who was in here a minute ago.'</p>

<p>'Who? Somebody famous?' Martin asked, excited.</p>

<p>But William suddenly changed his mind. 'Oh&#160;... er&#160;... no&#160;... nobody.'</p>

<p>'Perhaps one day a famous person will come in!' said Martin, his eyes shining. 'I saw one of the Beatles once&#160;... Ringo Starr. Well, I think it was Ringo Starr. I'm not really sure&#160;... he was quite far away. He had long hair and a beard.'</p>

<p>'Hmmm&#160;... so you think you saw Ringo, but perhaps you didn't?'</p>

<p>'Er&#160;... yes, that's right.'</p>

<p>'Maybe it was just a man with long hair and a beard?'</p>

<p>'Yes, maybe.'</p>

<p>'Not a very good story, then, is it?' suggested William. He shook his head and finished his coffee. 'Right&#160;... another one?'</p>

<p>'Yes. No, let's go crazy! I'll have an orange juice.'</p>

<p>Five minutes later, William left the cafe and hurried back to the bookshop with the orange juice. But as he turned the corner, he walked straight into a woman. The orange juice ran down her shirt.</p>

<p>'I'm so sorry&#160;...' He looked up at the woman's face. For the second time that day, it was Anna Scott! 'Oh&#160;... really, I'm sorry. Here&#160;...'</p>

<p>'What are you doing?' Anna shouted angrily, as William tried to clean her shirt with a paper towel.</p>

<p>William jumped back. 'Nothing, nothing. Listen, I live across the street. You can wash at my house.'</p>

<p>'No, thank you. I just need to call my driver.' She turned away.</p>

<p>'I also have a phone. In five minutes, you can be clean and back on the street again&#160;...</p>

<p>She turned and looked at him. 'OK. What does across the street mean? How far is your house exactly?'</p>

<p>William pointed. 'It's just there. That's my house. The one with the blue door.'</p>

<p>She looked down at her shirt. Then she looked back up at him. 'Well, OK.'</p>

<p>They walked towards William's house. He opened the door.</p>

<p>'Come in. I'll just&#160;...'</p>

<p>The house was in a terrible mess. William ran inside in front of her and kicked some shoes under the stairs. He threw away an old pizza and tried to hide some dirty plates.</p>

<p>'I'm afraid it's a bit untidy.'</p>

<p>Anna looked around. Her face showed nothing. Taking the bag of books from her, William pointed towards the stairs.</p>

<p>'The bathroom's up there and there's a phone on the desk in the room next to it.'</p>

<p>She took her other bags and walked upstairs. William ran around the ground floor, clearing the mess.</p>

<p>'Anna Scott is in my house! She's in my bathroom! And look at this place! I'll kill Spike,' he thought.</p>

<p>He heard Anna's feet on the stairs and looked up. She was wearing different clothes now&#151;a black top and skirt. Without the dark glasses, her deep brown eyes shone. She looked wonderful. William stopped and stared. He tried to think of something to say.</p>

<p>'Tea&#160;... Would you like a cup of tea before you go?'</p>

<p>'No, thanks.'</p>

<p>'Coffee?'</p>

<p>'No.'</p>

<p>'Something cold? Orange juice? No, probably not. Water?'</p>

<p>'Really, no.'</p>

<p>'Something to eat&#160;... some fruit?'</p>

<p>'No.'</p>

<p>'Do you always say no to everything?'</p>

<p>Anna looked amused. 'No. I must go,' she said. 'Thanks for your help.'</p>

<p>'You're welcome.' He wanted to say more, but he couldn't find the words. 'And I'd like to say&#160;...' he continued, finally, 'you're wonderful. It's my one chance to say it. When you've read that terrible book, you'll never visit my shop again.'</p>

<p>She looked pleased. 'Thank you.'</p>

<p>William walked her to the front door. 'Nice to meet you. Strange, but nice.'</p>

<p>Anna left, and he closed the door behind her.</p>

<p>'Oh, no!' he thought. '"Strange, but nice"! What was I thinking?'</p>

<p>There was a knock on the door. It was Anna again.</p>

<p>'Oh, hi. Did you forget something?'</p>

<p>'I forgot my books,' said Anna, stepping quickly inside the house.</p>

<p>'Oh, right.'</p>

<p>William ran into the kitchen to get the bag. 'Here they are.'</p>

<p>'Thanks. Well&#160;...'</p>

<p>They stood near the door again. This time, William felt more comfortable. Then Anna moved forward and kissed him. He could smell her hair; he could feel the smoothness of her skin against his. He couldn't believe it. Anna Scott, the woman of his dreams, was here, in his house, kissing him, William Thacker.</p>

<p>At the worst possible time, a key turned in the lock.</p>

<p>'Oh, no. It's my lodger, Spike! I'm sorry. There's no excuse for him.'</p>

<p>Spike walked in and straight past them towards the kitchen. 'I'm going to get some food,' he called over his shoulder. 'Then I'm going to tell you a story that you won't believe&#160;...'</p>

<p>Anna looked at William. 'You won't tell anyone about this, will you?'</p>

<p>'Right. No one. I mean, I'll tell myself sometimes. But don't worry&#160;... I won't believe it.'</p>

<p>He opened the door for her a second time.</p>

<p>'Bye.' She touched his hand lightly. And then she was gone.</p>

<p>William walked slowly back into the kitchen.</p>

<p>'Shall we watch videos tonight? I've got some really great films,' Spike said, between mouthfuls of food.</p>

<p>'Yes,' thought William sadly. 'I've got nothing better to do with my life.'</p>

<p>One of Spike's videos was a film starring Anna Scott. Later that evening, as the two men sat in front of the TV, William remembered the touch of her hand, the smell of her hair.</p>

<p>Spike shook his head at the screen. 'It's hard to believe. Somewhere there's a man who can kiss Anna Scott&#151;anytime, anywhere.'</p>

<p>'Yes, she's quite wonderful.'</p>
