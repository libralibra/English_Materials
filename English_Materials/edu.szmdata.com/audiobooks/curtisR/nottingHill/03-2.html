<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER THREE</p>

<p class="centeredBold">Call Me!</p>

<p>A customer came into the bookshop the next morning. William knew Mr Smith well.</p>

<p>'Have you got any books by Dickens?' Mr Smith asked.</p>

<p>William sighed. Not again. 'No,' he said slowly and patiently, 'this is a travel bookshop. We only sell travel books.'</p>

<p>'Oh. And that new John Grisham book?'</p>

<p>'No, John Grisham doesn't write travel books either.'</p>

<p>'Oh, right. Have you got a copy of Romeo and Juliet?' William looked at Mr Smith, then shouted, 'Martin, your customer!'</p>

<p>Martin came out from behind some shelves with a warm smile on his face. 'Can I help you?' he asked Mr Smith.</p>

<p>As William stared sadly out of the window, a bus went past the shop. On the side was a large picture of Anna in her new film, Helix. He couldn't stop thinking about her.</p>

<p>A few days later, William walked into his kitchen.</p>

<p>'Hi, Spike.'</p>

<p>'Hi.'</p>

<p>Spike was never Britain's best-dressed man, but today his clothes were even stranger than usual. He was wearing William's scuba diving suit, with a pair of goggles on his head.</p>

<p>'Er&#160;... Spike? Why are you wearing my scuba diving suit?'</p>

<p>'No clean clothes.'</p>

<p>'There never will be if you don't wash them sometimes,' William suggested.</p>

<p>'And I was looking around your room and I found this. Great, isn't it? I think I look good in it, eh?'</p>

<p>It was a lovely day and they went outside into the sunshine. Spike, still in the scuba diving suit, tried unsuccessfully to read his newspaper through the goggles.</p>

<p>'There's something wrong with these, William,' he said, pointing to the goggles.</p>

<p>'That's because they were made specially for my eyes. So I can see the fish.'</p>

<p>'Oh, right.'</p>

<p>'So&#160;... any messages for me?' William asked.</p>

<p>'Yes, I wrote down two.'</p>

<p>'Two. Were there only two messages?'</p>

<p>'You want me to write down all of them?'</p>

<p>William closed his eyes and sighed. 'The ones you didn't write down&#160;... Who were they from?'</p>

<p>'Mmmm&#160;... Was there one&#160;...? No, it's gone. I just can't remember anything about them. Oh no, wait! Your mother's leg is hurting her again. And don't forget lunch on Saturday.'</p>

<p>'Any others?' asked William hopefully.</p>

<p>'No, that's it. No others.' Spike sat back in his chair and closed his eyes. Then he seemed to remember something. 'Ah&#160;... but if you want all your messages, there was one from an American girl a few days ago. Anna, I think she said.'</p>

<p>William's heart stopped. 'What did she say?'</p>

<p>'Well, it was a bit strange. She said, "Hi, it's Anna." And then she said, "Call me at the Ritz." And then she gave a different name.'</p>

<p>'What was the name?'</p>

<p>'No idea. One name's difficult enough to remember, but two&#160;...'</p>

<p>William ran inside.</p>

<p>'Hello, is that the Ritz Hotel?' he said, when a man answered the phone.</p>

<p>'Can I help you, sir?'</p>

<p>'Er&#160;... I hope you can. I'm a friend of Anna Scott. She left me a message. She's staying with you. She asked me to call her.'</p>

<p>'I'm sorry, sir. We have nobody here of that name.'</p>

<p>'No, that's right&#160;... I know that. She's using another name. She left a message with my lodger&#151;a bad mistake. Think of the stupidest person you know&#160;... well, my lodger's even worse. He's so stupid&#160;...'</p>

<p>'Try "Flintstone".'</p>

<p>William looked up from the phone and turned towards Spike.</p>

<p>'What?'</p>

<p>'Try "Flintstone",' Spike repeated.</p>

<p>William spoke slowly into the phone. 'Is it possible that Flintstone means anything to you?'</p>

<p>'I'll put you through, sir.'</p>

<p>William could hear another phone ringing. He tried to stay calm.</p>

<p>'What shall I say?' he thought to himself. He practised a few words. 'Hi. Hi. Anna. Hi.' And then he heard her voice.</p>

<p>'Hi.'</p>

<p>'Oh&#160;... hi. It's William Thacker. We&#160;... er&#160;... I work in a bookshop. You called me&#160;...'</p>

<p>'Well, yes. Three days ago.'</p>

<p>'I'm so sorry. You probably think&#160;... It was a mistake. My stupid lodger, Spike, took the message. And he didn't give it to me until now.'</p>

<p>'Oh, OK,' she said slowly.</p>

<p>'Perhaps I could come to the Ritz for&#160;... tea, or something?'</p>

<p>'Yes, but I'm a little busy today&#160;...' She was silent for a minute. 'But let's try. Four o'clock.'</p>

<p>'Right, great.' William put down the phone. 'Wonderful.'</p>
