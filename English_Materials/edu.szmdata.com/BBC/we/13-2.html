	<tr><td class="roles">Ceilia: </td><td>Oh dear, oh dear.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Mary: </td><td>Problem Ceilia?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Ceilia: </td><td>Well according to my calculations, in the past two months we've only had 22 customers. I'm not sure we can afford to stay in business.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Gordon: </td><td>Well you gave it your best shot but maybe it's time to say enough is enough – and give up. No doubt I'll get a new job at some high-class restaurant.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Ceilia: </td><td>Oh be quiet Gordon and let me think.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Gordon: </td><td>I knew she couldn't cope. She calls herself a business woman but really I'm the brains behind this business.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Mary: </td><td>Really?! Actually, I think she's a tough cookie – and she doesn't strike me as the sort of person to give up easily.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Gordon: </td><td>Ha! Don't forget I used to be married to her. You might seem as tough as old boots but she wouldn't say boo to a goose. She's as soft as a little kitten ... </td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Ceilia: </td><td>Excuse me ... you're the one who cried all the way through the royal wedding on TV! Believe me Gordon, I'm a game old bird and I've decided to make some changes.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Gordon: </td><td>Oh ... right Ceilia. Let's hear them then.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Ceilia: </td><td>Right. Well firstly, I think we ought to extend the menu and offer more choices.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Gordon: </td><td>That's impossible.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Ceilia: </td><td>Well maybe for you ... perhaps we ought to think about staffing then?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Gordon: </td><td>You're relentless.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Mary: </td><td>And what is the second point Ceilia?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Ceilia: </td><td>Well secondly, I think we ought to open earlier and try to get more customers in for lunchtime.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Gordon: </td><td>Working longer hours you mean!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Ceilia: </td><td>Well tough luck Gordon. You might think that I'm as gentle as a kitten but I'm as hard as nails and believe me I'm not going to give up on this business yet. So go on, think of something new for the menu.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Mary: </td><td>Aww, tough love Gordon! Do you want the recipe book?</td></tr>
