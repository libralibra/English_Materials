<table border="0">
	<tr><td class="roles">Ceilia: </td><td>So I was at the bus stop but then I decided to walk, but these shoes - they're just not designed for ... oh, what's this?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Mary: </td><td>Goodness. It looks like Gordon has finally pulled out all of the stops and actually made something amazing!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Ceilia: </td><td>It must be the bake-off competition - always makes an effort when there's something to win! The first prize is £500.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Mary: </td><td>Hi Gordon. Fantastic cake.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Gordon: </td><td>Cake? What cake?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Mary: </td><td>This one. Did you make it for the competition?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Ceilia: </td><td>The bake-off. The first prize is £500.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Gordon: </td><td>Oh ... the competition ... yes, that's my cake. It's rather good isn't it? Yes, I think the attention to detail will put me ahead of the game.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Ceilia: </td><td>It is amazing how much effort you can put in when there's big money up for grabs.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Gordon: </td><td>It's not about the money, Ceilia, but this should really blow the competition away.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Mary: </td><td>But don't forget you'll be in competition with some of the best bakers in the business.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Gordon: </td><td>Don't worry about that. I had better just go and put this in a box so we can send it off to the judges - we don't want to miss the deadline.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Mary: </td><td>May the best man win!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Peter: </td><td>Best man? Is someone getting married?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Mary: </td><td>No, I was just wishing him luck for the bake-off competition.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Peter: </td><td>Oh is he entering too? I've been baking all night to make a cake for the competition. I put it over ... here. Has anyone seen my cake?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Ceilia: </td><td>Was it a chocolate cake with a cream top?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Peter: </td><td>Yes!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Mary: </td><td>Gordon, I think you've got Peter's cake.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Gordon: </td><td>Yes ... I was going to help him deliver it. There you go Peter, and - nice cake, probably needs a little bit more cream.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Peter: </td><td>Thank you.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Ceilia: </td><td>You win some, you lose some. And this time you definitely lost!</td></tr>
