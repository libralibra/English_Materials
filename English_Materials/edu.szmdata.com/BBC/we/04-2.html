	<tr><td class="roles">Gordon: </td><td>From the supermarket!!! Don't make my blood boil more than it already is. Do you think world-class chefs buy ready meals from the supermarket? Honestly!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Mary: </td><td>OK, don't blow your top. When I was young my mum would add a spoonful of mustard into all her cooking and it made everything taste so nice. Now, why not give that a go?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Ceilia: </td><td>Go on Gordon, give that a go, and maybe it will stop you getting so hot under the collar.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Gordon: </td><td>Very well. Hmm, doesn't taste bad. I think I've created something good here.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Peter: </td><td>Well done Mary - we should name the dish 'The Mary Miracle Meal' after you!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Gordon: </td><td>No, I don't think so. We'll call it 'Gordon's Greatest Goulash'.</td></tr>
