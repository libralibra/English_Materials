<table border="0">
	<tr><td class="roles">Ceilia: </td><td>Listen everyone. I've just heard on the radio, the police are looking for a criminal who was last seen in this area. We need to keep an eye out for him.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Peter: </td><td>Oh no - you don't think he might come here do you?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Gordon: </td><td>Oh yes, no doubt he'll have a three-course meal while he waits for the police to catch him.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Mary: </td><td>Not if he's eating your cooking Gordon. Anyway Ceilia, what does he look like?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Ceilia: </td><td>Well, the police say he's about Gordon's height, he's got a slightly reddish face and is wearing a silly hat ... </td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Gordon: </td><td>Well, don't all look at me.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Ceilia: </td><td> ... and he's got glasses and he also has a moustache.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Gordon: </td><td>A moustache! Sounds like a proper criminal ... he no doubt slits the throats of his victims ... killed his mother ... and doesn't pay his taxes. When I see him I'll make sure he gets his comeuppance.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Ceilia: </td><td>You're all mouth and no trousers Gordon. Anyway, everyone back to work and remember we need to keep an eye out for him.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Mary: </td><td>Are you a bit nervous Gordon?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Gordon: </td><td>No. I've had to deal with customers that are worse than criminals.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Peter: </td><td>The ... the ... the man ... I think he's out there ... table 3.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Mary: </td><td>OK, stay calm. Peter, go get Ceilia. Gordon ... go and see if he's out there. Come on - are you a man or a mouse?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Gordon: </td><td>He might have a knife or a gun ... he could be dangerous ... </td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Mary: </td><td>Come on ... what are you made of? I thought you were my knight in shining armour!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Ceilia: </td><td>I'll see if it's him. False alarm! It's not him!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Gordon: </td><td>Right, I'm going out there. How dare we have customers in here trying to look like dangerous criminals ... I was that close to handing him over to the police.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Ceilia: </td><td>Don't bother. When did I say he was a dangerous criminal? The police are looking for a thief who was shoplifting.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Mary: </td><td>Hmmm, I think it's safer if you stay in the kitchen Gordon!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Ceilia: </td><td>Is that wise? It's his cooking that's criminal!</td></tr>
