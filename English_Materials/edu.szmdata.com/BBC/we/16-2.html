	<tr><td class="roles">Ceilia: </td><td>Well that's good news isn't it? How many are coming?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Peter: </td><td>Twenty-five! In a bus! In one hour!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Gordon: </td><td>That's impossible. How can I cook for 25 people? I do quality, not quantity.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Ceilia: </td><td>Keep your cool, Gordon. This is our big moment.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Gordon: </td><td>Our big moment? It'll be our big failure. Why did you say 'yes' Peter?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Mary: </td><td>Stay calm! We can do this but you're going to need to let me help you. I'll chop some vegetables and prepare some starters.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Peter: </td><td>But how I am going to write down 25 orders? I've only got a small pad.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Ceilia: </td><td>Well done Mary. See, she's got it all under control.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Gordon: </td><td>Under control! Chopping some carrots will not feed 25 people!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Mary: </td><td>My advice Gordon is to act cool and collected and everything will be ok.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">&#160;</td><td>[<i>Phone rings again.</i>]</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Gordon: </td><td>Somebody answer that phone, I'm going to get some onions.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Peter: </td><td>I'm on it. "Hello ... The White Elephant ... oh yes ... yes ... I see ... I hope you get it fixed ... thanks for letting us know. Bye". That was people from the bus ... they've broken down and won't be able to come tonight.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Mary: </td><td>Oh no, that's a shame. We'd better tell Gordon before he blows a gasket!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Ceilia: </td><td>Hmmm ... let's not tell him straight away!</td></tr>
