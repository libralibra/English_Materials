	<tr><td class="roles">Ceilia: </td><td>How are you today, Peter?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Peter: </td><td>Very good thank you ... Actually not very good – thank you for asking.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Ceilia: </td><td>Why? What's the matter?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Peter: </td><td>Last night, I was walking home when I crossed the road and I was almost hit by a burger van.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Mary: </td><td>Oh no, Peter, that's terrible. Are you OK?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Peter: </td><td>Just a bit shaken. He was going so fast!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Ceilia: </td><td>Why don't you come and sit down in the office until you feel a bit better.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Peter: </td><td>OK</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Gordon: </td><td>Sorry I'm late – I had some extra-curricular activities. To be honest, I overslept – I've been working late doing another job.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Mary: </td><td>You're moonlighting Gordon? Do you really need a second job?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Gordon: </td><td>This is not any old job, sweetheart – this is an opportunity to manage a high-class American-themed restaurant. This is my future!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Mary: </td><td>Are you sure?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Gordon: </td><td>God's honest truth!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Mary: </td><td>Hmm really. Look, I think you should tell Ceilia – to avoid any problems – honesty is the best policy.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Gordon: </td><td>No no, I don't think we should tell her. Let's keep it our little secret. Anyway, I don't want her thinking I'm just working here out of sympathy.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Mary: </td><td>No, of course not. Anyway, where is this 'high-class' restaurant?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Gordon: </td><td>Oh, well, you wouldn't know where it is.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Mary: </td><td>Try me.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Gordon: </td><td>Well, it's currently parked ... I mean located ... on Canal Street, near the park.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Peter: </td><td>That's where I was almost hit by that burger van. Look, I've got a photo of the van on my phone.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Ceilia: </td><td>That's strange – that van's parked outside our restaurant. Maybe I ought to call the police?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Gordon: </td><td>Let's not be too hasty. I'm sure there's a simple explanation.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Mary: </td><td>Yes ... I think there might be. Gordon, you may as well come clean. This high-class restaurant you're managing – it's a burger van, isn't it?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Ceilia: </td><td>What's that Gordon? Flipping burgers in your spare time? How would you like to flip burgers full-time instead of working here?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Gordon: </td><td>Let's not be too hasty. I'm just trying to make an honest living.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Ceilia: </td><td>Well, if you're a decent and honest man, why don't you compensate Peter for the stress that you've caused him?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Peter: </td><td>Thank you!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Mary: </td><td>Now everything is open and above board – perhaps we could book a table at your 'restaurant' tonight?!</td></tr>
