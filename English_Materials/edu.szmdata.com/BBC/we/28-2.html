<p class="storyTitle">The White Elephant 28: Empathy</p>
<table border="0">
	<tr><td class="roles">Ceilia: </td><td>Thanks for your attention everyone. Now, as you know, I attended a conference yesterday and one of the great ideas I learnt was giving members of staff the opportunity to experience what other members of staff do.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Mary: </td><td>You mean a job swap?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Gordon: </td><td>So one of you lot is going to try doing my job?! Impossible!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Ceilia: </td><td>I want you to see what it feels like to be in someone else's shoes.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Peter: </td><td>But I wouldn't fit in your shoes.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Ceilia: </td><td>Not literally Peter. It's just to understand what other people do – I'll take your job and you can take mine. And Mary and Gordon you can swap jobs too. Now, I'll take some orders – can I have your notepad please Peter?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Gordon: </td><td>Oh very well ... actually, from where I'm standing, it seems like I've got the easy job!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Mary: </td><td>We'll see about that.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Peter: </td><td>So everyone back to work please. Come on Gordon, we need all these plates washed.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Ceilia: </td><td>I have an order - Four Seasons Vegetable Ragout for two people.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Mary: </td><td>OK, coming right up. Gordon – I'll need some large bowls washing ... and I'll need that pan ... come on, quick as you can.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Gordon: </td><td>I hear you! I just can't believe I've got to do all this.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Peter: </td><td>Well done Mary ... you're doing a great job.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Gordon: </td><td>Actually ... can you spare me a thought ... I've got to do all this.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Peter: </td><td>Hmm, I can see where you're coming from. You can't cope ... you're fired. Off you go.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Gordon: </td><td>You can't do that!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Mary: </td><td>Peter! Take some pity on him – he's after all only a washer-upper!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Ceilia: </td><td>So how's the job swap going?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Gordon: </td><td>He's sacked me!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Ceilia: </td><td>Well done. I've been trying to do that for months! How's it going for you Mary?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Mary: </td><td>It's all fine. All the food's ready to go. I don't know why Gordon makes such a fuss about cooking!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Ceilia: </td><td>Nor do I. But you see in my job, I have to show empathy for people. So Gordon – you can stay ... for now.</td></tr>
