	<tr><td class="roles">Peter: </td><td>It's quiet tonight.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Mary: </td><td>I know. It's a bit of a worry - Ceilia said tonight was our last hope. If we don't get any customers we might have to close.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Gordon: </td><td>Well, don't get your hopes up. This place has been on its knees ever since it opened. We've all had a laugh but I need to get a job at a proper restaurant, where the customers are queuing up to eat my food.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Mary: </td><td>Don't pin your hopes on it. It was your cooking that scared the customers away anyway. Hang on, did I just hear somebody come in?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Peter: </td><td>I'll go and check.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Gordon: </td><td>To be honest, I might be able to take you with me, to my new job - but Peter - not a chance.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Mary: </td><td>I can only live in hope!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Peter: </td><td>Yes, we've got two customers! And they want ... a cheese and tomato pizza. Can we do pizzas?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Gordon: </td><td>Can we do pizzas? Not a hope in hell! Do I look like a chef who cooks 'pizzas'?!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Mary: </td><td>Come on Gordon. We're pinning our hopes on keeping these customers ... you do know how to cook a pizza don't you?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Gordon: </td><td>Yes ... well ... it's just a little bit beneath me ... but I suppose I can give it a go.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Mary: </td><td>Good. I'll tell Ceilia the good news.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Gordon: </td><td>Peter. Here's Â£10 - run to the supermarket and buy some frozen pizzas. But shhh, it's our little secret.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Peter: </td><td>OK.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">&#160;</td><td><i>10 MINUTES LATER.</i></td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Ceilia: </td><td>Mmmm, something smells good. Great news about getting all the customers in - even though they only like pizza! It seems like there's a glimmer of hope for the business.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Ceilia: </td><td>Looking good. Maybe pizzas are our future?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Peter: </td><td>Yes, they're not bad for frozen pizzas are they?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Ceilia: </td><td>Frozen?! Oh you've dashed my hopes. This is the last straw ... I'm going to have to find a real chef ... and not one that is as arrogant as you!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Gordon: </td><td>But what am I going to do? I can't just get a new job just like that.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Ceilia: </td><td>There might not be hope for you but I think I might have the perfect answer.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">&#160;</td><td><i>LATER ... </i></td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Mary: </td><td>How's your new job Gordon? Can I borrow your hat? Thank you!</td></tr>
