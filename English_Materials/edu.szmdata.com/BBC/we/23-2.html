<table border="0">
	<tr><td class="roles">Mary: </td><td>Phew, what a night!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Peter: </td><td>Yes, amazing. I've never done anything like that before.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Mary: </td><td>Nor I. My first ever awards ceremony.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Peter: </td><td>I didn't sleep a wink when I got home. I was still buzzing from meeting all those celebrity chefs.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Gordon: </td><td>'Didn't sleep a wink' did you say Peter? I slept like a log – celebrity chefs don't excite me. They may be famous but can they cook?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Mary: </td><td>Well, they certainly win a lot of awards.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Peter: </td><td>Yes – The Poison Ivy won 'Restaurant of the Year' – it's a shame we didn't win any awards though.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Gordon: </td><td>Yes, well I wouldn't lose too much sleep over it – what is an award anyway but just a piece of metal that sits on the shelf gathering dust. A real award is a customer thanking me for an excellent meal.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Peter: </td><td>Really? I thought you said getting an award would be the highlight of your career?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Mary: </td><td>Peter, I think it's best if we let sleeping dogs lie – you know how sensitive he is.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Gordon: </td><td>Now where's my sleeping partner?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Ceilia: </td><td>I hope you didn't mean me – I'm the only boss here. Sorry I'm late, I had a bit too much champagne last night - but at least I slept like a baby.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Mary: </td><td>Lucky you. Peter and I may need a catnap later!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Gordon: </td><td>You've got no stamina – honestly! You two left earlier than me.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Mary: </td><td>Well, that's because you kept putting your arm around me.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Ceilia: </td><td>Did he indeed?! Well, after that woman on the dance floor slapped you round the face and youleft ... the judges gave out another award.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Gordon: </td><td>Another award – really?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Ceilia: </td><td>Yes – and guess what? We won it!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Gordon: </td><td>At last – some recognition – my true talents are there in writing to be seen – come on then Peter, what does it say?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Peter: </td><td>'Gordon Grater – Most Arrogant Chef' – oh, congratulations!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Mary: </td><td>Oh Gordon – it looks like you need some beauty sleep!</td></tr>
