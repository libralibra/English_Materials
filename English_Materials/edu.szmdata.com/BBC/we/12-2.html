<table border="0">
	<tr><td class="roles">Ceilia: </td><td>Thanks for coming in earlier than normal. I wanted to give the kitchen a good spring clean. Hopefully the others will be here soon to help.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Mary: </td><td>No problem - although it was a bit of a shock to the system getting up this early!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Ceilia: </td><td>What on earth was that?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Mary: </td><td>I heard it too. Hang on, I'm just going to go and put the lights on. Oh, it's Gordon! He gave me the shock of my life.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Ceilia: </td><td>Gordon? What's he doing sleeping here in the kitchen?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Gordon: </td><td>Oh ... err ... hello Ceilia, hello Mary. I was just err ... </td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Mary: </td><td> ... sleeping on the floor. Gordon, you made me jump out of my skin.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Gordon: </td><td>Sorry about that. I was just checking the ... cooker connections.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Ceilia: </td><td>Sleeping more like. The last time I saw you looking this bad was when you came back drunk from that party and I kicked you out.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Gordon: </td><td>Well ... errr ... I've been kicked out again. It happened out of the blue. I came home last night and my girlfriend ... my new girlfriend ... my new ex-girlfriend, she said she was sick of me coming home late and stinking of fried food.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Mary: </td><td>Yes, so I can smell.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Ceilia: </td><td>Gordon, I'm stunned. I thought your girlfriend had no taste but now I can see she has!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Peter: </td><td>Sorry I'm late. Oh, what's that smell?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Mary: </td><td>It's Gordon. He's been kicked out of his house and he's been sleeping here. Hang on a minute Peter - don't you have space at your house?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Peter: </td><td>Yes I have.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Mary: </td><td>Could Gordon stay with you until he sorts himself out?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Peter: </td><td>What a great idea Mary. I'd love a bit of company. You can sleep on the sofa. Is that OK?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Ceilia: </td><td>That's great! Gordon the great chef sleeping on the sofa of the little waiter. Sounds perfect! But you're going to have to get some earplugs, Peter.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Peter: </td><td>Why?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Ceilia: </td><td>Well - he snores!</td></tr>
