<p class="FMH1">Unit 17: Buying things</p>

<p class="FMH3">1. In a lost property office.</p>
		<table border="0">
			<tr><td class="roles">Francis</td><td>Hello. Excuse me. Good morning. Can I help you?</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Mrs.&#160;Smith</td><td>Yes. I lost my umbrella. I lost it yesterday.</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Francis</td><td>I think this is your umbrella.</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Mrs.&#160;Smith</td><td>Oh, yes. Thank you very much. Goodbye.</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Francis</td><td>That's Mrs. Smith. She loses her umbrella every week. And last week she lost a bag, too. Some people lose things every day. Mr. Johnson for example. Yes. There he is. He's buying a present for his wife. But he'll lose it. He always loses things.</td></tr>
		</table>

<p class="FMH3">2. How much does it cost?</p>
		<table border="0">
			<tr><td class="roles">Salesgirl</td><td>Good morning, sir. Can I help you?</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Mr.&#160;Johnson</td><td>Yes. I'm looking for a present, for my wife.</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Salesgirl</td><td>This handbag is very nice, sir.</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Mr.&#160;Johnson</td><td>Is it expensive?</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Salesgirl</td><td>Oh, no, sir. It's quite cheap. It costs fifteen pounds.</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Mr.&#160;Johnson</td><td>Fifteen pounds? That's too expensive, I'm afraid.</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Salesgirl</td><td>Look at this vase, sir.</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Mr.&#160;Johnson</td><td>No. That one's too big. What about the one next to it?</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Salesgirl</td><td>Ah, yes, sir. This one is smaller. And it's cheaper.</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Mr.&#160;Johnson</td><td>How much does it cost?</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Salesgirl</td><td>Eleven pounds thirty pence.</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Mr.&#160;Johnson</td><td>Eleven pounds thirty? It's too expensive and it's too heavy.</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Salesgirl</td><td>What about one of these?</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Mr.&#160;Johnson</td><td>How much is it? How much does it cost?</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Salesgirl</td><td>Eight pounds fifty. It costs eight pounds fifty.</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Mr.&#160;Johnson</td><td>It's too expensive.</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Salesgirl</td><td>This is cheaper. It's four pounds fifty. And these are very cheap. They're four pounds.</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Mr.&#160;Johnson</td><td>I'll take the big brown one. My wife will like that. She likes bears. I'll buy that one.</td></tr>
		</table>

<p class="FMH3">3. What's it made of?</p>
		<table border="0">
			<tr><td class="roles">Customer</td><td>How much is this hat?</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Salesman</td><td>Fifty pounds, madam.</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Customer</td><td>That's expensive. What's it made of?</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Salesman</td><td>It's made of real fur. It's a very good hat. Those hats are cheaper. This one here, twelve pounds. Who is it for?</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Customer</td><td>It's for my husband.</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Salesman</td><td>It's probably too small for your husband. It isn't big enough. It's size 5. Now, this one is bigger.</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Customer</td><td>What size is it?</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Salesman</td><td>It's size 7. Is that big enough for your husband?</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Customer</td><td>Yes, it's big enough. It's the right size for my husband. What's it made of?</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Salesman</td><td>It's made of wool. And it costs ten pounds.</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Customer</td><td>What do you think of it?</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Salesman</td><td>Well, it looks very nice on you, madam. But will your husband like it?</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Customer</td><td>Perhaps not. It's the right size and it's not too expensive. But my husband prefers very dark colours.</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Salesman</td><td>Ah. The fur hat is dark, madam, and it's the right size. There, what do you think of it that?</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Customer</td><td>It's very nice. I'll buy it.</td></tr>
