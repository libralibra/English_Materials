<p class="FMH3">1. I'm sure you all enjoy it very much.</p>
<p class="z">(<i>It's at a meeting in a club. Mr. and Mrs. Sellers are giving lectures with 534pictures about their holiday in Spain last year</i>.)</p>

			<tr><td class="roles">ChairWoman</td><td>And now, ladies and gentlemen, Mr. and Mrs. Sellers are going to give us a talk— with pictures—about&#160;...&#160;</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Mrs.&#160;Sellers</td><td>534 pictures.</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">ChairWoman</td><td>Sorry?</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Mrs.&#160;Sellers</td><td>With 534 pictures of our holiday.</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">ChairWoman</td><td>Good heavens! With, er, 534 pictures, about their holiday in Spain last year. Mr. and Mrs. Sellers.</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Mr.&#160;Sellers</td><td>Thank you, and good evening. This is the story of a holiday in Spain, which my dear wife and I had last year. I hope you'll enjoy it as much as we did. Lights, please. Thank you. Ah! This is the beginning of our holiday, at our local airport — Gatwick. That's the bookings desk. The Departures Board. And the Arrivals Board. And this is my dear wife at the check-in counter. She is — er — checking in. This is the security control at the airport. They're checking hand luggage. Here the man is checking my wife's passport. And here is my dear wife in the departure lounge. This is my dear wife going into the duty-free shop at Gatwick Airport. And this is — you know who — going through the departure gate. We went through the departure gate at 17:24—that is 24 minutes past five—p.m., of course. And this is our plane. I'm sure you'll be interested to know that there are four flights a day from Gatwick to Madrid. The flight takes one and a half hours, and the return fare is £120. And here is my dear wife at Passport Control. This is where we found our suitcase again. This is the red channel, Goods to Declare, but here is my dear wife going into the green channel, Nothing to Declare. Home we go. Lights, please. And that, ladies and Gentlemen, was our holiday in Spain.</td></tr>

He's an inventor who can make petrol from beer. Very clever. Some men want to steal his formula, you see. They've got this girl, Ann, and they say to Brent, "Give us the formula or the girl dies." I forget what happens next.</td></tr>
