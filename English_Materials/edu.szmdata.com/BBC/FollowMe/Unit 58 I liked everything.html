			<tr><td class="roles">Dentist</td><td>You were here ten years ago, Mr. Baker. Ten years! We'll have a look and see what the situation is now. Open your mouth, please. Please open your mouth, Mr. Baker. I can't see your teeth if you don't open your mouth. Right. He won't open his mouth. What are we going to do? No, no. We talk. Mr. Baker must forget he's at the dentist's. We must talk about something else. Anything. Did you watch the film on television last night?</td></tr>

			<tr><td class="roles">Bob</td><td>Oh, I thought he was very good. I liked the way he walked into that bar.</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Dentist</td><td>Yes, that's true, but he didn't do much and he didn't say much. Did you see the film, Mr. Baker? What did you think of John Wayne?</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Bob</td><td>He didn't say much, either. Did you go to the Fringe Concert, Carol?</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Carol</td><td>Yes.</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Bob</td><td>What did you think of the Kicks?</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Carol</td><td>I thought they were very exciting. I liked the way she smiled.</td></tr>

			<tr><td class="roles">Carol</td><td>Oh, I thought he was very good&#160;...&#160;</td></tr>
