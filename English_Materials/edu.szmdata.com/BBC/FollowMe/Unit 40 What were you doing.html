			<tr><td class="roles">Paul</td><td>About me? Isn't there a more interesting subject we can talk about? Well, if we must talk about me, my first film was <i>Holiday Hotel</i>.People told me I was quite good in that.</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Helen</td><td>Oh, you were.</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Paul</td><td>That was in 1968. And then there was <i>October Night</i>. I played a doctor in that film.</td></tr>

That was for <i>Friday Night Flowers</i>. Oh—and I got married again —to Barbara. That's right, in 1975. Then in 1976 there was that very good film, <i>Peter's Problem</i>. Very funny. And after that people knew I could be funny, as well as serious. People don't think you can be both, Helen, but a good actor can be anything. Then in 1977 I was "the other man" in <i>The Only Man</i>. And I got married to Jennifer. 1978 — I was in <i>American Airport</i>. 1979, well, you know what I did in 1979, I'm sure—<i>The Beach</i>.</td></tr>
