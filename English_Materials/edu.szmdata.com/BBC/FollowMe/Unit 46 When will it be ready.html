<p class="FMH3">1. When will the car be ready?</p>
<p class="z">(<i>Ann and Fred want to go to France and Germany during the holidays. Fred is checking the car while Ann is talking to her friend Sally.) </i></p>
		<table border="0">
			<tr><td class="roles">Fred</td><td>Ah-ah, coffee! Yes, please.</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Ann</td><td>Here you are. When will the car be ready? </td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Fred</td><td> Soon. In a few minutes. Leave it to me!</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Ann</td><td>Good. He's getting the car ready. We're going to France and Germany during the holidays.</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Sally</td><td>Oh, that's good.</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Ann</td><td>Yes. Not like last year. It was terrible. We stayed at home during the holidays last year.</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Sally</td><td>All the time?</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Ann</td><td>Yes. Fred did jobs in the house. At least during the first three days he did, but he had one or two little accidents.</td></tr>
		</table>
<p class="z">(<i>Flashback: Fred drops hammer on toe. Fred unscrews water tap)</i>.</p>
		<table border="0">
			<tr><td class="roles">Sally</td><td>I see. So you cleaned up the house during the rest of the holidays?</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Ann</td><td>Yes.</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Sally</td><td>When are you going away?</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Ann</td><td>In a few days' time. Not till, Friday. Ah, there's Fred. Finished, Fred?</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Fred</td><td>Well, no. I've got one or two little problems, Ann. Where do these go?</td></tr>

<p class="FMH3">2. I used to cook all the time.</p>
		<table border="0">
			<tr><td class="roles">Ann</td><td>It's a pity George isn't here. Oh—sorry.</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Sally</td><td>It's all right, Ann. I don't mind. We're not married anymore. But I can still talk about him. Yes, it's a pity, because George was very good with cars. The problem was he wasn't very good with people, and he wasn't a very good husband.</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Ann</td><td>So now you're single again. What's it like?</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Sally</td><td>Now that I'm single again? Well, when I was married I used to cook all the time, and I used to clean the flat, and I used to wash clothes. Now I go out more.</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Ann</td><td>Visit old friends more. But George used to help you in some ways.</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Sally</td><td>Yes, he used to help me when he was at home. But he wasn't at home very often. And I used to wait for him. When I was married I used to be a very weak person, Ann.</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Ann</td><td>And now you're not?</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Sally</td><td>No, now I'm strong.</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Fred</td><td>Ah! I need a strong person.</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Sally</td><td>Oh?</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Fred</td><td>I want to push the car to Gosport's garage. It's not far.</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Sally</td><td>All right.</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Ann</td><td>I'll help too. We must have that car during the holidays. Fred isn't like George. He is always at home and always tries to help. I wish he wouldn't.</td></tr>

			<tr><td class="roles">Ann</td><td>Oh, no! In two weeks. But we're going to France and Germany during the holidays. We must have the car.</td></tr>
