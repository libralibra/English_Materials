			<tr><td class="roles">Sarah</td><td>A beautiful girl, of course.</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Alan</td><td>Oh, no. An interesting girl.</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Sarah</td><td>Interesting?</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Alan</td><td>Well, a girl who can talk about different things. A girl who reads, and goes to the theatre, and travels&#160;... I want a lot, don't I?</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Sarah</td><td>No. A lot of girls can talk about different things. Why not? And they do read, and go to the theatre, and travel&#160;...&#160;</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Alan</td><td>Do you?</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Sarah</td><td>Well, yes. Of course, girls who are interesting want to meet interesting men. My friend, for example—she'd like to meet a man with an interesting job, and is kind, and likes music and animals&#160;...&#160;</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Alan</td><td>Really?</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Sarah</td><td>Yes. Tell me, if you want to meet a girl, why don't you go to a social club? I go to one every week. You meet a lot of people.</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Alan</td><td>Could I come to your club?</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Sarah</td><td>Of course you could.</td></tr>

			<tr><td class="roles">Sarah</td><td>Do I make you comfortable, Mr. Thomson?</td></tr>

			<tr><td class="roles">Thomson</td><td>You decide, then, Sarah. I'd like you to be my secretary. A person, not a machine. And sometimes, not all the time, but sometimes, the job is very interesting. Ask Joan. She'll tell you. And then, you decide.</td></tr>

			<tr><td class="roles">Sarah</td><td>Something funny. I like funny books.</td></tr>
