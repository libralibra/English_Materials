<p class="FMH1">Unit 47: Where did you go?</p>

<p class="FMH3">1. What did you see this week?</p>
<p>(Our Week—<i>a weekly TV programme is about to start. But one of the speakers —Bates is not present yet. Rupert, the producer is very worried</i>.)</p>
		<table border="0">
			<tr><td class="roles">Producer</td><td>Where's Bates? Look at the time. </td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Secretary</td><td> What are you going to do?</td></tr>

			<tr><td class="roles">Sid</td><td>Are you Rupert Brown?</td></tr>

			<tr><td class="roles">Secretary</td><td>It's going to start now.</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Sid</td><td>What is it? <i>Our Week?</i> I could do that. </td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Secretary</td><td> Oh! You?</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Producer</td><td>All right. Sit there. Quick.</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Sid</td><td>OK.</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Secretary</td><td>But Rupert&#160;...&#160;</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Hostess</td><td>Good evening. And welcome again to <i>Our Week</i>. And with me this week are&#160;...&#160;</td></tr>

			<tr><td class="roles">Sid</td><td>Me? Sid Wallace—hello.</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Hostess</td><td>Good. Mavis, where did you go and what did you do this week?</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Mavis</td><td>I went to see <i>Congratulations</i>. It's on at the National Theatre. Gertrude Gawdy is in it— she's a nurse—and she's very, very good.</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Sid</td><td>Good Gawdy!</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Mavis</td><td>Yes. <i>Congratulations</i> is about a man and a woman, a doctor and a nurse. She loves him. He loves her. It's beautiful. All I can say is:&#160;...&#160;</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Sid</td><td>Go and see <i>Congratulations</i>!</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Mavis</td><td>Go and see <i>Congratulations</i>!</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Hostess</td><td>Thank you, Mavis. Hubert?</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Hubert</td><td>I went to the exhibition at the Tate. There are lots of new pictures by Print, Collick and Hellhouse.</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Sid</td><td>Who?</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Hubert</td><td>Print, Collick, and Hellhouse. Very well-known artists. On the ground floor in the first room, there's a wonderful picture by James Print—<i>My Daughter</i>.</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Sid</td><td>The daughter of James Print. She must be a misprint (Miss Print)!</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Hostess</td><td>Well, Mr. Wallace&#160;...&#160;</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Sid</td><td>Sid.</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Hostess</td><td>Er—Sid. What did you see this week?</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Sid</td><td>A football match. I went to see Chelsea at Stamford Bridge. The match began badly, but it got worse! The score was seven one, to the other side. It was a terrible game. I'm going to see Brentford next week. Football in the third division is just the same as the first division these days&#160;...&#160;</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Secretary</td><td>Rupert.</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Producer</td><td>Yes?</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Secretary</td><td>We're getting lots of phone calls.</td></tr>

<p class="FMH3">2. Where did you go this week?</p>
		<table border="0">
			<tr><td class="roles">Hostess</td><td>Mavis, where did you go this week?</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Mavis</td><td>I went to Chipping Leighton. It's a village in Sussex by the sea. About four hundred people live there. Most of them work on farms, or in the village shops. It's got a lovely old church, and there's a little museum. You can visit the museum on Wednesdays. There's also a village pub&#160;...&#160;</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Sid</td><td>Ah—a pub!</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Mavis</td><td>What I wanted to say was—you can stay at the pub. There's only one bus a day, so it's a good idea to take your car.</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Hostess</td><td>Thank you, Mavis. And where did you go this week, Hubert?</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Hubert</td><td>I visited the Lake District. As you know, it's a beautiful part of the country, in the north of England, about three hundred kilometres from here. Of course, it costs quite a lot to get there&#160;...&#160;</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Sid</td><td>You can say that again. It's terrible.</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Hubert</td><td>But it's famous for its countryside. It has beautiful hills and lakes, forests and rivers; you can go swimming, go sailing, go fishing, go for walks.</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Hostess</td><td>Thank you, Hubert.</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Sid</td><td>I went to see my brother this week. He lives in the next street to me. I don't get time to go to the Lake District, or villages in Sussex. Too much work. Anyway, where we live there are no hills, or lakes, or forests, or rivers —just a lot of factories and dirty buildings. But the people are friendly — and they are real.</td></tr>

		<table border="0">
			<tr><td class="roles">Producer</td><td>Well, it was them or you, Sid. Good luck! </td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Sid</td><td> Thanks. Hello, everyone. This is Sid Wallace, with <i>My Week</i>. This week I went to see a terrible film. It was called <i>Soup</i>. Don't go and see it&#160;...&#160;</td></tr>
