<p class="FMH1">Unit 54: Holiday plans</p>

<p class="FMH3">1. I like to be ready.</p>
<p>(<i>Here's a man who plans all his holidays. He likes to be ready</i>.)</p>
		<table border="0">
			<tr><td class="roles">Father</td><td>We have a minute or two before tea, David. We can wait in here.</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">David</td><td>Are you going somewhere?</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Father</td><td>What? Oh, these? I'm making plans for our next holiday.</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">David</td><td>Oh, yes.</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Father</td><td>I like to be ready, you know. For example, we're going to drive from Paris to Toulouse. There's a good road through Orleans and Limoges, and perhaps it's quicker to go that way. But sometimes it's better to go a longer way round. You see more, there's less traffic, so it's easier to drive.</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">David</td><td>How do you know which road is best? </td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Father</td><td> The guides, my boy. They tell you everything. Look—there's a good restaurant in Bourges, so that's where you stop for lunch. Then, in the evening, you should stop there and stay at that hotel. In the morning, before you leave, you should see the castle. I write it all down, you see, one page for every day. It all goes in here. I couldn't go on holiday without that, and without the maps and guides.</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">David</td><td>Oh?</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Father</td><td>Always make plans, David. That's the way. Always know what you're going to do, and when you're going to do it. Where are you going to go for your holiday?</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">David</td><td>Well—er—</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Emma</td><td>Daddy—David! Tea is ready.</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Father</td><td>Five o'clock. Time for tea.</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">David</td><td>Hello.</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Emma</td><td>What were you talking about?</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">David</td><td>Holiday plans.</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Emma</td><td>Oh!</td></tr>
		</table>

<p class="FMH3">2. We went there two years ago.</p>
		<table border="0">
			<tr><td class="roles">Mother</td><td>Have you and David decided where you're going to go on holiday this year, Emma?</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Emma</td><td>We thought about Cornwall.</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Father</td><td>Cornwall! Good idea! We went there two years ago, yes.</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Emma</td><td>Daddy can tell you everything about every holiday. He writes it all down.</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Father</td><td>Here it is. Cornwall. We left here on August 14th, and came back on the 21st. We went to Truro, and Falmouth, Penzance, Land's End —it's all here. All hotels we stayed at, how much they cost, what they were like.</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Emma</td><td>Whether it was raining or sunny&#160;...&#160;</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Father</td><td>Of course. And what we saw and did every day. I made the plans before the holiday, and then I wrote down what happened. On August 14th, we stayed at the Garden hotel. We paid twenty pounds for a comfortable room and a good breakfast. We visited the local museum, talked to local people. Sunny and warm.</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Mother</td><td>Yes, I remember that day.</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Father</td><td>You can borrow this if you like, David. Perhaps it will help you with your holiday plans.</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">David</td><td>Ah, well,&#160;...&#160;thank you, but you see, the thing is, we don't want to plan our holiday.</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Father</td><td>Don't want to plan your holiday!</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">David</td><td>No.</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Emma</td><td>No.</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Father</td><td>Good heavens!</td></tr>

<p class="FMH3">3. We want the holiday to be different.</p>
		<table border="0">
			<tr><td class="roles">Emma</td><td>You see, Daddy, David and I have to make i plans all the time, in our jobs.</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">David</td><td>We want the holiday to be different. We want to decide in the morning what we're going to do.</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Emma</td><td>Then perhaps decide something else at lunchtime.</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">David</td><td>We don't really want to know what's going to happen. That's what "holiday" means. Because when we're not on holiday, we do know what's going to happen.</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Emma</td><td>Every day.</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Father</td><td>I see. But then, the holidays you had with me and your mother, Emma. You didn't enjoy them?</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Emma</td><td>Of course, I did. So did mummy. You knew what was going to happen, but we didn't.</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Mother</td><td>You enjoyed making the plans, Cecil. We enjoyed the holiday.</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">David</td><td>So everyone was happy.</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Father</td><td>Are you sure?</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Emma</td><td>Of course.</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">David</td><td>By the way, have you ever been to Greece?</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Father</td><td>Yes.</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">David</td><td>Good. I'm going there next week. Can you tell me about the taxis? For example: how far is it from the airport to the centre of Athens? How much does it cost by taxi? Do I have to give a tip, and if so, how much?</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Father</td><td>I'll get my book on Greece.</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">David</td><td>Thanks.</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Father</td><td>Just a minute, you don't really want to know, do you? You're trying to be kind to an old fool.</td></tr>

<p class="FMH3">4. I always plan business trips.</p>
		<table border="0">
			<tr><td class="roles">David</td><td>I'm not being kind. I really want to know. I'm going to Greece on a business trip, and I always plan business trips.</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Father</td><td>Ah!</td></tr>
