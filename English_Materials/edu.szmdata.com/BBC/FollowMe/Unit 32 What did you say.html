			<tr><td class="roles">Sergeant</td><td>Peters? Bramble Lane? I think I know the family.</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Mary</td><td>Well, Mrs. Russell was bringing some money for her daughter—two hundred pounds. She had it in her bag on the train, but when she got here, the bag was gone.</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Sergeant</td><td>OK. I'll talk to her.</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Mary</td><td>Oh, by the way, there was a young man with long hair on the train sitting next to Mrs. Russell. And after he got off, she couldn't find her bag.</td></tr>
