			<tr><td class="roles">Barbara</td><td>What's it like?</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Debbie</td><td>Well, the place itself is all right. But there's a woman who lives downstairs.</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Barbara</td><td>And she's not all right?</td></tr>

			<tr><td class="roles">Debbie</td><td>Only during the day?</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Woman</td><td>Yes. At night it's a bedroom.</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Debbie</td><td>I see. And there's a kitchen?</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Woman</td><td>The kitchen!</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Debbie</td><td>Oh, yes. Is the cooker gas or electric?</td></tr>
