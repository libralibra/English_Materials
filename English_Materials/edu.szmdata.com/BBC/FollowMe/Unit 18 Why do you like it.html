<p class="FMH1">Unit 18: Why do you like it?</p>

<p class="FMH3">1. Why do you like dogs?</p>
		<table border="0">
			<tr><td class="roles">Francis</td><td>Hello. This is a present for Jane, my secretary. She likes presents.</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Jane</td><td>I like you, Francis.</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Francis</td><td>Why? Why do you like me?</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Jane</td><td>Because you give me presents.</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Francis</td><td>Oh, yes. Here you are. It's a present for you.</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Jane</td><td>Oh, Francis. How nice! Thank you. Thank you very much.</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Francis</td><td>Yes. Why do people like things? Let's see. English people like animals. Some people like dogs, because they're friendly. Some people prefer cats, because they're quiet. Some people like parrots, because they talk.</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Parrot</td><td>Hello.</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Francis</td><td>Why do you like dogs?</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Man</td><td>Because they're friendly.</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">1st&#160;Woman</td><td>I don't like dogs. I prefer cats.</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Francis</td><td>Why do you prefer cats?</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">1st&#160;Woman</td><td>Because they're quiet. They don't make much noise.</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Francis</td><td>Why do you like parrots?</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">2nd&#160;Woman</td><td>Because they talk.</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Francis</td><td>That parrot doesn't talk.</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Parrot</td><td>Yes, Ido.</td></tr>
		</table>

<p class="FMH3">2. Here's a lamp, which looks nice.</p>
		<table border="0">
			<tr><td class="roles">Husband</td><td>This one. Let's buy this lamp.</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Wife</td><td>No. It's too big. This one is better.</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Husband</td><td>No. Not that one, please.</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Wife</td><td>Why not?</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Husband</td><td>My mother won't like it.</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Wife</td><td>But it's not for your mother. It's for us, and I like it.</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Husband</td><td>What about this one?</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Wife</td><td>No, I don't like it at all. I don't like the colour. I prefer that one. What do you think of it?</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Husband</td><td>Oh, no.</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Wife</td><td>Why don't you like that one?</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Husband</td><td>Because it's too big and too expensive. We can't buy a lamp, which costs 55 pounds.</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Francis</td><td>Can I help you?</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Husband</td><td>Yes. Would you show us a lamp? One which is not too big and which isn't expensive and which looks nice.</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Francis</td><td>This one looks nice. Here's a lamp which looks nice. And here's one which isn't expensive.</td></tr>
		</table>

<p class="FMH3">3. It's the same size but a different colour.</p>
		<table border="0">
			<tr><td class="roles">Wife</td><td>Turn the radio off, darling.</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Husband</td><td>Why?</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Wife</td><td>It's late. It's quarter past twelve.</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Husband</td><td>All right. Oh, would you turn the light on?</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Wife</td><td>Oh! God!</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Wife</td><td>May we have another lamp?</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Francis</td><td>Yes, of course, madam. But why?</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Wife</td><td>Because this one doesn't work.</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Husband</td><td>Would you please give us one which works?</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Francis</td><td>Certainly, sir. Just one moment, please. Here you are.</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Wife</td><td>That's not the same. It's smaller than this one.</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Francis</td><td>You're right. It isn't the same. It's different. It's a different size.</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Husband</td><td>This one's a different colour.</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Francis</td><td>Same size&#151;different colour&#160;...&#160;</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Husband</td><td>May we have one, which is the same size and the same colour?</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Francis</td><td>This is the right one. These lamps are the same. These lamps are different. Here you are. This one will work.</td></tr>
