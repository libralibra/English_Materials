<p class="FMH3">1. I'm not sure, but I think&#160;...&#160;</p>
<p class="z">(<i>Betty and Joan meet in the library when they were looking for books</i>.)</p>
		<table border="0">
			<tr><td class="roles">Joan</td><td>Oh, hello, Betty. It's you?</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Betty</td><td>Yes. Hello, Joan. How are you?</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Joan</td><td>Fine, thanks.</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Betty</td><td>Have the new people come yet, next door? </td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Joan</td><td> Yes. Two days ago. In fact, that's our new neighbour over there. He's the man next door. </td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Betty</td><td> Oh! Do you know anything about him? </td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Joan</td><td> Well. I know he's married, and his wife looks very nice. And I know they've got two children—two girls.</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Betty</td><td>Do you know where they come from?</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Joan</td><td>I'm not sure, but I think they used to live in Oxford.</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Betty</td><td>And do you know what he does? What's his job?</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Joan</td><td>I don't know.</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Betty</td><td>Perhaps&#160;... perhaps he hasn't got a job.</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Joan</td><td>Oh, I'm sure he has. Why do you say that, Betty?</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Betty</td><td>Well, he is here, isn't he? In the library, I mean. He's not at work.</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Joan</td><td>Oh, yes. I see what you mean.</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Betty</td><td>Perhaps he has a special kind of job, or he had a job in Oxford, but hasn't got one here. How old is he, do you think?</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Joan</td><td>I don't know. Forty. Perhaps forty-five.</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Betty</td><td>That's difficult.</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Joan</td><td>Difficult?</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Betty</td><td>If he's looking for a new job.</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Joan</td><td>Oh. But we don't know if he's looking for a new job.</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Betty</td><td>What about his wife? Are you sure she is his wife?</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Joan</td><td>Betty! Really!</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Betty</td><td>Have you talked to her yet?</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Joan</td><td>No. But I'm sure she's a very nice woman. I'm going to ask her to come and have coffee.</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Betty</td><td>Look. Come on.</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Assistant</td><td>You've found something, then, Mrs. James.</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Betty</td><td>Yes, thanks. These three.</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Joan</td><td>And I'll take these, please.</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Assistant</td><td>Right. Oh, by the way, this is Mr. Castle, the new librarian. This is Mrs. James and Mrs. Archer.</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Castle</td><td>Good morning, ladies.</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Joan</td><td>The new librarian!</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Castle</td><td>I see you like stories, Mrs. James.</td></tr>

<p class="FMH3">2. There's no one else like him.</p>

			<tr><td class="roles">Assistant</td><td>Sorry?</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Librarian</td><td>Who's that?</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Assistant</td><td>Oh, it's all right. He comes here every day. </td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Librarian</td><td> Do you know who he is?</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Assistant</td><td>Yes. Mr. Williams.</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Librarian</td><td>How old is he?</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Assistant</td><td>I don't know how old he is. It's difficult to say, isn't it? Perhaps he's fifty—perhaps he's eighty.</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Librarian</td><td>Are you sure that he's—er—all right? </td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Assistant</td><td> Oh, yes. He's never a problem.</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Librarian</td><td>What's he like?</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Assistant</td><td>He's very quiet, really. He comes in every day, just for a minute or two, and looks for a book. His book.</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Librarian</td><td>His book?</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Assistant</td><td>Yes.</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Librarian</td><td>You mean, he wrote it?</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Assistant</td><td>No. I don't think he's written any books. I'm not sure, but I don't think he ever went to school.</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Librarian</td><td>Ah! But you said "his book".</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Assistant</td><td>Well, it's our book, really. He gave it to us about two years ago. I think it's the only book he's ever read.</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Librarian</td><td>And now he comes here and borrows it?</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Assistant</td><td>Oh no. He never takes it home. But he wants to know if someone else has it.</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Librarian</td><td>I see.</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Assistant</td><td>He's a nice man, and I'm sure he's happy when the book isn't there.</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Librarian</td><td>Yes.</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Assistant</td><td>You see, he says the book is very good. He liked it, and he wants other people to read it.</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Librarian</td><td>Well, all right. Tell me, are there any more readers — like Mr. Williams, I mean?</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Assistant</td><td>Oh no. There's no one else like him.</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Mr.&#160;Williams</td><td>It's not there today, Miss Jones.</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Assistant</td><td>Good. By the way, Mr. Williams, this is Mr. Castle, the new librarian.</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Librarian</td><td>Hello, Mr. Williams.</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Mr.&#160;Williams</td><td>Hello. My book's not there today.</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Librarian</td><td>Er—good.</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Mr.&#160;Williams</td><td>I'll be in tomorrow.</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Assistant</td><td>Yes, all right, Goodbye.</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Librarian</td><td>Goodbye. What is his book, by the way? I must read it.</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Assistant</td><td>You can read it now. Well, I know it makes him happy, so why not?</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Librarian</td><td>As you say, Miss Jones, why not?</td></tr>
