			<tr><td class="roles">Jane</td><td>This one?</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">1st&#160;Woman</td><td>No. That coat isn't mine. Mine is the one next to it.</td></tr>

			<tr><td class="roles">1st&#160;Woman</td><td>No, it isn't.</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Jane</td><td>Oh, dear. Whose is it?</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">1st&#160;Woman</td><td>Don't worry. I think it's my husband's. John, is that your umbrella?</td></tr>

			<tr><td class="roles">Jane</td><td>Excuse me, madam. Is it your bag?</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">2nd&#160;Woman</td><td>No, it isn't. But that's our suitcase. The brown one. And that suitcase is ours too.</td></tr>

			<tr><td class="roles">Husband</td><td>What's it like?</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="roles">Clerk</td><td>It's smaller than the Queen's. It's in the same street. It's near the shops, and&#160;...&#160;</td></tr>

		<table border="0">
			<tr><td class="roles">Francis</td><td>Here's the weather forecast for the next 24 hours. In the north of Scotland there will be snow with strong winds. It will be very cold. In England and Wales the weather will be much better. There will be some fog in the morning. But the fog will clear, and in the south it'll be a fine day with some sunshine. It will be quite warm. In the west it'll be cold in the morning, but it will get warmer and perhaps there will be some sunshine later. In the east, the day will start fine, but then the weather will change. In the afternoon, there will be some rain. It will get cooler.</td></tr>
