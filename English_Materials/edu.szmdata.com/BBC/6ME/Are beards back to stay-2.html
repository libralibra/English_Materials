		<tr><td class="roles">Rob: </td><td>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English. I'm Rob&#160;...&#160;</td></tr>
		<tr><td class="roles">Neil: </td><td>&#160;...&#160;and I'm Neil. Hello.</td></tr>
		<tr><td class="roles">Rob: </td><td>Hi there, Neil! Now, Neil&#160;... what's that on your face? </td></tr>
		<tr><td class="roles">Neil: </td><td>What&#160;... this? It's a beard, Rob. Have you never seen one before?</td></tr>
		<tr><td class="roles">Rob: </td><td>I have. But I've never seen one on you before&#160;... and I'm surprised to say, it looks good on you! </td></tr>
		<tr><td class="roles">Neil: </td><td>Well, thank you! I thought I'd get on the beard bandwagon, you know. Beards are <strong>all the rage</strong> at the moment&#151;that means 'very fashionable'. </td></tr>
		<tr><td class="roles">Rob: </td><td>And <strong>to get on a bandwagon</strong> is when you join other people in doing something that has become popular&#151;perhaps because you hope to become popular yourself! </td></tr>
		<tr><td class="roles">Neil: </td><td>Well, that doesn't apply to me, Rob, because, as you know, I'm very popular already.</td></tr>
		<tr><td class="roles">Rob: </td><td>Yes. Yes, I know that, of course&#160;... Anyway, beards are such <strong>a talking point</strong>&#151;a subject that a lot of people are discussing&#151;that we decided to talk about them on today's programme! So are you ready for today's question, Neil? What's the name for someone who loves beards? Is it&#160;...&#160;</td></tr>
	</table>
	<ol type="a">
		<li>barbophile?</li>
		<li>pogonophile? <i>or</i></li>
		<li>pelophile?</li>
	</ol>
	<table border="0">
		<tr><td class="roles">Neil: </td><td>Hmm. All the answers sound tempting. But I'm going to go for a) barbophile.</td></tr>
		<tr><td class="roles">Rob: </td><td>Right. OK, well we'll find out if you're right or wrong later on. But this is interesting: a new scientific study suggests that the more beards there are in a population, the less attractive they become&#151;and this currently gives clean-shaven men a competitive advantage. </td></tr>
		<tr><td class="roles">Neil: </td><td>Oh, no! That's bad news for me, then! <strong>Competitive advantage</strong> means when a condition or circumstance puts you in a favourable position&#151;in this case, being <strong>clean-shaven</strong> or having no facial hair. </td></tr>
		<tr><td class="roles">Rob: </td><td>That's right. We've reached 'peak beard' apparently. Beard popularity has <strong>peaked</strong>&#151;or reached its highest point&#151;and will decline in popularity from this point. </td></tr>
		<tr><td class="roles">Neil: </td><td>OK. Let's listen to writer, Lucinda Hawksley, talking about beards through history. And listen out for a word that means women's struggle to achieve the same rights and opportunities as men.</td></tr>
		<tr><td class="roles">Lucinda Hawksley: </td><td>(writer of Moustaches, Whiskers and Beards) It's interesting, while I was writing the book I came to realize that the most heavily bearded times in Britain are either when women are in power, such as Elizabeth I or Queen Victoria, or when there's a big discussion of feminism&#151;and it is really interesting that in the last few years there's been so much more discussion of feminism. You get a woman on the throne and men go, 'Oh, got to have a beard.' It's really strange. Or in the 60s or 70s with all the kind of, you know, big thing about women's lib, suddenly the beard becomes huge here.</td></tr>
		<tr><td class="roles">Rob: </td><td>Well, needless to say Lucinda doesn't have a beard, but she certainly knows a lot about them. She's the great great granddaughter of famous writer Charles Dickens, who <strong>sported</strong>&#151;or wore&#151;a very flamboyant beard. <strong>Flamboyant</strong> means eye-catching and different. </td></tr>
		<tr><td class="roles">Neil: </td><td>Now, did you spot the word for women's struggle to achieve the same rights as men? </td></tr>
		<tr><td class="roles">Rob: </td><td>Yes. It's <strong>feminism</strong>. She also talks about <strong>women's lib</strong>, which is short for women's liberation. And this has a similar meaning to feminism. So, what do you think, Neil? Are beards a show of testosterone in reaction to powerful women? Is that why you've grown your beard?</td></tr>
		<tr><td class="roles">Neil: </td><td>I don't think it's <strong>testosterone</strong>&#151;that's the main male hormone. For me, it's laziness. I'm flying the flag for men's lib&#151;liberation from the razor.</td></tr>
		<tr><td class="roles">Rob: </td><td>Right. Well, I'm not sure whether that's a worthy cause or not, Neil. Let's hear from Brock Elbank, the photographer behind the exhibition 'Beard'. He's talking about one of the people he photographed.</td></tr>
		<tr><td class="roles">Brock Elbank: </td><td>(photographer) I found Jimmy on a friend's Facebook page whilst I was in Sydney. Invited him to come to my home studio for a portrait and I posted it and it got reblogged over half a million times in four hours. I mean I think when Jimmy and I&#160;... when I met Jimmy he told me about his 'beard season' melanoma charity and I was kind of on board from the get go.</td></tr>
		<tr><td class="roles">Neil: </td><td>So Jimmy must have a pretty awesome beard! </td></tr>
		<tr><td class="roles">Rob: </td><td>Indeed. We should check out the Beard exhibition and find out. But Jimmy has a beard for a special reason, right Neil?</td></tr>
		<tr><td class="roles">Neil: </td><td>That's right. Yes. Brock mentions Jimmy's melanoma charity. <strong>Melanoma</strong> is a serious type of skin cancer and Jimmy is raising money and awareness to help people who suffer from it.</td></tr>
		<tr><td class="roles">Rob: </td><td>And Brock says he was <strong>on</strong> <strong>board from the get go</strong>&#151;meaning he wanted to be involved with the charity right from the start.</td></tr>
		<tr><td class="roles">Neil: </td><td>We should also mention 'Movember' and 'Decembeard'&#151;both campaigns invite men to get hairy for good causes.</td></tr>
		<tr><td class="roles">Rob: </td><td>That's right, good causes&#151;moustaches in November and beards in December. Now, let's have the answer to the quiz question. I asked: what's the name for someone who loves beards. Was it: </td></tr>

		<li>pogonopile <i>or</i></li>
		<li>pelophile</li>
	</ol>
	<table border="0">
		<tr><td class="roles">Neil: </td><td>And I said a) barbophile. </td></tr>
		<tr><td class="roles">Rob: </td><td>Wrong, I'm afraid. The answer is actually b) pogonophile.</td></tr>
		<tr><td class="roles">Neil: </td><td>Oh, well, you can't win them all. Now then, Rob, can we hear today's words again?</td></tr>
		<tr><td class="roles">Rob: </td><td>Sure. We heard:</td></tr>
