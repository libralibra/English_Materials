	<p class="subTitle">What are gibbons singing about?</p>
	<p><strong>Gibbons</strong> belong to a group of animals called <strong>primates</strong>. They are small apes that live in South East Asia. When they communicate with each other they sound like they are singing&#151;and some sing in <strong>duets</strong>&#151;but why?</p>
	<p>Listen to Rob and Neil discussing <strong>screeching</strong> monkeys, the songs that gibbons sing and the evolution of human language whilst teaching some related vocabulary.</p>
	<p>This week's question:</p>
	<p>How far can a gibbon's voice travel through the forest? Is it&#160;...&#160;</p>

		<tr><td class="roles">Rob: </td><td>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English. I'm Rob&#160;...&#160;</td></tr>
		<tr><td class="roles">Neil: </td><td>And hello! I'm Neil.</td></tr>
		<tr><td class="roles">Rob: </td><td>Hi there Neil. Have you ever had a close encounter with a monkey or an ape? </td></tr>
		<tr><td class="roles">Neil: </td><td>Well I'm sitting right next to you, Rob?</td></tr>
		<tr><td class="roles">Rob: </td><td>Very funny. Neil is referring to the fact that all humans are descended from apes, and apes and monkeys belong to a group of animals called <strong>primates</strong>. The difference is that monkeys have tails, and apes don't. </td></tr>
		<tr><td class="roles">Neil: </td><td>Well, I didn't know that. On a serious note&#160;... I had <strong>a close shave</strong> with some monkeys once in Bali.</td></tr>
		<tr><td class="roles">Rob: </td><td>A close shave is where you only just manage to avoid a dangerous situation. So Neil, what happened?</td></tr>
		<tr><td class="roles">Neil: </td><td>I was walking up a mountain on my own and suddenly a bunch of monkeys jumped out of nowhere, blocking my path.</td></tr>
		<tr><td class="roles">Rob: </td><td>Oh goodness! OK. So what did you do?</td></tr>
		<tr><td class="roles">Neil: </td><td>After standing there for ages while the monkeys screeched at me, I turned round and walked back the way I came.</td></tr>
		<tr><td class="roles">Rob: </td><td>OK. If you <strong>screech</strong> at someone it means to make a loud, high and unpleasant sound. So the monkeys won that <strong>face-off</strong>, then!</td></tr>
		<tr><td class="roles">Neil: </td><td>Absolutely! Yes, they did! And a face-off, by the way, means an argument or fight.</td></tr>
		<tr><td class="roles">Rob: </td><td>Well, today's show is about gibbons and the different sounds they make. <strong>Gibbons</strong> are small apes that live in Southeast Asia. And while Neil's monkeys screech unpleasantly, gibbons sound like they are singing.</td></tr>
		<tr><td class="roles">Neil: </td><td>Musical apes&#151;that's nice! So how about today's quiz question, Rob?</td></tr>
		<tr><td class="roles">Rob: </td><td>OK, good idea. How far can a gibbon's voice travel through the forest? Is it&#160;...&#160;</td></tr>

	<ol type="a">
		<li>500m</li>
		<li>1km <i>or</i></li>
		<li>5km?</li>
	</ol>
	<table border="0">
		<tr><td class="roles">Neil: </td><td>Hmm. Well, I have to guess and I'm going to say b) 1km.</td></tr>
		<tr><td class="roles">Rob: </td><td>You've never heard one.</td></tr>
		<tr><td class="roles">Neil: </td><td>Never heard one&#160;...&#160;</td></tr>
		<tr><td class="roles">Rob: </td><td>OK. We'll find out later on in the programme whether you're right or wrong. Now let's listen to what a gibbon really sounds like.</td></tr>
		<tr><td class="roles">Interviewer:: </td><td> Let's just hear this. [gibbons calling] That's an absolutely wonderful, evocative sound, isn't it? Beautiful sound. And what are they doing there then? That is&#160;... I said talking to each other. </td></tr>
		<tr><td class="roles">Dr Clarke:: </td><td> Well this is their&#160;... They're singing together. So a male and a female, when they hold a territory together, will sing every morning what they call a duet. All the groups&#160;...&#160;</td></tr>
		<tr><td class="roles">Interviewer:: </td><td> What we call a duet.</td></tr>
		<tr><td class="roles">Dr Clarke:: </td><td> Yes, absolutely. And they'll all sing together at the same time, and the whole forest will be alive with this cacophony of song.</td></tr>
		<tr><td class="roles">Rob: </td><td>So the gibbons make an <strong>evocative</strong> sound. If something is evocative it brings strong feelings or memories to mind.</td></tr>
		<tr><td class="roles">Neil: </td><td>And something that is evocative is usually pleasant, Rob.</td></tr>
		<tr><td class="roles">Rob: </td><td>It is. And what's also interesting is that the apes are singing in pairs&#151;one male and one female. They are singing <strong>duets</strong> together. So a duet is a song sung by two people&#151;or in this case, sung by two gibbons!</td></tr>
		<tr><td class="roles">Neil: </td><td>And a lot of gibbons are singing duets at the same time&#151;which Dr Clarke describes as a <strong>cacophony</strong>. Cacophony means a mix of loud noises, which often sound out of tune.</td></tr>
		<tr><td class="roles">Rob: </td><td>And that could easily describe us singing together! </td></tr>
		<tr><td class="roles">Neil: </td><td>Let's not do that.</td></tr>
		<tr><td class="roles">Rob: </td><td>But what's the reason for the gibbon duets, Neil?</td></tr>
		<tr><td class="roles">Neil: </td><td>Well, the songs advertise the relationship between the male and the female. And they also help to make clear which <strong>territory</strong>&#151;or bit of land&#151;belongs to a pair or group of gibbons.</td></tr>
		<tr><td class="roles">Rob: </td><td>Gibbons also use different sounds to <strong>alert</strong>&#151;or warn&#151;other gibbons about danger from <strong>predators</strong>&#151;these are animals that eat other animals. The gibbons use a quiet 'hoo hoo' call to communicate that a leopard is nearby, and an even quieter 'hoo hoo' call for an eagle.</td></tr>
		<tr><td class="roles">Neil: </td><td>You're very good at that Rob. </td></tr>
		<tr><td class="roles">Rob: </td><td>Thank you.</td></tr>
		<tr><td class="roles">Neil: </td><td>Now let's hear more from Dr Clarke about this. How does she describe language?</td></tr>
		<tr><td class="roles">Dr Esther Clarke: </td><td>(researcher at Durham University) Yes, so the idea is that if we find things like context-specific calling in non-human primates, it suggests that way back in time the ancestor that we shared with them also had context-specific calling so basically it just gives us some clues [as] to the evolutionary roots of complex communication like language. </td></tr>
		<tr><td class="roles">Rob: </td><td>Dr Clarke says that if we go far enough back in time humans and other primates such as monkeys and apes have the same <strong>ancestor</strong>. </td></tr>
		<tr><td class="roles">Neil: </td><td>Right. And ancestor means an animal&#151;or human&#151;from the past that a modern animal or human has descended from. So if this common ancestor used <strong>context-specific</strong> calls like modern gibbons&#151;then it could have passed on this ability to humans a long time ago.</td></tr>
		<tr><td class="roles">Rob: </td><td>Context-specific calling means different calls for different situations, for example one call for 'leopard' and another for 'eagle'.</td></tr>
		<tr><td class="roles">Neil: </td><td>And <strong>evolutionary</strong> means a gradual process of change or development.</td></tr>
		<tr><td class="roles">Rob: </td><td>OK, let's have the answer to the quiz question. Earlier I asked: How far can a gibbon's voice travel through the forest? Is it: </td></tr>

	</ol>
	<table border="0">
		<tr><td class="roles">Neil: </td><td>And I said b) 1km. </td></tr>
		<tr><td class="roles">Rob: </td><td>And you were right! A good guess! Perhaps you do know a lot about gibbons. So well done! Now, can we hear today's words again maybe in a gibbon's voice Neil?</td></tr>
		<tr><td class="roles">Neil: </td><td>I'm not sure about that. I'll do it in a human voice. </td></tr>
