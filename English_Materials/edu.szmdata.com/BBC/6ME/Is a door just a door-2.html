		<tr><td class="roles">Neil: </td><td>&#160;...&#160;and I'm Neil. Hello.</td></tr>
		<tr><td class="roles">Rob: </td><td>Hello, Neil! You look pleased today, Neil. </td></tr>
		<tr><td class="roles">Neil: </td><td>I am pleased. I just moved into my new flat! </td></tr>
		<tr><td class="roles">Rob: </td><td>OK, fantastic! Congratulations! Where is this new flat? </td></tr>
		<tr><td class="roles">Neil: </td><td>It's in the city. It's a one-bed flat so it's <strong>bijoux</strong>&#151;meaning small but attractive. There's a balcony, I've got a couple of deckchairs, and a barbecue&#160;...&#160;</td></tr>
		<tr><td class="roles">Rob: </td><td>I can't wait to see it. It sounds perfect. Well, today we're discussing housing&#151;and why in some buildings there are separate entrances for rich and poor residents! So, are you ready for today's quiz question, Neil?</td></tr>
		<tr><td class="roles">Neil: </td><td>I'm all ears.</td></tr>
		<tr><td class="roles">Rob: </td><td>OK, so you mean you're listening carefully.</td></tr>
		<tr><td class="roles">Neil: </td><td>I am.</td></tr>
		<tr><td class="roles">Rob: </td><td>Right. What does 'social housing' mean? Is it housing for people who&#160;...&#160;</td></tr>
	</table>
	<ol type="a">
		<li>want to buy or rent at a low price?</li>
		<li>want to live together sharing facilities? <i>or</i></li>
		<li>aren't able to pay any rent at all?</li>
	</ol>
	<table border="0">
		<tr><td class="roles">Neil: </td><td>OK, I think the answer is a) to buy or rent at a low price.</td></tr>
		<tr><td class="roles">Rob: </td><td>OK. Well, we'll see if you were right or wrong later on in the programme. So, have you met your neighbours yet, Neil?</td></tr>
		<tr><td class="roles">Neil: </td><td>Yes&#151;I bumped into one couple as I was leaving for work this morning.</td></tr>
		<tr><td class="roles">Rob: </td><td>I see.<strong> Bump into</strong> means to meet somebody by chance. So were they friendly?</td></tr>
		<tr><td class="roles">Neil: </td><td>Well, they complained about me blocking the communal area with my bike&#151;also about my guitar playing. But apart from that, they seemed nice!</td></tr>
		<tr><td class="roles">Rob: </td><td>A <strong>communal area</strong> is an area that is shared by a number of people. Well, I hate to say it, Neil, but your guitar playing is annoying!</td></tr>
		<tr><td class="roles">Neil: </td><td>Oh, Rob, genius isn't appreciated here, I think. OK&#160;... Let's listen to the journalist Tom Bateman talking about rich and poor doors.</td></tr>
		<tr><td class="roles">Tom Bateman: </td><td>(journalist) In front of us here is a 20-storey building. Right about me I got tinted blue glass windows and balconies on every floor as you look from the street. And there is a very plush foyer. A sign in the window says 'luxurious penthouses with spectacular views.'</td></tr>
		<tr><td class="roles">Neil: </td><td>But this is what the journalist Tom Bateman saw when he went around the other side of the same building.</td></tr>
		<tr><td class="roles">Tom Bateman: </td><td>(journalist) So as you come down the side of the building, you can see the windows&#151;quite small windows&#151;of the flats above here&#151;certainly no balconies. This is a big grey concrete wall and as you walk down an alleyway towards the other door.</td></tr>
		<tr><td class="roles">Rob: </td><td>So this building has one entrance with a <strong>plush</strong>&#151;or expensive and luxurious&#151;foyer. And <strong>foyer</strong> means entrance hall. Then there's another entrance down an <strong>alleyway</strong>&#151;or narrow passage between buildings.</td></tr>
		<tr><td class="roles">Neil: </td><td>This entrance leads to flats with small windows and no balconies. Why's that, Rob? </td></tr>
		<tr><td class="roles">Rob: </td><td>That's because the alleyway entrance is the so-called 'poor door'. There' no swanky foyer or tinted glass windows for these residents because they pay less rent than the people living in the apartments at the front.</td></tr>
		<tr><td class="roles">Neil: </td><td><strong>Swanky</strong> means something fashionable and expensive that is designed to impress people. And <strong>tinted</strong> glass is coloured glass&#151;so people can't look through your windows.</td></tr>
		<tr><td class="roles">Rob: </td><td>That sounds useful! Do you have tinted glass windows, Neil?</td></tr>
		<tr><td class="roles">Neil: </td><td>No, I don't. Tinted sunglasses are all that I can afford. So what do people think about having a rich door and a poor door for the same building, Rob? </td></tr>
		<tr><td class="roles">Rob: </td><td>Well, some people think it's terrible. They say it's <strong>segregation</strong>&#151;or separation and different treatment of people&#151;and I can't believe the poor-door people put up with it really!</td></tr>
		<tr><td class="roles">Neil: </td><td><strong>To</strong> <strong>put up with something</strong> means to accept something that is annoying without complaining about it. The thing is, though, the poor-door people don't pay nearly as much rent. And they don't have to pay the same service charges that the rich-door people pay.</td></tr>
		<tr><td class="roles">Rob: </td><td>A <strong>service charge </strong>is an amount of money you pay to the owner of an apartment building for things like putting out the rubbish. Well, let's listen to an experience of a poor-door resident. </td></tr>
		<tr><td class="roles">Abdul Mohammed: </td><td>(resident of One Commercial St, City of London) We can't use the lift&#160;... because it's for the rich people. So whenever the doors open, I use it. So they try and tell me off for using it. I say, 'here, come, take me to court&#151;I don't mind'. </td></tr>
		<tr><td class="roles">Neil: </td><td>So what has Abdul been doing that the rich-door residents don't like, Rob?</td></tr>
		<tr><td class="roles">Rob: </td><td>Well, he's been using their lift because it's near his apartment door.</td></tr>
		<tr><td class="roles">Neil: </td><td>And what does Abdul mean when he says, 'come, take me to court'?</td></tr>
		<tr><td class="roles">Rob: </td><td>He's inviting the rich-door residents to take legal action against him, but Abdul doesn't really think he's doing anything wrong. </td></tr>
		<tr><td class="roles">Neil: </td><td>OK, it's time to hear the answer to today's quiz question.</td></tr>
		<tr><td class="roles">Rob: </td><td>Yes. What does 'social housing' mean? Is it flats or houses for people&#160;...&#160;</td></tr>
