<ul>
	<li>I was so fed up with the way my husband dressed. He looked so untidy all the time! I threw out all his old clothes and took him shopping for a complete new wardrobe. Now he's had a makeover, he looks as handsome as he did when we first met.</li>
	<li>- This room looks so old-fashioned! It really needs a makeover.
<br />- Yes, if we paint the walls and change the curtains it will look so much better.</li>
