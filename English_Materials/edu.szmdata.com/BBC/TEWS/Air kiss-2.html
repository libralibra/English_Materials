<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>When is a kiss not a kiss? Neil and Feifei explain a certain type of greeting and farewell which is like a kiss but doesn't involve touching lips!</p>
<h3>Transcript</h3>

<p><strong>Neil</strong>
<br /> Hello and welcome to The English We Speak from BBC Learning English, I'm Neil and with me is Feifei.</p>

<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Hello. You seem a bit tired Neil. Late night?</p>

<p><strong>Neil</strong>
<br /> Yeah I had to go to this old university reunion thing&#151;which was fine&#151;but by the time all the goodbyes and air kisses were over it was really late.</p>

<p><strong>Feifei</strong>
<br /> Air kisses? You were kissing the air?</p>

<p><strong>Neil</strong>
<br /> You know, those kisses people give each other where their lips never actually touch each other's? They just make the noise.</p>

<p><strong>Feifei</strong>
<br /> Ah yes I know. When you meet up with people you know at a social event and to greet and say goodbye you pretend to kiss.</p>

<p><strong>Neil</strong>
<br /> That's it. Usually you touch cheeks on either side and make a kissing noise but the lips never touch. Sometimes the cheeks don't touch either. And that is an air kiss.</p>

<p><strong>Feifei</strong>
<br /> Let's hear some examples.</p>


<p><strong>Examples<br /></strong>I always feel so awkward at parties. I hate all those air kisses and small talk. Urgh, so phoney!</p>
<p>Charles, so wonderful to see you, mwah! Mwah! Charles?! No lips, please. Let's stick to air kisses.</p>
<p>Woman: So, go on, tell me&#151;did you kiss her?
<br />Man: Well, I air-kissed her. Does that count?
<br />Woman: No it does not!</p>

<p><strong>Neil</strong>
<br /> An air kiss. A type of greeting and farewell between friends at social events.</p>

<p><strong>Feifei</strong>
<br /> A kiss in which the two people's lips do not touch!</p>

<p><strong>Neil</strong>
<br /> That's it&#151;cheek to cheek and a big kissing noise into the air. Mwah! Shall we end with an air kiss to our audience? After all, they are our friends.</p>

<p><strong>Both</strong>
<br /> Bye! Mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah.</p>
