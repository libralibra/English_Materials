	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> Hello, Welcome to The English We Speak from BBC Learning English. I'm Helen.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> And I'm Rob.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> Rob, can I ask you something?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Yes, of course. Go ahead.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> My son's friends came to visit at the weekend. They were all in the bedroom playing with dinosaurs.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Oh right. Sounds fun.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> Yeah, I even let them watch a dinosaur film and play a computer game. Then I heard one of them say his parents were dinosaurs.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Oh, dear.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> I'm a mum, I don't think I look anything like a dinosaur, do I?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> No, you don't look like one at all. You are 100% human! What did the boy say about his parents?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> He said that they don't have a TV at home, and that his parents don't have mobile phones either. I was quite surprised by that.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> No wonder he thinks his parents are dinosaurs. When we call someone a 'dinosaur', we mean they're living in the past, they're not very modern, and probably don't use a lot of technology.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> I see. So, if I don't have a mobile phone or have a computer, I could be&#160;... a dinosaur.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Exactly. Let's hear some examples.</td></tr>
	<tr><td/><td class="examples">My grandfather just bought his first digital camera. I've been telling him to get one for years! He's a dinosaur when it comes to modern technology.</td></tr>
	<tr><td/><td class="examples">A: Have you met Jane's new husband</em><em>?
<br />B: Yes, he talks like someone from the 1930s. Really old-fashioned!</em><em>
<br />A: I know, he said he hates modern technology.</em><em>
<br />B: Oh, he's such a dinosaur.</td></tr><p>
<br /><strong>Helen:</strong> So calling someone a dinosaur means they're not in touch with the modern world.
<table border="0">
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Yes, a bit old-fashioned, maybe conservative in their thinking, and not keen for new challenges.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> Well, I love modern technology.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Are you on Facebook? Twitter? Instagram?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> No, what are these?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Oh dear, Helen! You really are a dinosaur!
<br />
<br />(sfx roar!)</td></tr>
