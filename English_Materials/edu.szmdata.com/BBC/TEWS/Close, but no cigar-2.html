<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>It's illegal to smoke inside the BBC, but Neil risks his job to teach you an English expression. Can Feifei guess what it is?</p>
<h3>Transcript</h3>


<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Hello and welcome to The English We Speak, I'm Neil and joining me is Feifei&hellip;</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Hi there everyone.</p>


<p><strong>Neil</strong>
<br /> In this programme we have an expression you can use when someone has almost succeeded&#151;but not quite. Now Feifei, could you just pass me that lighter, please?</p>


<p><strong>Feifei</strong>
<br /> Lighter? What on earth are you doing with that cigar? You can't smoke in here!</p>


<p><strong>Neil</strong>
<br /> It's a clue. You have to guess what the expression is.</p>


<p><strong>Feifei</strong>
<br /> Oh OK. Is it 'to smoke like a chimney?'</p>


<p><strong>Neil</strong>
<br /> Close, but no cigar.</p>


<p><strong>Feifei</strong>
<br /> OK, is it 'no smoke without fire'?</p>


<p><strong>Neil</strong>
<br /> Close, but no cigar.</p>


<p><strong>Feifei</strong>
<br /> Oh, I give up!</p>


<p><strong>Neil</strong>
<br /> I've told you twice already&#151;it's 'close, but no cigar.' If someone almost succeeds&#151;but not quite&#151;you can say to them 'close, but no cigar.' Here are some examples.</p>


<p><strong>Examples<br /></strong>A: How old do you think I am?</p>

<p>B: 36?</p>

<p>A: Nope&#151;35. Close, but no cigar.</p>

<p>Five of my numbers came up in the lottery. Close, but no cigar.</p>

<p>They hit the post in the last second of the game. Close, but no cigar!</p>


<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>So, there we go. If someone almost succeeds, but doesn't quite, we can say to them 'close, but no cigar.'</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Right, well you can put that cigar away now we've finished.</p>


<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Actually, it's a really good one&#151;shame to waste it.</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Neil!</p>


<p><strong>Neil</strong>
<br /> Uh oh!</p>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<p></p>
