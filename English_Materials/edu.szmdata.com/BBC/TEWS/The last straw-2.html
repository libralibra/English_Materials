<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>Something as light and harmless as a single straw could break something as solid as friendship? Well, it can happen. Listen to the programme to find out what the phrase mean.</p>
<h3>Transcript</h3>


<p><strong>Neil</strong>
<br />Hello and welcome to The English We Speak from BBC Learning English. I'm Neil.</p>


<p><strong>Helen</strong>
<br />Hello, I'm Helen. Neil, can I ask you about something?</p>


<p><strong>Neil</strong>
<br />Yeah, sure. What's on your mind?</p>


<p><strong>Helen</strong>
<br />Well, Theodora and Alma are my best friends, but they are not talking to each other because of a straw.</p>


<p><strong>Neil</strong>
<br />They are not getting on because of a straw? Are you sure you heard it right?</p>


<p><strong>Helen</strong>
<br />Yes, Alma said to me when Theodora didn't come to her party, it was the last straw. I don't understand. What could a straw do?</p>


<p><strong>Neil</strong>
<br />Oh, Alma was just using an expression. What she really meant was, things were not going well between them because of things that had happened in the past.</p>


<p><strong>Helen</strong>
<br />Well Theodora did miss quite a few of our gatherings.</p>


<p><strong>Neil</strong>
<br />When Theodora didn't come to Alma's party, that was the final thing that made Alma really angry, giving up on their friendship.</p>


<p><strong>Helen</strong>
<br />Oh, I see, so the last straw means the last thing or event that caused the total melt down.</p>


<p><strong>Neil</strong>
<br />That's right, we often hear the phrase 'the last straw', when people are talking about repeated problems or issues that aren't getting better, then the smallest thing happens, people finally lose their composure and explode.</p>


<p><strong>Helen</strong>
<br />I see.</p>


<p><strong>Neil</strong>
<br />Let's hear how it's used.</p>


<p><strong>Examples</strong>
<br />A: I've never seen you so angry.
<br />B: I have had such a bad day. I woke up late and rushed out of the house, then missed my bus by seconds, got in to work and was told there would be no pay rise this year. When the dinner lady said I put too much salad on my plate, it was the last straw.</p>

<p>The paper factory has struggled to stay open in the last few years; the new tax charge was the last straw, forcing it to shut down after 30 years in business.</p>


<p><strong>Neil</strong>
<br />Just so you know. Some people also say 'the final straw', and it means the same as 'the last straw'.</p>


<p><strong>Helen</strong>
<br />Thanks for the clarification. I do hope my friends can resolve their differences. Friendship is worth saving.</p>


<p><strong>Neil</strong>
<br />Absolutely.</p>


<p><strong>Both</strong>
<br />Bye.</p>
