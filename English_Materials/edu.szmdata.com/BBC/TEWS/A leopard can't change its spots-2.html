	<tr><td class="roles">Jennifer:</td><td> Hello, I'm Jennifer and this is The English We Speak. I'm with Feifei, and we're here at the zoo!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> Hi there everyone. Yes, the sun is out, so we thought we would come and take a look at some of our favourite animals. We've already seen the elephants and penguins&#151;I love the penguins, they're so funny.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Jennifer:</td><td> Well we're moving on now to my favourites&#151;the big cats!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> According to this leaflet, they have lions, tigers, pumas and leopards!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Jennifer:</td><td> Fantastic&#151;I love leopards. They're so beautiful and they also feature in one of my favourite phrases in English.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> Let me guess, it's "a leopard can't change its spots"?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Jennifer:</td><td> Absolutely, Feifei. The phrase "a leopard can't change its spots" is used to describe a person's character, particularly if they have some bad habits.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> Just as a leopard can't change the spots on its fur, a person can't change their personality, even if they say they have. It's part of them.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Jennifer:</td><td> Let's hear some examples of how you might use this phrase.</td></tr>
</table>
<ul>
	<li>John promised me that he would stay out of trouble at school, but I don't believe him. A leopard can't change its spots.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Katie used to have a reputation for gossiping and spreading rumours. I've heard she's changed now, but I don't trust her: a leopard can't change its spots.</li>
</ul><p>
<br /><strong>Feifei:</strong> Great phrase. Let's see if we can find a real life leopard then!
<table border="0">
	<tr><td class="roles">Jennifer:</td><td> Well, the big cat area is over there, according to this map. Oh look! I can see lions&#160;... They have little baby ones too&#160;... Ah! But where are the leopards?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> Er, Jen&#160;...&#160;</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Jennifer:</td><td> They must be here somewhere, a big spotty cat like that can't be too hard to find.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> (whispering) Jen, I think you should&#160;...&#160;</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Jennifer:</td><td> Hurry, they must be this way. I want to see a leopard right now! A leopard can't change its spots and I can't change the fact that it's my favourite animal in the whole wide world!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> I think you should turn around!
<br />
<br />(huge growl and roar)</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Jennifer:</td><td> (terrified) Oh. Hello Mr Leopard. You're a lot bigger in real life&#160;...&#160;</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> (whispering) Join us again for another edition of The English We Speak from BBC Learning English&#160;... Bye!
<br />
<br />(roar)</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Jennifer:</td><td> Here kitty, kitty, kitty. Nice kitty&#160;...&#160;
<br />
<br />(roar)</td></tr>
