	<tr><td class="roles">Jennifer:</td><td>Hello, and welcome to The English We Speak from BBC Learning English. I'm Jennifer, and with me in the studio today is Rob.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Hi there!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Jennifer:</td><td> In this programme, we teach you about English words or phrases that you might find a little confusing.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>&#160;</td><td class="stageDescriptions">(Phone text message sound)</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Jennifer:</td><td> Rob! You shouldn't have your phone switched on in the studio! It's not professional!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Sorry Jen, it's just a text message&#160;... It's from my friend&#151;I made her a cake for her birthday.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Jennifer:</td><td> That's very kind of you. Is she texting you to say thank you?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Well&#160;... actually&#160;... no! In fact, I think she's angry at me!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Jennifer:</td><td> What do you mean?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Let me read it out. Her message said: "I'm supposed to be on a diet&#151;don't make me any more delicious cakes ever again!" I think I've really upset her!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Jennifer:</td><td> Are you sure you've read it correctly?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Yes! She's upset, I'm a bad friend&#151;what should I do?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Jennifer:</td><td> Hold on, let me have a look at the message&#151;pass your phone over.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> OK, here you go.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Jennifer:</td><td> It says "I'm supposed to be on a diet&#151;don't make me any more delicious cakes ever again&#160;...&#160;" Ah, I understand now. I don't think your friend is cross with you.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Really, why not?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Jennifer:</td><td> Look at the text message. Do you see that she has written the letters L.O.L.&#151;or LOL&#151;at the end?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Oh yes! I didn't spot that&#160;... L.O.L. LOL. What does that mean?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Jennifer:</td><td> It's a good example of English 'text speak', that is, language people use when texting, writing emails or talking over the internet. LOL, or L.O.L. stands for 'laughing out loud'.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Laughing out loud?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Jennifer:</td><td> Yes, it's used instead of the sound of laughter. Itâ€™s usually used to show that something is a joke, or that a comment is meant to be funny&#151;so your friend was joking when she said "don't make me any more delicious cakes!"</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Phew! That's a relief. So I can write LOL on the end of a message, to let people know that I'm laughing or joking about something?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Jennifer:</td><td> That's right.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Right! I'm going to practise. Let me send you a message. (Typing on phone) Sent!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Jennifer:</td><td> (Text message sound) OK let me read it. "Hi Jen, I've decided that teaching English is too difficult. I'm going to teach Spanish instead, LOL!" I hope you're joking, Rob!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> (Laughing) You KNOW I'm joking, I wrote that I was 'laughing out loud'&#151;LOL&#151;at the end.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Jennifer:</td><td> Good, because we've got so many more words and phrases to learn in English before you can even <em>think</em> about any other languages! Join us again for another edition of The English We Speak, bye for now!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Bye!</td></tr>
