<p class="storyTitle">Hunky-dory</p>
<p>Helen: Hi, I'm Helen, and welcome to The English We Speak. Sorry, I'll be with you in a minute, Chris&#151;I'm just on the phone to Rob&#160;...&#160;
<br />
<br />Chris: Sure.
<br />
<br />Helen: Rob, do you need me to come and record with you in the studio this afternoon?
<br />
<br />Rob: No, don't worry&#151;I've got Neil coming over to record with me. Everything's hunky-dory.
<br />
<br />Helen: Everything's wha-?
<br />
<br />Rob: Gotta go. Speak to you later&#151;bye!
<br />
<br />Helen: OK, b-&#160;...&#160;Oh, he hung up.
<br />
<br />Chris: Having a busy day, Helen?
<br />
<br />Helen: Yes, it's been so busy&#151;I've got to move all these boxes. How is your day going?
<br />
<br />Chris: No problems really. I've finished my script and I've already recorded another programme with Rosie&#160;... I'm hunky-dory.
<br />
<br />Helen: Hunky-dory? That's what Rob just said to me. Neither of you is very hunky though&#160;...&#160;
<br />
<br />Chris: What?!
<br />
<br />Helen: Well, hunky means muscular doesn't it?
<br />
<br />Chris: Well yes, hunky is a slang word for describing someone who is muscular&#160;...&#160;
<br />
<br />Helen: So, you're not telling the truth when you say, 'I'm hunky&#160;... Dory'. My name's not 'Dory' though&#151;why do you call me that?
<br />
<br />Chris: I wasn't lying and saying 'I'm hunky'&#160;...&#160;and I wasn't calling you 'Dory' either. The phrase hunky-dory doesn't have anything to do with being muscular&#151;it's an informal way of saying something's fine or satisfactory.
<br />
<br />Helen: Ohhhh&#160;... It's a bit of a strange phrase though.
<br />
<br />Chris: Yes, it is. No-one really knows where it comes from, other than it's believed to be an American phrase.
<br />Helen: I see. So how can you use it?
<br />
<br />Chris: Well, here are some examples:</p>
<ul>
	<li><em>I was really worried I'd lost her, but everything's hunky-dory now&#151;she was waiting for me by the car.</em></li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><em>Our washing machine broke last night. An engineer is coming to take a look at it today, so it should be hunky-dory soon.</em></li>
</ul><p>Chris: So you can use hunky-dory as an informal way to say that a situation is fine.
<br />
<br />Helen: Now I understand!&#160;...&#160;Well, sadly nothing is hunky-dory for me&#160;... I've got all these boxes to move.
<br />
<br />Chris: Is that why you invited me here?
<br />
<br />Helen: Maybe&#160;...&#160;?
<br />
<br />Chris: Hmm&#160;... right then, let's get on with it. Right, where do you want them?
<br />
<br />Helen: Just over there, thanks.
<br />
<br />Chris: OK&#160;...&#160;
<br />
<br />Helen: Haha! My work will soon be done!&#160;...&#160;Join us again for another edition of The English We Speak and visit our website, bbclearningenglish.com. Bye!</p>
