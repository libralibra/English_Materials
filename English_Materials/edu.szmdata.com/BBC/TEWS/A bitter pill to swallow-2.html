<h3><strong>Summary</strong></h3>

<p>Helen's not happy about a decision that's been made and Rob tries to offer some sympathy with a strange idiom that involves swallowing something that doesn't taste very nice. Find out what he means in the programme.<strong><br /></strong></p>
<h3><strong>Transcript</strong></h3>


<p><strong>Feifei</strong>
<br />Hello and welcome to The English We Speak. I'm Feifei and joining me today is Rob.</p>


<p><strong>Rob</strong>
<br />Hi everyone&hellip; errr, Feifei are you OK? You don't sound as cheerful as normal.</p>


<p><strong>Feifei</strong>
<br />I feel terrible today&#151;I've got a headache, feel really tired&hellip; I think I'm developing flu. I'm going to take these paracetamol tablets.</p>


<p><strong>Rob</strong>
<br />Hold on Feifei. Are you sure you're getting flu? This hasn't got anything to do with that job promotion you didn't get?</p>


<p><strong>Feifei</strong>
<br />Of course not&hellip; well maybe a little.</p>


<p><strong>Rob</strong>
<br />Hmm, I know you wanted that promotion so much but Daisy got it instead didn't she?</p>


<p><strong>Feifei</strong>
<br />Exactly&#151;and I've been working here much longer than her and I have loads more experience. It's so unfair!</p>


<p><strong>Rob</strong>
<br />I know&hellip; it's a bitter pill to swallow.</p>


<p><strong>Feifei</strong>
<br />Thanks for the advice but even if these tablets&#151;or pills&#151;are bitter, they'll make me feel better&#151;now can you show me some more sympathy about my promotion please?</p>


<p><strong>Rob</strong>
<br />I was Feifei! When I said 'it's a bitter pill to swallow' I really meant it's a situation that is unpleasant and difficult to accept.</p>


<p><strong>Feifei</strong>
<br />OK, I see! You're saying I'm finding Daisy's promotion hard to accept?</p>


<p><strong>Rob</strong>
<br />It's tough Feifei but that's the way things are. Let's hear some more examples of this phrase in action&hellip;</p>


<p><strong>Examples</strong>
<br />When John found out about his wife's affair with his best friend, it was a bitter pill to swallow.</p>

<p>It was a bitter pill to swallow knowing that my older sister finished the race quicker than me.</p>

<p>My friend has booked the same flights as me for half the price&#151;it's a bitter pill to swallow!</p>


<p><strong>Feifei</strong>
<br />So 'a bitter pill to swallow' means I don't like what's happened but I will have to accept it? Hmm, I like the phrase but it doesn't make me feel any better.</p>


<p><strong>Rob</strong>
<br />You'll just have to swallow the decision Feifei! Daisy is going to be your boss now.</p>


<p><strong>Feifei</strong>
<br />Oh dear&hellip; I think my flu might be getting worse now&hellip; I'm definitely going to take these paracetamol now&hellip; Yuk, that really was bitter!</p>


<p><strong>Rob</strong>
<br />I think two tablets are enough for now Feifei. Maybe you should take tomorrow off work.</p>


<p><strong>Feifei</strong>
<br />What a great idea Rob. See you later.</p>


<p><strong>Rob</strong>
<br />Bye!</p>
