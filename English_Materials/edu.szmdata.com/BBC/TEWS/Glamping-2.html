	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> And I'm Feng Feifei. Neil you're looking very relaxed and healthy today.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Neil:</td><td> Oh, thanks Feifei, I've just come back from a camping holiday actually.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> A camping holiday?! Most people come back from camping looking like they need another holiday because of the lack of comfortable facilities!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Neil:</td><td> Ah, well actually I cheated. I went glamping.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> Glamping?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Neil:</td><td> Yes, glamping. Although I was staying in a tent, it was already set up when we arrived at the campsite, we slept on proper beds and even had a kitchen with a cooker and fridge.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> Wow, that sounds more glamorous than camping!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Neil:</td><td> Exactly! Glamorous camping. Put those two words together and you get&#160;...&#160;</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Both:</td><td> Glamping.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> Oh I see&#160;... glamping is a word made up of two words: glamorous&#160;...&#160;</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Neil:</td><td> And camping.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> It's glamorous because there are lots of facilities you don't normally get in a tent, such as proper beds and even a kitchen.
<br />
<br /><span><strong>Example</strong></span>
	<tr><td/><td class="examples">A: I really hate camping&#160;... It reminds me of miserable holidays as a kid, sleeping on a cold, wet floor and eating horrible food!</td></tr>
</p><p><em>B: You should try glamping. You get to spend time in the great outdoors but in a proper bed and with nice meals! It's wonderful!</em></td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> So do people really use this word 'glamping'?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Neil:</td><td> Yes, it's quite a new word and a bit of a joke, but you can read it and you do hear people use it because there are more and more companies offering glamping holidays.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> Hmm&#160;...&#160;</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Neil:</td><td> What's up Feifei? I know you're a city girl, but wouldn't you like to try glamping?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> I'm not sure about that&#160;... Is there room service?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Neil:</td><td> Room service?! That's a step too far! I'm afraid that's too glamorous for glamping!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> OK, how about a spa and massage room?!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Neil:</td><td> Spa and massage room?! Honestly, it's still camping. Bye for now.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> Ha ha! Bye!<strong><br /></strong></td></tr>
