<table border="0">
	<tr><td class="roles">Kaz:</td><td>Hello I'm Kaz.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Yang&#160;Li:</td><td> And I'm Yang Li. Hey Kaz I see you have brought some guests to the studio.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Kaz:</td><td> Indeed I have. Li I'd like you to meet Tom&#160;... Dick&#160;... and Harry.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">TDH:</td><td> How do you do?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Yang&#160;Li:</td><td> How do you do. It's always nice to meet new people Kaz, but I suspect these young men are here for a reason. Am I right?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Kaz:</td><td> Yes Li I've invited them because their names are Tom, Dick and Harry.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Yang&#160;Li:</td><td> Tom, Dick and Harry. Three popular English names&#151;connected to a popular phrase by any chance Kaz?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Kaz:</td><td> Absolutely right Li. Our phrase today is 'every Tom, Dick and Harry'.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Yang&#160;Li:</td><td> 'Every Tom, Dick and Harry'&#151;meaning everyone with a common name I suppose.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Kaz:</td><td> Yes, In English if you want to talk about lots of unspecified people you can use the phrase 'every Tom, Dick and Harry'.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Yang&#160;Li:</td><td> So it's like saying 'everyone', right?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Kaz:</td><td> That's right but it's more informal and slightly humorous.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Yang&#160;Li:</td><td> OK, I think you should demonstrate its use Kaz.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Kaz:</td><td> Good idea Li. Imagine I tell you something in confidence, in private&#160;... I could ask you not to repeat it.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Yang&#160;Li:</td><td> Because we don't want everyone knowing about it.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Kaz:</td><td> Exactly. We don't want every Tom, Dick and Harry knowing about it.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Yang&#160;Li:</td><td> We don't want every Tom, Dick and Harry knowing our secret Kaz.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Kaz:</td><td> You've got it Li!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Yang&#160;Li:</td><td> OK, let's listen to some more examples:</td></tr>
	<tr><td/><td class="examples">Shhhhh! Lower your voice! We don't want every Tom, Dick and Harry to hear us.</td></tr>
	<tr><td/><td class="examples">Make sure you send out invitations, otherwise you'll have every Tom, Dick and Harry showing up at your party.</td></tr>
<ul>
	<li><em>Whatever you do, don't tell Doug. He can't keep a secret and soon every Tom, Dick and Harry will know about it.</em></li>
</ul>
<table border="0">
	<tr><td class="roles">Yang&#160;Li:</td><td> Those three names are interesting and each is a short form of a longer name. I know Tom is the diminutive of Thomas and Harry is short for Harold. But what's Dick short for?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Kaz:</td><td> Dick is short for Richard.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Yang&#160;Li:</td><td> Ah yes, of course, Dick is short for Richard. So what's Kaz short for?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Kaz:</td><td> We don't need to know that Li.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Yang&#160;Li:</td><td> Why not Kaz?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Kaz:</td><td> Because we are very unlikely to ever say 'every Kaz, Dick and Harry'.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Yang&#160;Li:</td><td> Very funny Kaz but it's time to say goodbye to our guests 'Tom, Dick and Harry'. So, goodbye chaps!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">TDH:</td><td> Goodbye!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Kaz:</td><td> And it's goodbye from us.</td></tr>

<br /><strong>Kaz/Yang Li:</strong> Bye!</p>
