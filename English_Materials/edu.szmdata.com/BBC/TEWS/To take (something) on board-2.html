	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Hello I'm Li, welcome to The English We Speak and today I'm at the airport with Rob. So Rob, here we are, about to fly off on a holiday of a lifetime.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Hmm, yes, but I don't think you'll be flying anywhere with those things in your hand-luggage.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Why? What's wrong with this giant bottle of suntan cream&#151;it was cheaper than buying a small one.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> You can't take that on board&#151;it's more than 100 millilitres&#151;you won't get through security.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Oh, I can't take that much liquid on board a plane.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> And what do you need that penknife for?!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> In case I need to peel an apple?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Li! You can't take that on board either!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Oh.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Honestly Li, don't you ever read the notices? Look, it says here, no sharp objects and no large bottles of liquid. I really think you need to do some preparation before you fly.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Do some preparation? Oh OK, I'll take that on board.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Don't be stupid, you can't actually take 'preparation' on board. It's only objects&#160;... things&#160;... that you take 'on board' a plane, or a bus&#160;... or even a train.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Rob, it's a phrase. "I'll take that on board". It means I will understand or accept a piece of information. So I'm not physically moving it.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> But you could say you're moving some information into your brain?!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> I suppose so, but I think these examples will illustrate the phrase better&#160;...&#160;</td></tr>
	<tr><td/><td class="examples">If that shop wants to succeed it needs to take on board the views of all its customers.</td></tr>
	<tr><td/><td class="examples">My brain aches! I need to take on board so many concepts and ideas if I'm going to pass this exam.</td></tr>
<ul>
	<li><em>Drivers are beginning to take on board the safety message that speeding kills.</em></li>
</ul>
<table border="0">
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> So there are some examples of using the phrase 'to take on board'&#151;you understand or accept some information&#151;so Rob, have you taken on board the meaning of this phrase?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Absolutely. And have you taken on board the safety and security information?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Of course&#151;so I'll just put these items in the bin. Gone.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Right, our flight's ready for boarding now.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Good&#160;... but I've got a very large handbag. Would you mind carrying it on for me?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Sure Li&#160;... Oh, Li, this is extremely heavy. Ouch. This is something you really won't take on board.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Oh really?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Yes. Your handbag can't weigh any more than 15 kilograms.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> I see. More information that I'll take on board!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Good, next time remember what I've told you before you get to the airport. Come on we'd better go home. Bye for now.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> See you next time for The English We Speak from BBC Learning English. Bye.</td></tr>
