<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>Neil and Feifei catch a train in order to teach a useful expression often heard in the office environment. Going backwards makes Feifei feel sick but luckily this expression is all about going forward.</p>


<p><strong>Neil</strong>
<br />Hello, I'm Neil and welcome to The English We Speak, which this week comes from a train.</p>


<p><strong>Feifei</strong>
<br />Hi I'm Feifei. That's right, we've got on a train in order to teach you a useful English expression, which has become very common&#151;particularly in a work environment.</p>


<p><strong>Neil</strong>
<br />I love trains, Feifei&#151;racing through the countryside, looking out of the window. Ah, it's great&#151;you can't beat it! Oh&#151;are you OK, Feifei? You look a bit&hellip; green.</p>


<p><strong>Feifei</strong>
<br />Well it's OK for you, Neil, but I've got the backward-facing seat. It makes me feel sick. Going forward, can you avoid booking me the backward-facing seat?</p>


<p><strong>Neil</strong>
<br />Of course! Going forward I'll get you a forward-facing seat.</p>


<p><strong>Feifei</strong>
<br />(sounding sick) 'Going forward' is another way of saying 'in the future'.</p>


<p><strong>Neil</strong>
<br />That's right. You'll hear 'going forward' used at business meetings when a person wants someone to change the way they do something in the future.</p>


<p><strong>Feifei</strong>
<br />Here are some examples.</p>


<p><strong>Examples</strong>
<br />A: Did you get the files I emailed over?
<br />B: Yes I did, but going forward can you send hard copies in the post? We need them for our records.</p>

<p>Boss: I've noticed you chatting on your mobile quite a lot during the working day. Going forward, can you keep the private conversations to your lunch breaks?</p>

<p>A: Going forward we will only have an online version of our newspaper. The days of print are dead.</p>


<p><strong>Feifei</strong>
<br />So there you go. People speaking in an office environment use 'going forward' to mean in the future, from this point.</p>


<p><strong>Neil</strong>
<br />I quite like doing The English We Speak recordings from the train. Going forward, shall we record all our programmes from vehicles?</p>


<p><strong>Feifei</strong>
<br />Hmm, not sure about that. I get terrible travel sickness.</p>


<p><strong>Neil</strong>
<br />Well, going forward, I recommend you take these pills (hands bottle of pills over).</p>


<p><strong>Feifei</strong>
<br />Urgh&hellip;</p>


<p><strong>Neil</strong>
<br />Goodbye!</p>


<p><strong>Feifei</strong>
<br />Bye!</p>
