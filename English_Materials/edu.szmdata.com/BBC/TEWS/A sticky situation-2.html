<h3>Transcript</h3>

<p>Note: This is not a word-for-word transcript</p>

<p><strong>Feifei<br></strong>Welcome to The English We Speak with me Feifei and&#160;... Rob&#160;... Rob? Where's Rob?</p>

<p><strong>Rob</strong> <br>(Door opens) Oh hi Feifei&#160;... you couldn't lend me £10, could you?</p>

<p><strong>Feifei <br></strong>Rob! You're supposed to be presenting this programme. Anyway, what do you need £10 for? And what's that&#160;... stuff all over your clothes?</p>

<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>Well, I was running to get to the studio and I bumped into a woman.</p>

<p><strong>Feifei<br></strong>Right&#160;... So, what do you need £10 for?</p>

<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>Well, you see, she dropped a big box she was carrying and said I would have to pay for the damage&#151;and if I didn't, her daughter would be really upset!</p>

<p><strong>Feifei<br></strong>Oh! Rob, you are in 'a sticky situation'.</p>

<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>Well, that's true. You mean I'm in a situation that is difficult to get out of?</p>

<p><strong>Feifei<br></strong>Exactly! Rob, here's £10&#151;now you can go and un-stick the situation!</p>

<p><strong>Rob</strong> <br>Thanks Feifei. I think we should hear some examples of this phrase while I go and pay the woman&#160;...&#160;</p>

<p><strong>Examples<br></strong>I'm in a sticky situation: I said I'd go to the cinema with Pete but I've also promised to go for a drink with John.</p>
<p>It was a sticky situation&#151;neither side would agree on who caused the accident.</p>
<p>We're in a sticky situation&#151;we've got to catch the train but we haven't got enough money to buy a ticket.</p>

<p><strong>Feifei<br></strong>So a sticky situation is a difficult, awkward or sensitive situation. (Door opens again) Ah, Rob, you're back&#160;...&#160;</p>

<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>&#160;...&#160;yes. She's happy now and is going back to the bakery again.</p>

<p><strong>Feifei<br></strong>The bakery? Why? What was in that box she was carrying?</p>

<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>It was a big birthday cake for her daughter.</p>

<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br>Oh no&#151;you were in a sticky situation in more ways than one!</p>

<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>I suppose I was.</p>

<p><strong>Both<br></strong>Bye.</p>
