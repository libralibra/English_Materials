<p><strong>Finn<br clear="none"></strong>Hi, Feifei. Fancy a lift to the office?</p>
<p><strong>Feifei<br clear="none"></strong>Hello, Finn. Sorry, I'm not actually going in to the office today. I'm taking care of my niece.</p><p>(Baby talking)</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br clear="none"></strong>Oh, what a sweet baby!</p>
<p><strong>Feifei<br clear="none"></strong>Isn't she adorable? You know, I'm thinking about becoming a full-time babysitter!</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br clear="none"></strong>Oh, really?</p>
<p><strong>Feifei<br clear="none"></strong>Hang on, Finn. (To the baby) Time for your bath, little one!</p><p>(Baby laughs)</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br clear="none"></strong>But Feifei, you don't actually want to change your job, do you?</p>
<p><strong>Feifei<br clear="none"></strong>Well, I enjoy my job. But sometimes, you know, it can be very stressful. I feel like a change&#160;...&#160;</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br clear="none"></strong>Really? But you're so good at your job! I know how you love completing projects. And we'd all miss you so much.</p>
<p><strong>Feifei<br clear="none"></strong>I know. But dealing with babies is so much easier.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br clear="none"></strong>Well, just don't throw the baby out with the bathwater, Feifei.</p>
<p><strong>Feifei<br clear="none"></strong>What do you mean?! I know how to take care of a baby. Why would I throw her out?</p><p>(Baby crying)</p>
<p><strong>Feifei<br clear="none"></strong>See what you've done.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br clear="none"></strong>Sorry! 'Don't throw the baby out with the bathwater' is an English idiom which means: 'don't lose something valuable while we're getting rid of something else that we don't want'. So I was talking about your job, Feifei. Just because you find it stressful&#151;that's the thing you don't want&#151;don't stop completely and lose what's valuable.</p>
<p><strong>Feifei<br clear="none"></strong>Ah, I see. So you think my job gives me satisfaction, in spite of the long hours in the office… so I shouldn't give it up.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br clear="none"></strong>That's right. 'Don't throw the baby out with the bathwater' is the expression in this edition of The English We Speak. Now let's hear some examples of how it's used.</p>
<p><strong>Examples</strong></p><p>I know you don't like the dress, but I think if you make a few changes to it, it will look lovely. It's such beautiful material. Don't throw the baby out with the bathwater.</p><p>Don't throw the baby out with the bathwater. I know the wallpaper is ugly, but this is a lovely house. We can always redecorate.</p>
<p><strong>Feifei<br clear="none"></strong>Thank you, Finn. Having colleagues like you who care for me is so important. You know what? I don't want to be a babysitter after all.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br clear="none"></strong>That's the spirit!</p>
<p><strong>Feifei<br clear="none"></strong>So… here's the baby and… well, the nappies are in that drawer.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br clear="none"></strong>Feifei, what do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>Feifei<br clear="none"></strong>Well, Finn, someone has to take care of the baby. I'm going to the office. See you later. Bye!</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br clear="none"></strong>And I'm left holding the baby… Bye!</p>
<p><strong>Baby<br clear="none"></strong>Ba… Ba…</p>
