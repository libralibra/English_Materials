<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>Hello, duck! Neil and Feifei bring you some unusual ways of greeting people, all of which are related to animals. Don't worry, they're all friendly ways to say hello!</p>
<h3>Transcript</h3>


<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong><em>(Makes sound of a duck)</em></p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Welcome to The English We Speak&hellip;</p>


<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong><em>(Makes sound of a duck)</em></p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Shh&hellip; Let me finish! Welcome to The English We Speak, the programme where we&hellip;</p>


<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong><em>(Makes sound of a duck)</em></p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Ok, ok&#151;you win, Neil. You start the programme.</p>


<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>OK&#151;welcome to The English We Speak. Today we bring you a way to say hello to people that involves&hellip; ducks.</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Finally. English is, of course, a rich and diverse language, and different regions use different expressions. In the English Midlands&#151;the area around the city of Nottingham&#151;you'll hear this. Imagine I'm in a shop, and Neil is the shopkeeper:</p>


<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Hello duck, how can I help you?</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Hello duck&#151;'duck' here is a form of address&#151;a word you use when politely speaking to someone.</p>


<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>And 'duck' is an affectionate term for another person. So if you hear it&#151;please don't be offended&#151;it's a friendly thing to say.</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Some think that it comes from the word 'duke'! Let's hear a few examples:</p>


<p><strong>Examples<br /></strong>Come over here and tell me what the problem is, duck.</p>

<p>Don't you worry about that broken glass, duck. I'll sort it out.</p>


<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>'Duck' is generally used by people talking to those younger than or the same age as themselves. In some ways it functions like the word &lsquo;dear'.</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>But it's not a phrase that all native English speakers use. When Hollywood actress Angelina Jolie used it when presenting an award to an English actor from the East Midlands, Jack O'Connoll, it confused a lot of people around the world!</p>


<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>And what's more, 'duck' is not the only form of address based on animals. For example, where might someone call you&hellip; hen?</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>'Hen' is used in Glasgow&#151;but only when talking to women.</p>


<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Alright hen? And then we have 'pet'&hellip;</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>'Pet' is used in the North East of England&#151;around Newcastle people call each other 'pet'.</p>


<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Thanks, pet. So&#151;listen out for these different regional ways of being friendly&#151;just don't be surprised if you confuse people when you use them yourself! Thanks for listening.</p>
