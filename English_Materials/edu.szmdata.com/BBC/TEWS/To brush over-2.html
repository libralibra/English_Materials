	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> I'm trying&#160;... but Rob, what are you doing up a ladder anyway?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> I'm decorating!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Why?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Well this studio is really scruffy&#151;you know, not that smart&#151;so I thought I'd tidy it up and paint it, too.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Hmmm. I don't think it's a good idea.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Why?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> For a start, you haven't put any sheets down to stop the paint splashing on the carpet,&#160;...&#160;and you need to move the chairs outside&#160;... you're wearing smart clothes, not ones for decorating in.</td></tr>

	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Brush over? You can't brush over those things&#151;you'll get paint everywhere!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> No, Li! When you say you will 'brush over' something, it means you will ignore it or not take it that seriously.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> I see. So Rob, you're saying making the preparations for decorating is not important and you're going to ignore it?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Well&#160;... I'm in a rush.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> I see. Let's hear some examples, shall we?</td></tr>
	<tr><td/><td class="examples">My teacher's history lesson was fascinating, but he brushed over World War I and that was the bit I wanted to hear about most!</td></tr>
	<tr><td/><td class="examples">We haven't sorted the figures for the meeting, but we'll brush over those and just talk about the future.</td></tr>

	<li><em>How old am I? Well, let's just brush over that and say I'm as old as I feel!</em></li>
</ul>
<table border="0">
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> So, to 'brush over' something means to ignore something or miss it out. Rob, have you actually asked for permission to decorate this studio? It doesn't belong to you.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Well&#160;... err&#160;...&#160;</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Are you brushing over that, too?! Anyway, even if you did get permission, shouldn't you cover up the windows?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> That's true, Li. But before I do any of that, there is something more important to do.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Oh yes?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Buy some paintbrushes!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Ah yes, you can't brush over that!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Both:</td><td> Bye.</td></tr>
