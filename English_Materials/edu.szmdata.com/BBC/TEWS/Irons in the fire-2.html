	<tr><td class="roles">Jen:</td><td>Hello, I'm Jennifer. Welcome to The English We Speak. Joining me in the studio today is Helen. Hi Helen!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td>Hi Jen! I wasn't expecting to see you in the office today; I thought you were on leave?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Jen:</td><td>No, that's next week. I'm taking two weeks off work and I can't wait!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> Are you going on holiday?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Jen:</td><td>I haven't planned anything just yet, but I do have a few irons in the fire that will keep me busy across the fortnight.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td>Irons in the fire? What do you mean? When did you become an ironmonger?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Jen:</td><td> No, Helen, I'm not an ironmonger&#160;...&#160;</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td>&#160;...&#160;because that could be great! I saw a lovely wrought-iron bed in a shop in London, but it was too expensive&#160;... Perhaps with your new iron-making skills you can make me one, instead!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Jen:</td><td>I definitely don't have any iron-making skills!</td></tr>	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td>But you said you had a few irons in the fire&#160;... Oh! I suppose you mean that you've got a lot of ironing to do; you do wear a lot of different clothes so I suppose it would take a long time to iron them all&#160;...&#160;</td></tr>	<tr><td class="roles">Jen:</td><td>No, that's not what I meant!</td></tr>	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td>So what did you mean when you said you have 'a few irons in the fire'?</td></tr>	<tr><td class="roles">Jen:</td><td>This is another English phrase which you shouldn't take too literally. If you have a few irons in the fire, it means that you have a few different projects or potential ideas going on at the same time.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td>I see. So you have a few irons in the fire because you have different options for your fortnight off?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Jen:</td><td>That's right&#151;I can't wait.</td></tr>	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td>So tell me, Jen, what are your irons in the fire&#151;what are you planning?</td></tr>	<tr><td class="roles">Jen:</td><td>Well, I have a friend in Paris who I haven't seen for ages, so I could go there&#160;... I'd like to pop up to Scotland to visit my sister and her children for a few days&#160;... There's also a cheap deal to Turkey that I've seen and I already have some yoga classes booked in!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> Wow, that's a lot!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Jen:</td><td> There was one thing you <em>were</em> right about, though&#160;...&#160;</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> What's that?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Jen:</td><td> I do have a huge pile of ironing to do! Join us again for another edition of The English We Speak from bbclearningenglish.com. Bye for now!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> Bye!</td></tr>
