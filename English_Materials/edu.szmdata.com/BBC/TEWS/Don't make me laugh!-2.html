<p class="storyTitle">Don't make me laugh!</p>
<table border="0">
	<tr><td class="roles">Jennifer:</td><td> Hi I'm Jennifer and this is The English We Speak. In this programme, we teach you about English words or phrases which you might not find in the dictionary. Here comes Feifei.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> Hello Jen, hi everyone. Hey, Jen, I have some news for you.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Jennifer:</td><td> Oh yes, what is it?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> I was standing next to the water cooler, when I heard the boss talking. He said that he is going to give everyone at work a holiday! For free!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Jennifer:</td><td> A free holiday?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> Yes, I'm sure that's what he said.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Jennifer:</td><td> Oh, don't make me laugh!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> It does sound too good to be true. Jen said: "Don't make me laugh." In English, this is something you can say when you think something is not going to happen.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Jennifer:</td><td> And I don't think the boss is going to give us a holiday, especially a free one. The boss giving us special treats&#160;...&#160;? Don't make me laugh.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> Let's hear some more examples of this phrase.</td></tr>
</table>
<ul>
	<li>A: I heard that Justin Bieber is going to play a gig at our Christmas party!</li>
	<li>B: Don't make me laugh&#151;he's far too famous to come here.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>A: Do you think that the Scotland football team could win the World Cup one day?</li>
	<li>B: Don't make me laugh&#151;they've never won anything!</li>
</ul><p>
<br /><strong>Feifei:</strong> So, 'don't make me laugh' is a great way to say that you think something won't happen.
<table border="0">
	<tr><td class="roles">Jennifer:</td><td> Like our boss giving away free holidays. So I wonder what he did mean?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> Oooh, here's an email from him. It says: "I'm going away for two weeks. You will all need to work extra hard during this time, and don't call me&#151;I want a work-free holiday."</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Jennifer:</td><td> You see? I told you he wouldn't give away free holidays. He wants a work-free holiday: that means he doesn't want to think about work while he's away.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> Oh well. It seems I didn't hear him properly. It was nice while it lasted!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Jennifer:</td><td> So, are you planning to work 'extra hard' while he's away?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> Don't make me laugh! I'm not working hard, I'm going to take advantage and have a relaxing two weeks without the boss here!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Jennifer:</td><td> That sounds like a good plan. Join us again for another edition of The English We Speak from BBC Learning English. Bye for now!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> Bye!</td></tr>
