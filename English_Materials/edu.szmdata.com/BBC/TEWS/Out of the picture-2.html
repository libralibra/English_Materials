<p><em>(Finn is visiting Feifei)</em>
<table border="0">
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> Hi Finn. I am glad you could come to my house to take a picture of my special friend.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Finn:</td><td> My pleasure, Feifei. I take pride in being a great photographer. I brought some of my best pictures.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> Let me have a look.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Finn:</td><td> Yes. I took this one during a trip to Paris.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> I remember. The trip you took last summer with your girlfriend Ann.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Finn:</td><td> Oh, Ann&#160;... She is out of the picture. Look at the Eiffel Tower. I bet you've never seen it from this angle.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> And this other one&#160;...&#160;</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Finn:</td><td> Yes, yes. This other one I took at a dinner party in my flat.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> Yes, with your flatmate Johnny.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Finn:</td><td> My ex-flatmate "Dirty Socks" Johnny. He is out of the picture too.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> Finn, I can see him in this photo and&#160;... you keep talking about having your friends out of the picture&#160;... I want my friend to be in the picture!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Finn:</td><td> Oh, Feifei, no. Ann and Johnny appear in some of my snaps. But Ann is not my girlfriend anymore. She ran away with a Frenchman&#160;...&#160;</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> Oh&#160;... and what happened to Johnny?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Finn:</td><td> "Dirty Socks" Johnny moved out. He used to leave his socks everywhere!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> Oh, so you are no longer in touch with them.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Finn:</td><td> Exactly. In English, when we say someone is "out of the picture" we mean we don't count on them anymore. They are no longer involved in a particular situation. Let's hear some examples.</td></tr>

<ul>
	<li>Divorce was good for Mrs Jones. She looks very happy with her husband out of the picture.</li>
	<li>My team is bound to lose this weekend now that our best player is out of the picture. He broke his leg yesterday.</li>
</ul><p>
<br /><strong>Finn:</strong> So now that this is clear, where is your special someone? Shall we go out into the garden? The lighting is really good outside. I'll take a great picture!
<table border="0">
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> Follow me.

	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> Here's my special friend!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Finn:</td><td> But this&#160;... Feifei, this is a hamster!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Finn:</td><td> Yes! My pet's name is "Cutie Pie"! Oh my little sweetie, little friend! Isn't he cute, Finn?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Finn:</td><td> He is not very photogenic, I'm afraid, Feifei.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> Come on, Finn. Look at him! (to the hamster) Sweetie yummy come to mummy. You're going to be in the picture! Yes, you are!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Finn:</td><td> Oh dear! I can kiss goodbye to my career as a serious photographer&#160;...&#160;</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> Bye.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Finn:</td><td> Bye.</td></tr>
