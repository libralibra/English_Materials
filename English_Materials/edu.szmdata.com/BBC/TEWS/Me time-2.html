<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Hello and welcome to The English We Speak with me Feifei&hellip;</p>

<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>&hellip;and me Rob. Hello. But I'm afraid I won't be here for long Feifei.</p>

<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Why? What's happened, Rob?</p>

<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>I have so much to do. I have to write some texts, I am presenting this and two other programmes, and &hellip; yes, I have to upload material to our website&hellip;</p>

<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>That's a lot to do, and you look stressed.</p>

<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>And it's not just that&hellip; I have to take my son to school, my cat to the vet, buy my wife a birthday present&#160;...&#160;</p>

<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Rob, you need some 'me time'!</p>

<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Yes, I do! That would be brilliant! Me time is an expression which means time we have for ourselves to do just what we want. I really do need some me time.</p>

<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Let's hear some examples of how to use the expression 'me time'.</p>

<p><strong>Examples<br /></strong>I've just sent my mum to a spa in the countryside. She's been taking care of the whole family and is really in need of some me time!</p>
<p>A: Oh, six in the morning! I'm going to be late for work!
<br />B: Ignore the alarm clock today. It's Sunday! Stay in bed till late and have some me time.</p>

<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>You know, Rob, these examples have inspired me so much that I'll let you to have some me time for the rest of the programme.</p>

<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Really?!</p>

<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Yes. What do you like to do to relax?</p>

<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Well&hellip; I'd like to &hellip;</p>

<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Yes?</p>

<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>What I'd like, I'd really really like is&hellip; to take a nap. And now I'm going to do just that. OK. Thanks Feifei. Bye everyone!</p>

<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Rob? Rob?&#160;...&#160;Well, let's give Rob some me time. Bye!</p>
