<h3><strong><span>Summary</span></strong></h3>
<p>Finn wants to buy a sports car. But has he thought it through? Will he end up spending more money than he can afford? Listen to the programme to find out.</p><h3><strong><span>Transcript</span></strong></h3>
<p><em>(Feifei finds Finn in the company canteen)</em></p>
<p><strong>Feifei</strong></p><p>Hi Finn. What are you doing here sitting alone in the canteen? Can I sit with you?</p>
<p><strong>Finn</strong></p><p>Sure. Take a seat, Feifei.</p>
<p><strong>Feifei</strong></p><p>Mind if I take a chip? They look good.</p>
<p><strong>Finn</strong></p><p>Oh yeah, go ahead! I'm just eating this quickly as I'm going out soon, you know? I'm going to take a look at a car. It's a sports car! I've always wanted one.</p>
<p><strong>Feifei</strong></p><p>A sports car? Sounds expensive. How can you afford a sports car?</p>
<p><strong>Finn</strong></p><p>Well, it's a second-hand car. The owner needs to sell it quickly so they're selling it really cheaply. What a great opportunity, huh?!</p>
<p><strong>Feifei</strong></p><p>These sports cars burn a lot of fuel, you know, Finn. The <em>car</em> might come cheap but do you want to end up keeping it in a garage?</p>
<p><strong>Finn</strong></p><p>Well, I hadn't thought of that…</p>
<p><strong>Feifei</strong></p><p>And there's also insurance. A car like that will attract thieves, so it'll cost a lot…</p>
<p><strong>Finn</strong></p><p>That's right. You know… you've just given me some food for thought…</p>
<p><strong>Feifei</strong></p><p>Food? You want more food? I thought you wanted to finish eating quickly?</p>
<p><strong>Finn</strong></p><p>I'm not talking about real food. In English, when you say 'food for thought' you mean serious ideas or topics for us to think about.</p>
<p><strong>Feifei</strong></p><p>Nothing to do with chips, then?</p>
<p><strong>Finn</strong></p><p>No food involved. 'Food for thought' is today's expression in The English We Speak. Let's hear some examples of how it's used.</p><p><span><strong>Examples</strong></span></p><p><em>The football coach was really disappointed when his team lost 3-0 to an amateur side. But it gave him food for thought.</em></p><p><em>Mary's divorce gave her food for thought. She decided to go back to university, get a diploma, and change her life around.</em></p>
<p><strong>Feifei</strong></p><p>So Finn, are you going to buy this sports car?</p>
<p><strong>Finn</strong></p><p>I'm not so sure now. You have indeed given me food for thought.</p>
<p><strong>Feifei</strong></p><p>(<em>Chewing</em>)… Mmmm… these are good…</p>
<p><strong>Finn</strong></p><p>My chips! Feifei, you've taken all my chips?!</p>
<p><strong>Feifei</strong></p><p>Sorry Finn. They looked so good and I thought you were in a rush.</p>
<p><strong>Finn</strong></p><p>I was, until you gave me… food for thought!</p>
<p><strong>Feifei</strong></p><p>Ok&#151;let me get another plate. Chips are much better than sports cars anyway. Let's just focus on the eating today.</p>
<p><strong>Finn</strong></p><p>Yeah, and let's do the thinking another day! Bye.</p>
<p><strong>Feifei</strong></p><p>Bye.</p><p></p><h3>From the archives</h3>
