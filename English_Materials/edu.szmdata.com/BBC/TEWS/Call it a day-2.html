<table border="0">
	<tr><td class="roles">Jen:</td><td> Hello, and welcome to The English We Speak. I'm Jennifer, and with me in the studio is&#160;... yawn&#160;... Helen.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> Hi Jen&#160;... are you a bit tired?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Jen:</td><td> Oh yes, I really am. I've been here since seven this morning&#151;I think I'm ready to call it a day now.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> What do you want to call it? Monday? Tuesday?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Jen:</td><td> Oh no, I don't mean&#160;...&#160;</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> How about Saturday? That's my favourite day. Or we could call it a new day altogether. What about Cake-day! Or Coffee-day.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Jen:</td><td> I don't want to rename the day. In English, if you're ready to call it a day, it means that you want to finish whatever you're doing&#151;and usually go home.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> So you want to call it a day now? We haven't finished the programme yet.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Jen:</td><td> That's true. In that case, let's hear some examples of the phrase in action.</td></tr>

<ul>
	<li><em>We're getting nowhere with this&#151;shall we call it a day and start again tomorrow?</em></li>
	<li><em>I'm getting picked up from work at five, so I think I'd better call it a day.</em></li>
</ul><p>
<br /><strong>Helen:</strong> I see&#160;... so if you call it a day, you decide that it's time to finish the work you're doing.
<table border="0">
	<tr><td class="roles">Jen:</td><td> That's right, so let's call it a day right now.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> Alright then. Do you fancy a quick drink after work?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Jen:</td><td> Well, I'm feeling pretty tired, but I suppose I could come out for one drink.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> Let's go then!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Voice:</td><td> Some time later&#160;...&#160;
<br />
<br />(Nightclub music)</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> Jen, look at the time&#151;we've been here seven hours!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Jen:</td><td> I know! I don't know where the evening went. It's probably time to call it a night.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> I thought the phrase was 'call it a day'?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Jen:</td><td> We can also say 'call it a night' if you've been somewhere in the evening and you know it's time to go home.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> Well, I definitely think that you need to call it a night, then. Although look&#160;...&#160;</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Jen:</td><td> What?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> The sun is coming up already. We've been out on the town all night. Perhaps we should call it a day instead?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Jen:</td><td> That means it's nearly time for work again! Can I call in sick, please?</td></tr>
