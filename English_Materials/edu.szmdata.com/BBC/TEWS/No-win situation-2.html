<table border="0">
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Hello and welcome to The English We Speak. I'm Rob.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> And hello I'm Li.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Shh shh Li&#151;quiet please! I need to concentrate, the race is about to finish and I've got a bet on.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Yeah! I've won. I've actually won. I'm rich!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Well done Rob. So what have you won Rob?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Ten pounds!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Oh just ten pounds. Ah well, that's quite useful actually.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Is it. Why is that?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Well, you owe me five pounds and you did say you would buy me a glass of champagne if you won a race.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Oh right, did I? So, that will leave me with&#160;...&#160; fifty pence. Maybe I'm not a winner after all. Honestly! Every time I make some money I have to give it away.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Sorry Rob, it's a no-win situation or a lose-lose situation. Rob, you can't gain any money because you'll always lose it on something else.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> So even though I did win something, I have also lost. That's a no-win situation is it?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> I'm afraid it is. A no-win situation is one in which a favourable outcome is impossible. You are bound to lose whatever you do. You can also use this phrase to describe situations that aren't just to do with money, like this:</td></tr>
	<tr><td/><td class="examples">I can get the bus or train to work&#151;either way I'm going to be late. It's a no-win situation.</td></tr>
	<tr><td/><td class="examples">The cafe only served ham or beef sandwiches but as a vegetarian I was in a no-win situation.</td></tr>
<ul>
	<li><em>If she helps in the garden, Mum won't be pleased and if she helps in the kitchen, Dad won't be pleased. She really is in a no-win situation.</em></li>
</ul>
<table border="0">
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> So a no-win situation is one that is certain to end in failure and disappointment. So Rob I can see you are disappointed because you have spent your winnings on me.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> I am. It seems impossible to win money just for myself.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Actually I also won some money&#151;fifty pounds&#151;so I'll buy you a drink, in fact I'll buy you something to eat too and you don't need to pay me back that five pounds.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Really? Oh Li that's very kind of you. Now I'm in a win-win situation!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Yes, the opposite of a no-win situation is a win-win situation. This is where there is a favourable outcome for everyone involved. Like this:</td></tr>
	<tr><td/><td class="examples">The house buyer got a good price and the seller was happy to sell quickly so it was a win-win situation.</td></tr>
	<tr><td/><td class="examples">If I get to invest your money in the company and you get to share the profits, it's a win-win situation.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> So, in a win-win situation everyone is happy! Just like our situation now. So, where are you taking me for dinner Li?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Did I say dinner? I was just going to buy you a sandwich.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Oh. That's not such a good win-win situation, is it?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Maybe I'll buy you some chips too!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> OK great. Let's go. Bye.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Bye bye.</td></tr>
