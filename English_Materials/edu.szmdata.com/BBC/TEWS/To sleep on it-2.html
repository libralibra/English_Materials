<p>Note: This is not a word-for-word transcript</p>

<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Hello, welcome to The English We Speak, I'm Feifei&#160;...&#160;</p>

<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>&#160;...&#160;and I'm Neil. Hello. We're out shopping today, aren't we, Feifei?</p>

<p><strong>Feifei <br /></strong>Yes, Neil needs to buy a new bed&#151;his old bed has broken. So Neil, look at all these beds&#151;there are so many to choose from but which one do you want to buy?</p>

<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Well, that one there is massive but it wouldn't fit through my front door!</p>

<p><strong>Feifei <br /></strong>Hmm, that one there is quite cheap but&#160;... it doesn't look very well made.</p>

<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Hey look at this one&#160;... a water bed! Listen to the sound it makes!</p>

<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Oh, there are too many beds to choose from!</p>

<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Well, Feifei, I'll have to sleep on it!</p>

<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Neil! You can't sleep on that water bed&#151;you haven't bought it yet&#151;and anyway, you haven't brought your pyjamas!</p>

<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Relax Feifei&#151;I'm not going to sleep here in the shop&#151;that would be embarrassing! When someone says they're going to sleep on it, they mean they're going to spend some time thinking about something before making a final decision.</p>

<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Phew! So you make your final decision later&#151;not now?</p>

<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>That's right! So I'm going to think about which is the best bed to buy and come back in the morning, OK? Let's hear some other examples of the phrase 'to sleep on it'&#160;...&#160;</p>

<p><strong>Examples<br /></strong>We couldn't decide which car to buy so we decided to sleep on it&#151;we didn't want to buy the wrong one!</p>
<p>Thanks for your job offer but I need some time to think about it. Let me sleep on it and I'll give you an answer tomorrow.</p>
<p>He told me he'd have to sleep on it before he could agree to my request for a pay rise.</p>

<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>To sleep on it&#160;... hmm&#160;... but why 'sleep' Neil?</p>

<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Because usually you think about your decision overnight&#151;you literally go to sleep before waking up the next day and deciding what to do, when you've had more rest.</p>

<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>It sounds like a good idea but hold on Neil&#160;...&#160;</p>

<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>What's wrong?</p>

<p><strong>Feifei</strong>
<br /> You can't 'sleep on it' overnight because you haven't got a bed to sleep on!</p>

<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Well, let's not <em>lose sleep over it</em>&#151;you've got a spare bed haven't you?</p>

<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>What?!</p>

<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>It's another idiom Feifei but I'll explain it another time. Come on let's go.</p>

<p><strong>Both<br /></strong>Bye.</p>
