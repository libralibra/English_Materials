	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Hi there I'm Li. Today's word is 'cheesy' and look here Neil, I've got something cheesy for you!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Neil:</td><td> Oh cheese crackers! Yummy&#160;... don't you like them?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> No I find them too cheesy. As I don't eat cheese, I find the flavour a bit too strong.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Neil:</td><td> I like cheese and I love all cheesy food. (Short pause) but I don't like this music you're playing&#160;... it's too cheesy.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Too cheesy? Do you mean the music is no good? It's Christmas&#160;...&#160;</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Neil:</td><td> Well it's all right for this time of the year and it goes with the festive mood. But generally speaking it's too predicable, cheap and cheerful. Let's listen to a couple of examples:
	<tr><td/><td class="examples">A: Would you like to go to the pantomime next week, thought it'd be fun.
<br />B: Em&#160;... I know children love it but I find it a bit too cheesy. I used to love it as a kid.</td></tr>

<br /><em>
<br />A: Hi everyone I am organising our Christmas dinner. How about going back to The Cheshire Cheese pub?
<br />B: The food was excellent, but you know what? The music there was a bit too cheesy,
<br />A: Cheesy? Of course. Maybe that's why the pub is called ' The Cheshire Cheese'.</em></td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> The second speaker there came across as a bit snobbish, don't you think?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Neil:</td><td> Yes the word does have a slightly negative connotation, something too superficial and simple and&#160;...&#160;</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Not deep and sophisticated?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Neil:</td><td> No.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> I see. Remember what you said about the music Iâ€™m playing? So you mean my taste in music is not very sophisticated?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Neil:</td><td> No, don't get me wrong. It's only that one particular piece because I've heard it so many times. Well I must say that your taste in clothes is fabulous. (Pause to get a closer look) Is this a new coat? Never seen it before?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Yes?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Neil:</td><td> I think the bright colours suit you really well, your face is lit up and you look very&#160;... attractive&#160;... and&#160;... charming&#160;... and&#160;...&#160;</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Oh, stop it Neil. I never knew you can be so cheesy! Come on, please have some cheese crackers and that'll stop your cheesy compliments&#160;...&#160;</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Neil:</td><td> Li, you're blushing!</td></tr>
