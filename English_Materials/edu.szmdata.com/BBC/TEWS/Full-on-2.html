<p>Note: This is not a word-for-word transcript</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Hello and welcome to The English We Speak. I'm Feifei and joining me is Harry.</p>


<p><strong>Harry<br /></strong>Hello! And the expression we are going to look at today which we hear a lot in colloquial speech is 'full-on'. So, Feifei&#151;did you have a good weekend?</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>It was quiet. I stayed home most of the time. I watched a couple of old, black and white films with my grandmother on Sunday. That was the highlight. How about you?</p>


<p><strong>Harry<br /></strong>Well, your weekend sounds quite&#160;... relaxed. Well, my weekend wasn't like your weekend at all. I went to the launch party of a new bar on Friday&#151;that was quite a night! Then on Saturday my friends took me to a night club that went on until morning!</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Wow! That sounds exciting. Clubbing though&#151;aren't you a bit old for that sort of thing?</p>


<p><strong>Harry<br /></strong>No, I'm not too old, but to be honest&#151;it was a bit full-on.</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Full-on? What do you mean?</p>


<p><strong>Harry<br /></strong>Well, the music, the dancing, the drinking, the energy. It was very intense. I'm not old, but I'm not as young as I was.</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Right. So full-on means it was very intense.</p>


<p><strong>Harry<br /></strong>Yeah. I think I'll need a few days to recover; it was so full-on.</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>What else can be full-on?</p>


<p><strong>Harry<br /></strong>Some people are a bit full-on. A bit extreme. Not relaxing.</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>I know what you mean. Sarah's a bit full-on isn't she?</p>


<p><strong>Harry<br /></strong>Yes, she scares me. She stands so close when she talks to me and stares straight into my eyes. Work can also be full-on when it's busy.</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Work has been a bit full on lately hasn't it. We've had to do loads of overtime to get the new project finished.</p>


<p><strong>Harry<br /></strong>It has been full-on, yes. Let's listen to some more examples.</p>


<p><strong>Examples<br /><em>Man
<br /></em></strong><em>Have a good holiday?</em></p>


<p><strong><em>Woman</em></strong><em>
<br /> To be honest, not really. We were up at 6am every day to get as much sightseeing done as possible and didn't get to bed till midnight. It was so full-on. I feel like I need another holiday.</em><em></em></p>

<p><em>I really don't like children's parties. All those excited, screaming kids. It's too full-on.</em></p>

<p><em>London's too full-on. I need to move to the countryside.</em></p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Well, if you want a more relaxing weekend next time, come and watch some films with me and my grandmother. It's really laid back.</p>


<p><strong>Harry<br /></strong>That sounds a lot less full-on. I'll do that.</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Join us again soon for The English We Speak.</p>


<p><strong>Harry<br /></strong>Bye!</p>
