<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>Helen is finding her mobile phone company a nightmare to deal with. Neil uses an expression to describe her feeling and comes up with a suggestion.</p>


<p><strong>Neil</strong>
<br />Hello and welcome to The English We Speak from BBC Learning English, I'm Neil.</p>


<p><strong>Helen</strong>
<br />And I'm Helen.</p>


<p><strong>Neil</strong>
<br />Helen, you look upset, what's the matter? Have I done something wrong?</p>


<p><strong>Helen</strong>
<br />Oh, it's not you. It's my mobile phone company. I stopped my contract three months ago and they are still taking money out of my bank account. And it's impossible to get through to customer service.</p>


<p><strong>Neil</strong>
<br />Oh, no, I know what you mean. These mobile phone companies are a nightmare to deal with. They are a real pain in the neck.</p>


<p><strong>Helen</strong>
<br />Pain in your neck? Are you OK? You don't look so comfortable sitting in that chair? Is your neck hurting you?</p>


<p><strong>Neil</strong>
<br />I'm alright. My neck is a bit stiff but ok. When people say pain in the neck, it means something or someone is annoying, actually very annoying for a long time. Here are a few more examples:</p>


<p><strong>Examples</strong>
<br />Sam is so disruptive in the class, he's a pain in the neck to deal with.</p>

<p>Completing this tax form is a real pain in the neck, there are so many boxes to fill in.</p>

<p>The telesales people are a real pain in the neck, they keep ringing me.</p>


<p><strong>Helen</strong>
<br />Well, I am really really really annoyed by this mobile phone company. They are a real pain in the neck to deal with.</p>


<p><strong>Neil</strong>
<br />My suggestion is that if they are still taking money out of your account, threaten them with legal action Helen.</p>


<p><strong>Helen</strong>
<br />I will do that. Thanks for the tip.</p>


<p><strong>Neil</strong>
<br />You're welcome.</p>

<p></p>
