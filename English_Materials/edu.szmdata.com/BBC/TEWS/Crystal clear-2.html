	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Hello Li.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> So Rob, thanks for offering to help me build my new wardrobe. It's come in a hundred pieces and I don't know where to begin.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> No problem Li, I'm happy to lend a hand. I'm great at building furniture!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Good because the instructions seem to be so confusing. This bit here&#160;... doesn't fit&#160;... here.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Let's have a look. Give it to me. Let's have a look at these instructions. Yes, simple, it's crystal clear!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Crystal clear? The instructions are crystal clear? Rob, my wardrobe may look fancy but there are no crystals in it.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> I know that. I just mean the instructions are obvious&#151;they are simple and clear to understand. If we say something is crystal clear we simply mean it is absolutely clear. Is that clear?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> It is. You mean it's easy to understand. I suppose, literally it means as clear as a crystal?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Exactly. Let's hear some examples of this idiom in action:</td></tr>
</table>
<ul>
	<li>The man's directions were crystal clear and we arrived at the station early.</li>
	<li>Mum made it crystal clear that we wouldn't be going to the party.</li>
</ul>
<table border="0">
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> So in those examples, crystal clear was used to mean extremely clear or easy to understand. But Rob, what I can't understand is why you find these instructions crystal clear and I can't?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> That's easy&#151;you had them upside down.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Silly me!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> But if you just put that piece of wood in there&#160;... and put a screw in there&#160;... and hook the doors onto there&#160;... your wardrobe will be complete. Is that clear?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Crystal clear!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Good. But as I'm here now, I'll finish it for you. (Noises of Rob building wardrobe) There you go&#160;... what do you think?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> (Tapping the wood) Yes, it seems quite solid&#160;... oh no&#160;...&#160;
<br />
<br />(Wardrobe collapse)</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Oh dear. Now I know what is really crystal clear.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Oh yes, what's that?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> I will never ask for you to help me build a wardrobe again. Is that clear?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Crystal!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Both:</td><td> Bye.</td></tr>
