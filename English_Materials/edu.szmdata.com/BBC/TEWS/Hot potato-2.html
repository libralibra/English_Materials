<h3><strong>Transcript</strong></h3>
<p><span><strong>Neil <br /></strong></span><span>Hello and welcome to The English We Speak. I'm Neil.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Helen<br /></strong></span><span>Hello everyone. I'm Helen.</span></p>

<p><strong><span>Neil
<br /></span></strong><span>Oh what's the matter, Helen? You look really tired.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Helen<br /></strong></span><span>Is it that bad?</span></p>

<p><strong><span>Neil
<br /></span></strong><span>You've got very dark shadows under your eyes.</span></p>

<p><strong><span>Helen
<br /></span></strong><span>Oh dear. Well, I've been pushed into a role and I don't really want it.</span></p>

<p><strong><span>Neil
<br /></span></strong><span>What is it?</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Helen<br /></strong></span><span>To be the treasurer for the school's parents association and you know I am hopeless with numbers.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Neil<br /></strong></span><span>Sounds like it could turn into a hot potato for you.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Helen<br /></strong></span><span>Hot potato? Do you mean a jacket potato? No I am not hungry, I am nervous.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Neil<br /></strong></span><span>I'm not talking about food. I am talking about this job. I can see it's going to be a problem for you.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Helen<br /></strong></span><span>I'm thinking the same.</span></p>

<p><strong><span>Neil
<br /></span></strong><span>You need to think about it very carefully before it becomes a hot potato. When something becomes a &lsquo;hot potato', it becomes a problem and difficult to handle.</span></p>

<p><strong><span>Helen
<br /></span></strong><span>I see. You can't hold a hot potato in your hand. It would burn you.</span></p>

<p><strong><span>Neil
<br /></span></strong><span>Exactly, you've got it. A hot potato is a phrase we use to refer to difficult or tricky situations, or even people. Here are a few examples:</span></p>

<p><strong><span>Examples
<br /></span></strong><span>The shortage of housing supply is fast becoming a hot potato for the council.</span></p>
<p><span>The pay rise issue is a hot potato for management; I don't know how they are going to sort this one out between the staff, the union and the shareholders.</span></p>

<p><strong><span>Neil
<br /></span></strong><span>Helen, my word of advice is&hellip;</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Helen<br /></strong></span><span>Please, I'm listening.</span></p>

<p><strong><span>Neil
<br /></span></strong><span>Just tell the school you can't do it. Drop it before it becomes a real hot potato for you.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Helen<br /></strong></span><span>You are right. That's what I will do. Thanks</span></p>

<p><strong><span>Neil
<br /></span></strong>You're welcome.</p>
