	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Hello and welcome to The English We Speak from BBC Learning English. I'm Yang Li. I am waiting for Jen to arrive in the studio, but she's outside and she's in a really bad mood, so I thought it would be a good opportunity to teach you some weather idioms. What do you think? Jen's looking really angry. Have a listen&#160;...&#160;</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Jen:</td><td> (Screaming and shouting)</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> She has a face like thunder. If you have a face like thunder, it means that you are very angry indeed. And Jen definitely seems angry!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Jen:</td><td> (In the background) It's so unfair. When things go wrong for me, they always go badly wrong. It never rains but it pours!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> There's another weather idiom. Did you hear it? Jen said "it never rains but it pours." That's something that people say when they think they have very big problems. I wonder what Jen's problem is? Oh, here she comes!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Jen:</td><td> Hi Li. Sorry I'm late. I'm so upset. The boss said that I would get a promotion if I finished all of my work by midday. I finished everything by 12 o'clock and now the boss is ignoring my emails about the promotion and won't talk to me.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> I think you're just chasing rainbows, Jen. If you chase rainbows, it means you are trying to do something that will never happen.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Jen:</td><td> So you don't think I'll get a promotion?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> No, I don't think so. I think the boss was probably just trying to get you to finish your work more quickly.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Jen:</td><td> He tricked me! There he is! I'm going to go and talk to him!
<br />
<br /> (Door closes)</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Well, that all sounds like a storm in a teacup to me. If something is described as 'a storm in a teacup', it means that a person is exaggerating their problems and making their problems sound worse than they actually are. Here's Jen coming back in! (To Jen) Well? What did he say?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Jen:</td><td> He said that he was pleased with my work and that we'll talk about the promotion next week. He also said that I can have the rest of the afternoon off!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> You see, Jen? Every cloud has a silver lining! The idiom means that you can always find something positive, even in a bad situation.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Jen:</td><td> You're absolutely right. What do you think I should do with my free afternoon, then?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Well, I'd go and sit in the park, the weather's lovely today! Join us again for another edition of The English We Speak from BBC Learning English.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Both:</td><td> Bye!</td></tr>
