	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> Getting ready for The English We Speak?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> Well, kind of.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> Look at you <em>-</em> are you going somewhere special later?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> Yes, I am. As it happens, I'm going for an audition for a new TV programme.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> What new programme is it?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> It's called <em>The Analysis -</em>it's all about current affairs and, you know, serious news items.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> Really, I would have thought you would be auditioning for a celebrity chat show. You're looking awfully glamorous for a news programme.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> Well, you can't look like the back end of a bus when you go on TV, no matter what kind of TV programme it is.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> What? Back end of a bus? What's 'bus' got to do with TV?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> Oh, you know what I mean. What do you see on the back of a bus?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> Er, a window and&#160;... er, exhaust pipes?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> Not much to see, is there?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> No, who would want to look at the back end of a bus? It's so ugly.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> Exactly. Nobody wants to look at the back end of a bus. If I looked like the back end of the bus, nobody would hire me in TV.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> I get it. The phrase 'look like the back end of a bus' means looking ugly. You want to look your best <em>-</em> that's why you're wearing make-up and that beautiful dress.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td>That's right.</td></tr>

	<li><em>A: (sobbing) I can't believe what a vengeful person Mike is. We broke up last Friday.</em></li>
	<li><em>B: It doesn't surprise me. I've never thought much of him!</em></li>
	<li><em>A: And he wrote to his friends that he dumped me because I look like the back end of a bus.</em></li>
	<li><em>B: Oh, no! What a horrible thing to say! He should look in the mirror himself.</em></li>
</ul>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> So this expression, 'look like the back end of a bus' is not a very pretty thing to say to anyone. It would really offend somebody.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> No, you should definitely not use it to describe what someone looks like. Let's hope this new dress is worth the money I spent on it. See you later.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> Good luck!</td></tr>
