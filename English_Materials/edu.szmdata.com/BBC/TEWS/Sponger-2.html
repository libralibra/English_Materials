<br /><strong>Example</strong>
<br /><em>
<br />A: When I was at university I had no money at all. I had to buy second-hand clothes and I could never afford to go out for a meal even though I had a part-time job.
<br />B: Yeah me too, but there were all these other students with cars and designer labels eating in expensive restaurants all paid for by Daddy.
<br />A: What a bunch of spongers.
<br />B: Yeah.</em>
<br />
<br /><strong>Li:</strong> A sponger is a person who gets money, food and other things from other people without paying. Often it's used very negatively to describe people who live off state benefits.
<table border="0">
	<tr><td class="roles">Neil:</td><td> Just like a sponge.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Yes, a sponge.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Neil:</td><td> A sponge soaks up the water all around it. A sponger soaks up gifts, food and money without working. And it can also be used as a verb&#151;to sponge off someone.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> It's also a verb 'to sponge off someone.' Be careful to use the word 'off' with this verb.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Neil:</td><td> Whether it's a verb or a noun, it's still not a nice thing to say about someone, Li.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Well I'm sorry to be rude, but it's true&#151;you are a sponger.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Neil:</td><td> You're right. I'm a sponger but I'm proud of it. Do you fancy taking me out for dinner? There's a fantastic restaurant I've been meaning to go to. It's very expensive, but you can afford it Li.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> He's trying to sponge a meal off me! What a sponger&#160;...&#160;</td></tr>
