<h3><strong>Summary</strong></h3>

<p>Feifei's cooking a special cake for Helen's birthday but Rob thinks she might have the wrong recipe. What does he mean and how can Feifei turn the cake from a disaster to a success?</p>
<h3><strong>Transcript</strong></h3>

<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Hello and welcome to The English We Speak. I'm Feifei&hellip;</p>

<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>&hellip;and hello, I'm Rob. Err, Feifei what are you doing?</p>

<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>I'm making a cake&#151;a chocolate cake&#151;obviously!</p>

<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Why are you making a chocolate cake?</p>

<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>It's Helen's birthday. What's wrong with that Rob?</p>

<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Well, for a start we are in a radio studio not a kitchen. Also, you've only got five minutes before she arrives&#151;and you're putting salt in the cake mix not sugar.</p>

<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Ooops!</p>

<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>It's a recipe for disaster!</p>

<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>A recipe for disaster? No, look, it's a recipe for a chocolate cake Rob.</p>

<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong><em>That</em> might be&#151;but a recipe for disaster means a combination of things that will, at some point, go wrong and cause harm, damage or in this case, humiliation&#151;in other words it will end in trouble.</p>

<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>So the phrase isn't about cooking? Oh dear Rob, this wasn't the recipe I wanted to follow!</p>

<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>No. Let's hear some examples of this phrase in action&#151;and we can work out how to limit the damage.</p>

<p><strong>Examples<br /></strong>My doctor says drinking too much, not exercising enough, and having a stressful job are a recipe for disaster. He says I might die young!</p>
<p>I'm not looking forward to the party. Having my wife and ex-girlfriend in the same room will be a recipe for disaster!</p>
<p>Watch out on the road tonight&#151;all that rain followed by freezing temperatures is a recipe for disaster.</p>

<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>So put another way, 'a recipe for disaster' is a phrase that means someone's actions will result in things going badly wrong. So what problem is my cake making going to cause, Rob?</p>

<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Well can't you see there's cake mix on the table&#151;the cake won't be ready in time&#151;and it'll taste disgusting with all that salt in it.</p>

<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Oh calm down&#151;do you want to taste the cake mix?</p>

<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Oh go on then&hellip;. Mmmm, actually it's not too bad. And there's not much mess. Perhaps it's not a disaster&#151;but maybe we shouldn't give it to Helen. Shall we keep it for later?</p>

<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Ha ha&#151;it looks like this has been a recipe for success!</p>

<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>For once Feifei, you might be right! Bye!</p>

<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Bye.</p>
