<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Hello, this is The English We Speak with me Feifei&#160;...&#160;</p>

<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>And me Rob. Hello!</p>

<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>So Rob, what's that thing you've got there?</p>

<p><strong>Rob</strong>
<br />Oh this? It's a barrel [tapping on wooden barrel]&#160;...&#160;</p>

<p><strong>Feifei</strong>
<br />A barrel?! I see.</p>

<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>And do you want to know what's inside?</p>

<p><strong>Feifei</strong>
<br />Not really.</p>

<p><strong>Rob</strong>
<br />OK&#151;well, if I just open the lid here you'll be able to hear [Opens lid and sounds of laughing]&#151;funny, isn't it?!</p>

<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>[not impressed] You have 'a barrel of laughs'&#151;hmm, and that is supposed to be funny?</p>

<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>It's supposed to illustrate today's piece of authentic real English. It's hilarious, isn't it? And do you know what&#151;the phrase 'a barrel of laughs' can be used to describe me&#151;someone who is fun and always joking around.</p>

<p><strong>Feifei</strong>
<br />Really? Someone who is funny is 'a barrel of laughs'? But this doesn't describe you Rob&#151;you're not funny.</p>

<p><strong>Rob</strong>
<br />Oh? What?! I think we'd better hear some examples of this phrase in action&#151;and I'll show you how funny I really am&#160;...&#160;<strong>
<br /><br />Examples<br /></strong>I shall miss having John in the office. He was a such a barrel of laughs.</p>
<p>What a barrel of laughs that bus driver was. He made the long journey much more fun with his funny announcements!</p>
<p>Since I split up with my boyfriend, life hasn't been a barrel of laughs.</p>

<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>So if someone is a 'barrel of laughs', they are fun&#151;and an enjoyable person to be around.</p>

<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Yeah, exactly&#151;the phrase can also describe a thing such as TV show. But come on Feifei, you have to agree, this barrel full of laughs is so funny! Listen to this! [Opens lid again: laughter].</p>

<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Hmm, it's a cheap joke but it's not funny. I know what you can do if you want to make me laugh&#160;...&#160;</p>

<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Oh yes&#151;go on, what is it?</p>

<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Why don't you see if you can fit inside the barrel?</p>

<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Oh, right, OK. Well, that sounds like a laugh. OK, then, here goes&#160;...&#160;[Sound of Rob getting in]&#160;...&#160;Alright, I'm in.</p>

<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Wow Rob&#151;you actually fit in the barrel! That's so funny!</p>

<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Hey Feifei what are you doing?</p>

<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Making you into a real life 'barrel of laughs'</p>

<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>That's not funny.</p>

<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>It's hilarious! See you later.</p>
