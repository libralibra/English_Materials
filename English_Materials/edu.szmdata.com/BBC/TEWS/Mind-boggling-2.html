	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> Hello, and welcome to The English We Speak. My name is Feifei.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">William:</td><td> And I'm William.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> William, how much do you know about China?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">William:</td><td> Er&#160;... Not much. Why are you asking?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> Well, I was flicking through the papers and I came across this quiz.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">William:</td><td> Oh no, not quizzes, I'm rubbish at them.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> Oh, well. Let's see. Here is the first one&#151;name the capital city of China.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">William:</td><td> That's easy, Beijing.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> Yes. Which province is famous for its hot and spicy cuisine?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">William:</td><td> Em, I think Sichuan food is quite spicy.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> See, you are doing well! How about this one&#151;roughly how many characters are there in the Chinese language?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">William:</td><td> Oh, loads. 5,000?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> No. Try again.</td></tr>

	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> Well, actually, roughly 42,000.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">William:</td><td> Wow, that's amazing. I didn't know it was that many. How can people possibly learn them all? It's totally mind-boggling!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> What is mind-boggling?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">William:</td><td> Mind-boggling describes something overwhelming and amazing, like really impressive numbers or facts. It's made up of two words: mind and to boggle. Let's hear an example.</td></tr></td></tr>
	<tr>
		<td/>
		<td>
			<table border="0" class="examples">
				<tr><td class="roles">Woman&#160;1:</td><td>I took my son to the Science Museum on Sunday.
<br />Woman 2: Did you go to the space mission area?
<br />Woman 1: Oh yes. There were rockets, space suits, even parts from a satellite&#151;so many mind-boggling things to see.</td></tr>
			</table>
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> I really want to learn more about the universe. Itâ€™s a fascinating subject.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">William:</td><td> Well, astronomy, the study of stars, has lots of mind-boggling theories.</td></tr></td></tr>
	<tr>
		<td/>
		<td>
			<table border="0" class="examples">
				<tr><td class="roles">Man:</td><td>I was at a physics workshop last month in Munich. There were seminars on black holes and antimatter. It was totally mind-boggling stuff; I think I might have understood about five percent of what was discussed.</td></tr>
			</table>
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> Well, I think I now know what mind-boggling means and how to use this phrase. And here is one final mind-boggling question&#151;How many stars are there in the Milky Way?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">William:</td><td> Er, is it 42,000 again?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> No, no! Some people say there are over 200 billion stars in the Milky Way but no one knows for sure.
<br />
<br /> That's all from us on The English We Speak. See you next time.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">William:</td><td> Bye.</td></tr>
