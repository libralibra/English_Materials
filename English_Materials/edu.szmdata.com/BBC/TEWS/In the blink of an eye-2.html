<h3>Transcript</h3>


<p><strong>Helen</strong>
<br />Hello and welcome to The English We Speak. I'm Helen and joining me today is Sian.</p>


<p><strong>Sian</strong>
<br />Hi everyone. It's nice to take things slowly after the weekend.</p>


<p><strong>Helen</strong>
<br />Have you been running around a lot?</p>


<p><strong>Sian</strong>
<br />Well, I did a 10K charity run with my nephew for his school.</p>


<p><strong>Helen</strong>
<br />And how did it go? Were you prepared for it?</p>


<p><strong>Sian</strong>
<br />I have to say the kids did much better than me. I was almost the last one to finish the race.</p>


<p><strong>Helen</strong>
<br />And how long did that take you?</p>


<p><strong>Sian</strong>
<br />Maybe six hours!</p>


<p><strong>Helen</strong>
<br />Em. That is slow. What about the young runners?</p>


<p><strong>Sian</strong>
<br />They were gone in the blink of an eye.</p>


<p><strong>Helen</strong>
<br />Do you mean they were fast?</p>


<p><strong>Sian<br /></strong>That's right. When we say something happens in the blink of an eye, it means 'very fast', 'very quickly'. It's a common expression in English to give a sense of fast speed. Here are a few examples:</p>


<p><strong>Examples</strong>
<br />My new computer can download a large video in the blink of an eye.</p>

<p>We were so tired after the party; everyone was fast asleep in the blink of an eye.</p>

<p>Sarah couldn't believe that the first two years of university went in the blink of an eye.</p>


<p><strong>Helen</strong>
<br />So this expression 'in the blink of an eye' doesn't only refer to running speed, it can also describe when time goes quickly.</p>


<p><strong>Sian</strong>
<br />That's right. It's often used when changes are happening very fast. And it can be shortened to 'in a blink'.</p>


<p><strong>Examples</strong>
<br />A 70-story skyscraper just rose from the ground in a blink.</p>

<p>I couldn't believe the transformation in Sarah; she went from a shy sixteen-year-old with braces to an outspoken youth MP in a blink.</p>


<p><strong>Helen</strong>
<br />Well, in the blink of an eye. We've finished our programme.</p>


<p><strong>Sian</strong>
<br />That went really quickly. Goodbye.</p>


<p><strong>Helen</strong>
<br />Goodbye.</p>
