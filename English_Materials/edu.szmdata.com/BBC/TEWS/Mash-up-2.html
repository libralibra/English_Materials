<h3>Transcript</h3>

<p><strong>Dan</strong>
<br /> Hello and welcome to The English We Speak from BBC Learning English, I'm Dan and with me is Feifei.</p>

<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Hello.What are all these cds and records for Dan?</p>

<p><strong>Dan<br /></strong>I'm trying to make a mash-up. It's going to be so cool.</p>

<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>A mash-up? What's that?</p>

<p><strong>Dan<br /></strong>You know, when you combine two or more existing pieces of media to create something new. You get them all the time on YouTube. My mash-up is going to be a song.</p>

<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Oh I see. I think I saw one or two online. Someone had taken a bunch of old movie trailers and mashed them up to create a new one.</p>

<p><strong>Dan<br /></strong>Yes, that's it. They've become very popular recently. And it doesn't have to be a song or movie, people mash-up everything&hellip;even pictures and books!</p>

<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Let's hear some examples.</p>

<p><strong>Examples</strong></p>

<p><strong>A:</strong>Wow, great new track! Who made it?<strong>
<br /> B:</strong>It's a mash-up that I got online. I didn't know you could mix jazz and rock!</p>
<p>So I've got these two great pieces of film. One's a romance and one's a horror film. I'm going to mash them up to make a romantic horror!</p>

<p><strong>Dan<br /></strong>A mash-up. A new combination of two already made pieces of material.</p>

<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>So what will your mash-up be, then?</p>

<p><strong>Dan<br /></strong>I'm combining punk, reggae and military band music. Tell me what you think. Listen!</p>

<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>It's certainly very&hellip;.interesting. Maybe don't quit your day job just yet?</p>

<p><strong>Both<br /></strong>Bye!</p>


<p><strong>Dan<br /></strong>Oh! Wait! This is the best part!</p>
