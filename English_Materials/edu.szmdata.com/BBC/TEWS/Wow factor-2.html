<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>Harry and Feifei use an expression for when you are surprised and impressed (or not) to talk about rented accommodation in London.</p>
<h3>Transcript</h3>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Hello and welcome to The English We Speak. I'm Feifei and joining me is Harry.</p>


<p><strong>Harry<br /></strong>Hello there! And the expression we are going to look at in this programme is 'wow factor'.</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>We'll look at what it means and when you can use it. So anyway Harry, how's the flat hunting going?</p>


<p><strong>Harry<br /></strong>Oh, don't ask! Not very well, really. I mean, I've seen a few places so far, but they didn't really appeal to me.</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>So none of them were any good?</p>


<p><strong>Harry<br /></strong>They were OK. Adequate I suppose. I could live in some of them if I had to, but none of them had the wow factor. Do you know what I mean?</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Not really. The wow factor? What is that?</p>


<p><strong>Harry<br /></strong>The wow factor? Something that makes you go 'wow' when you walk in. 'Wow' is something we say in English when we're surprised. So, you know, a sun deck, a view of Big Ben, a steam room, a granite cocktail bar, a shared swimming pool&#151;that kind of thing. My friend who teaches English in Indonesia has his own swimming pool and I was hoping &hellip;</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Yes, but this is London. It's quite hard to get any of those things unless you spend a lot of money. What else can have the wow factor?</p>


<p><strong>Harry<br /></strong>You hear it a lot on TV. On cooking shows, when someone creates an exciting tasty dish they say it's really got the wow factor.</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Yes, I heard that. 'It's just an omelette, but the chillies give it a real wow factor'.</p>


<p><strong>Harry<br /></strong>That's right. And in singing competitions, if the singer delivers an exciting performance, the judges say they really had the wow factor.</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>So, you can apply it to anything or anyone that is surprisingly good or impressive?</p>


<p><strong>Harry<br /></strong>That's right. Let's listen to some more examples.</p>


<p><strong>Examples<br /></strong><em>He's just bought a new Italian sports car&#151;it's really got the wow factor.</em></p>

<p><em>We're going to completely re-decorate the restaurant so there's more of a wow factor when you walk in.</em></p>

<p><em>Your CV looks OK. Your work experience is solid, but there's no real wow factor that will impress employers.</em></p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>So, do you think you'll find a place to live with the wow factor?</p>


<p><strong>Harry<br /></strong>I'm not sure. But if I don't, I might spend my money on a 72-inch 3D TV. That way people will still get the wow factor when they walk in.</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>That would certainly have the wow factor, and I want to come round and watch some cookery shows and singing competitions.</p>


<p><strong>Harry<br /></strong>No problem! Join us again soon for The English We Speak.</p>


<p><strong>Both<br /></strong>Bye!</p>
