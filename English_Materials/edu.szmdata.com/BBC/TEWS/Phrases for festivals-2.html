	<tr><td class="roles">Yang&#160;Li:</td><td> Hello, I'm Yang Li and this is The English We Speak.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">William:</td><td> I'm William Kremer. Welcome to the programme.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Yang&#160;Li:</td><td> Ah William, I am so excited!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">William:</td><td> Really? What's brought this on, then?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Yang&#160;Li:</td><td> This weekend something really really really great is happening! Do you know what it is?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">William:</td><td> No&#160;...&#160;</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Yang&#160;Li:</td><td> It has to do with music&#160;...&#160;</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">William:</td><td> Hmm. Is it a big opera?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Yang&#160;Li:</td><td> No, it takes place outdoors&#160;...&#160;</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">William:</td><td> Ah, is it opera in the park?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Yang&#160;Li:</td><td> No, no, it's not opera. It's Glastonbury!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">William:</td><td> Oh wow, the huge music festival! I've never been. What's the line-up this year?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Yang&#160;Li:</td><td> Oh no, you don't need to queue. You can just get tickets online. But of course, they are sold out now.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">William:</td><td> No, no, the line-up, Li. Who's playing?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Yang&#160;Li:</td><td> Oh, I see. There's U2 and the Chemical Brothers and Fleet Foxes and Elbow&#160;... and loads and loads of bands of course. But William, I'm confused about this phrase line-up&#160;...&#160;</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">William:</td><td> Well, in America to 'wait in line' means to queue. But a line-up refers to all the bands that are playing in a festival.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Yang&#160;Li:</td><td> Oh right. So, is this phrase only used for music festivals?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">William:</td><td> No, it isn't. Listen to this:</td></tr><p><em>Man: Is Jones playing this weekend?</em></p><p><em>Man 2: No, he's still injured so he's not in the line-up.</em></p>
<table border="0">
	<tr><td class="roles">William:</td><td> So in that example 'the line-up' meant the members of a sports team playing in a match. The line-up.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Yang&#160;Li:</td><td> Well anyway, it's a pretty good line-up at Glastonbury this weekend. I can't wait.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">William:</td><td> Who's headlining on Sunday?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Yang&#160;Li:</td><td> Eh, what?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">William:</td><td> Headlining. Who's headlining? Ah, I think I know why you're confused. 'To headline' doesn't mean to be in the newspapers. It means to be the main act in a festival. The main act is 'the headline act'.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Yang&#160;Li:</td><td> Oh right. I think Beyoncé Knowles is headlining on Sunday. She is the headline act.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">William:</td><td> Ah yes, Beyoncé. I've heard of her. Is she the one that does that dance, like this&#160;...&#160;</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Yang&#160;Li:</td><td> Oh William, stop it! Stop it! You are not Beyoncé Knowles! It looks wrong!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">William:</td><td> (laughing) OK, OK. So, what time do you leave?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Yang&#160;Li:</td><td> Eh?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">William:</td><td>What time are you going to Glastonbury? It's quite a long way, you know Li. You should probably be getting on a train about now.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Yang&#160;Li:</td><td> Oh no, I'm not going! It costs an absolute fortune, you know, and it can be so muddy! And I don't like the idea of those festival toilets. Oh, no, no, no, it's not for me. I'm just going to watch it on telly.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">William:</td><td> Oh OK, right! Well, for everyone who is going to a music festival this year, we hope you have a fantastic time. I hope that the line-up is great and that the headline act doesn't disappoint. Bye!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Yang&#160;Li:</td><td> Bye.</td></tr>
