<table border="0">
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td>Hello and welcome to the English We Speak. My name is Rob.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> And hello, my name is Helen.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Hold on Helen, hold on. We can't hear you properly. I think your microphone is playing up.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td>Playing up?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Sorry, I didn't quite catch that.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td>Let me just push this button. There! Hello. Now, you said the microphone was playing up?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td>That's right. It wasn't working properly. If something isn't working as it should be, we sometimes say it's playing up.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td>Up&#151;not down?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Nope. Playing down is a different expression that means something totally different.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> OK. So as the picture on my TV at home is flickering, I can say my TV is playing up?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Exactly. Let's hear about some other things that are playing up&#160;...&#160;</td></tr>
	<tr><td/><td class="examples">I don't think I'll be able to give you a lift to work today, my car's been playing up.</td></tr>
	<tr><td/><td class="examples">My phone keeps playing up. Every time I dial a number, it just switches itself off.</td></tr><p>
<br /><strong>Helen:</strong> That sounds like my phone! So if something isn't doing what is should do then it's misbehaving?
<table border="0">
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Ha Ha! Well, you could say that. It's just like people. When they misbehave we can say they're playing up. Like this&#160;...&#160;</td></tr>
	<tr><td/><td class="examples">Sorry but I'm going to be late. The children have been playing up and I've still got so much to do.</td></tr><p>
<br /><strong>Helen:</strong> Children are very good at playing up; it's usually because they want attention.
<table border="0">
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Now, Helen, could I have your attention now please because playing up is also something you can say to describe a part of your body that's not working properly.</td></tr>
	<tr><td/><td class="examples">Ow! I'm going to have to lie down; my back's playing up again.</td></tr>
	<tr><td/><td class="examples">Count me out of this weekend's football match; my leg's playing up so I need to rest it.</td></tr>

<p><strong>
<br />Helen:</strong>So it seems playing up refers to anything that's not working or behaving as it should. Now Rob, my leg's also been playing up so I wonder if you could give me a lift home in your car?
<table border="0">
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td>No way&#151;oh it looks like my microphone's playing up now!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> No Rob, it's you who's playing up&#151;now switch it back on!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Oh, oh OK then Helen!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> Let's go then. Bye!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Bye.</td></tr>
