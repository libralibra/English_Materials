<table border="0">
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Hello and welcome to The English We Speak. I'm Yang Li.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">William:</td><td> (subdued) I'm William Kremer.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> So, what English are we speaking today, William?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">William:</td><td> (sigh) I don't know.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Oh what a big sigh! What's wrong?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">William:</td><td> Oh, it doesn't matter.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Oh, come on! I can see something's not right. What's wrong?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">William:</td><td> (sigh) It's&#160;... well, if you must know, it's Tigger&#160;... he's died.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Tigger? Who's Tigger?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">William:</td><td> Tigger&#160;... Tigger is&#160;... Tigger was my beautiful cat. He was my best friend. I suppose you could say that. I'm going to miss his stripey face in the morning. And his purr, yeah, I'm going to miss that. But, you know, these things happen. I shouldn't get so upset&#160;...&#160;</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Why not? I think it's normal to be very sad when a pet dies.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">William:</td><td> No, no, it's silly! I'm getting upset over an animal! I'm not a baby! I should grow up.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> But you might find it helpful to talk about your feelings for Tigger.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">William:</td><td> No, no, no, no! I hate all of that touchy-feely stuff!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Touchy-feely?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">William:</td><td> Yeah, if something is touchy-feely it's very emotional. If you are a touchy-feely person you don't mind talking about your feelings and maybe actually hugging people.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> I see. So is this a negative phrase, touchy-feely?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">William:</td><td> Yeah, a little bit. Let's hear a couple of examples of it in use:</td></tr>
</table>
<ul>
	<li><em>Man: Do you know, I never once saw my mum and dad kiss or hug.</em></li>
	<li><em>Man 2: Really? Gosh, that seems incredible.</em></li>
	<li><em>Man: But I think they really loved each other. They just weren't all touchy-feely about it.</em></li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><em>Woman: Did you go to that drama group?</em></li>
	<li><em>Woman 2: Yeah. I don't think I'll go again.</em></li>
	<li><em>Woman: Oh? Why not?</em></li>
	<li><em>Woman 2: Well, the acting was fine. But it's all that touchy-feely stuff they do that I don't like.</em></li>
</ul>
<table border="0">
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Look, you English people! You just can't talk about your feelings, can you?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">William:</td><td> Well, you might be right Li&#151;we're not famous for talking about our feelings. Now, before we finish, I have heard this phrase touchy-feely being used in a very different way too. Listen to this:</td></tr>
</table>
<ul>
	<li><em>Woman: I love your sweater!</em></li>
	<li><em>Man: Thanks.</em></li>
	<li><em>Woman: It's so soft! I love this material. It's so touchy-feely!</em></li>
	<li><em>Man: OK. Shall I take it off and then you can touch it properly?!</em></li>
</ul>
<table border="0">
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> So in that example, 'touchy-feely' was being used to describe a kind of material.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">William:</td><td> Yes. If something is touchy-feely it is very soft. You want to stroke it, just like Tigger. I'm going to miss stroking Tigger.</p><p></td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">William:</td><td> The way he used to purr&#160;... And sometimes he would bring me a little present, you know. A dead mouse or maybe a little bird. So thoughtful.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Hmm. It's OK to cry you know, William&#160;...&#160;</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">William:</td><td> (recovering himself) No! No it's not. No touchy-feely stuff!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Oh I give up. Goodbye everyone.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">William:</td><td> Bye!</td></tr>
