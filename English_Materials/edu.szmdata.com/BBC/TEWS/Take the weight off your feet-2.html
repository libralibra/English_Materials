	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Hello, it’s Rob here.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> And me, Helen. This is The English We Speak. Rob I don’t know why we have to stand up when we present this programme&#151;it’s quite tiring.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Really? I thought standing up would give us more energy and sitting down makes us a bit lazy.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> But I’ve been standing up all day, this is my only chance to sit down.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Why didn’t you say. Here, have a chair, take the weight off your feet.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> The weight?! Take the weight off my feet&#151;that’s a bit rude! Do you mean I’m heavy and my feet can’t carry the weight?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Helen don’t be so sensitive. I was being kind. It’s a way of saying, relax, sit down, especially after standing up for a long time. It's got nothing to do with your actual weight.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> Oh I see. I that case, I will.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Here are some other ways of saying that phrase&#160;...&#160;</td></tr>

	<tr><td/><td class="examples">Don’t walk to work today, go on the bus and take the weight off your feet.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Those are different situations where you can take the weight off your feet.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> I have to admit Rob, it’s very comfortable sitting down. I feel quite relaxed I think I’ll put my feet up too.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> That’s another expression we use&#151;to put our feet up. Again it means rest and relax and literally, put your feet up on the sofa, or in your case, on the desk. Helen you could have taken your shoes off!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> Sorry. So to put your feet up is all about relaxing and resting our feet. Ahh, lovely! Can we hear some more examples please?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Yes Helen!</td></tr>
	<tr><td/><td class="examples">You’ve been gardening all day, come inside and put your feet up.</td></tr>
	<tr><td/><td class="examples">After working for the company for 30 years, Jim has decided it’s time to finally put his feet up and retire.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> If he’s retiring he’ll be putting his feet up for a long time. But Helen we’ve got work to do, so back on your feet.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> You want me to put the weight on my feet now?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> I’m afraid so. It’s time to go shopping.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> Shopping! Why didn’t you say. Look, I’m back on my feet now.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> That was quick. OK, best foot forward, off to the supermarket we go&#151;left, right, left, right&#160;...&#160;</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> Shopping at the supermarket!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Yes, the supermarket Helen. Bye!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> Bye.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Come on&#151;left, right, left right, keep moving those feet.</td></tr>
