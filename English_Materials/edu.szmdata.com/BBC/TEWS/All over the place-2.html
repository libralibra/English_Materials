<p><span><span>Note: this is not a word-for-word transcript</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong>Neil<br /></strong></span><span>Hello, and welcome to The English We Speak. I'm Neil and&hellip; er&hellip; here with me&hellip;</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Feifei<br /></strong></span><span>Here with you is&hellip; Feifei. What are you looking for, Neil?</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Neil<br /></strong></span><span>I'm looking for my script&#160;...&#160;</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Feifei<br /></strong></span><span>Your script?</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Neil<br /></strong></span><span>Yeah&hellip; and&hellip; my pen&hellip; I had it a moment ago&hellip; where's it gone?</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Feifei<br /></strong></span><span>What's going on with you, Neil? You're all over the place today!</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Neil<br /></strong></span><span>Yes, I am! That's a good expression: all over the place!</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Feifei<br /></strong></span><span>It can mean that someone is disorganised and confused&#151;they are all over the place.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Neil<br /></strong></span><span>Yes, and it can also mean that things are left in many places in an untidy way&#151;your things are all over the place! Here are some examples of how this expression is used:</span></p>

<p><strong><span data-mce-mark="1">Examples
<br /></span></strong><span data-mce-mark="1">Don't expect Simon to help you with your report. He's all over the place right now&#151;he can't even finish his own work.</span></p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">What a windy day. My hair's all over the place!</span></p>

<p><strong><span>Neil</span></strong>
<br /><span>Well Feifei, I'm afraid I'm a bit disorganised today. You know I woke up late, I missed my bus and&hellip; well the day'</span><span>s just been a bit difficult. I <em>am</em> all over the place&hellip; and&hellip; where is it&hellip;?</span></p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1"><strong>Feifei</strong>
<br /></span><span data-mce-mark="1">What are you looking for now?</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Neil<br /></strong></span><span>I still haven't found my script.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Feifei<br /></strong></span><span>Is it this one?</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Neil<br /></strong></span><span>Yes, that's it! Great!</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Feifei<br /></strong></span><span>And here's your pen. It was on the floor.</span></p>

<p><strong><span>Neil
<br /></span></strong><span>Good. I'm ready to start the programme now.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Feifei<br /></strong></span><span>The programme's finished, Neil. It's done.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Neil<br /></strong></span><span>Oh, is it? So&hellip; we can go now? I could do with a coffee, Feifei.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Feifei<br /></strong></span><span>Yes&#151;it will do you good. Let's go.</span></p>

<p><strong><span>Both
<br /></span></strong><span>Bye!</span></p>
