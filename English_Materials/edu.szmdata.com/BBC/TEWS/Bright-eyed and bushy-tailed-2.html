<table border="0">
	<tr><td class="roles">Will:</td><td> Hi! I'm William. And here's&#160;... er well, something that looks a bit like Li, but kind of half-Li half-animal. Are you okay Li?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Yes, I am very well, thank you.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Will:</td><td> I don't mean to be rude, but&#160;... why have you got a large, bushy tail today?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Well, it was an order from the boss.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Will:</td><td> The boss told you to come in with a tail?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Yes.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Will:</td><td> Right. But what about the bright, sparkling glitter around your eyes?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Oh, that too. Don't you think it makes my eyes look lovely and bright?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Will:</td><td> Well, yes, they are kind of&#160;... dazzling.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> I think he will be pleased. Yesterday he wasn't pleased with me. He said I looked bored and tired. It's true I didn't get much work done, I'd had a late night.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Will:</td><td> Right. So what will the tail and sparkly eyes do&#151;make you work harder?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Yes! Apparently!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Will:</td><td> Li, I'm not sure that the rest of the team will be able to concentrate with all of that fur and glitter in the office!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Well, it was the boss's idea&#151;not mine.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Will:</td><td> Li, what did he actually say when he asked you to do this?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> He said: 'Li, tomorrow I expect you to come in bright-eyed and bushy-tailed.'</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Will:</td><td> Right. I hate to say this, but it's just an expression.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> What? Just an expression? Why does this keep happening to me?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Will:</td><td> Well, if you're bright-eyed and bushy-tailed, you're full of energy and enthusiasm. The boss didn't expect you to come in looking like some kind of squirrel on its way to the Oscars.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Oh.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Will:</td><td> He just wanted you to be a bit more motivated and energetic.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Oh no, I'm never going to be able to get this tail off&#151;I put so much glue on it. Everyone will laugh at me!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Will:</td><td> Maybe. Here are some examples:</td></tr>
</table>
<ul>
	<li><em>Wow, look at you, all bright-eyed and bushy-tailed! It looks like you're ready for action!</em></li>
	<li><em>After the summer holidays, the children returned to school bright-eyed and bushy-tailed.</em></li>
</ul>
<table border="0">
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Oh Will, what will people say when they look at my tail?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Will:</td><td> They'll probably just start feeding you nuts.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Oh! This is terrible!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Will:</td><td> Or maybe acorns.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> What shall I do?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Will:</td><td> Well I wouldn't eat the acorns, but there's nothing wrong with nuts.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Will, help me! Pull this tail, please, pull!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Will:</td><td> Okay. Come on! Come on, silly tail!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> It's all the boss's fault!</td></tr>
