<table border="0">
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Hi Neil. How are you today?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Neil:</td><td> Hello Li. I'm a bit worried. All these bills to pay&#160;... there'll be no money left for my holiday.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> My problems are over and so are yours, Neil! I'll pay all my bills, and yours, and&#160;... where do you want to go for a holiday? How about Dubai? Five star hotel, by the beach, drinking champagne&#160;...&#160;</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Neil:</td><td>Well, it's very generous of you, Li, but where are you going to get the money for that?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> I won the lottery!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Neil:</td><td> The lottery?! That's brilliant! How much?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Yes. I won US$10m! It's a lot of money, Neil! They sent me an email this morning.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Neil:</td><td> An email?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td>Yes. The only thing that the organisers are asking is for me to pay them a small fee and give them the details of my bank account so that they can transfer the money. I'm a millionaire!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Neil:</td><td>Mmmm&#160;... I smell a rat!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> A rat?! Where?! I am terrified of rats! Where is it? I can't see a rat!</td></tr>
	<tr><td>&#160;</td><td class="stageDescriptions">(Li stands on her chair)</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Neil:</td><td> No, no, no! No need to stand on the chair, Li. There's no rat, no mouse, there're no rodents at all here. In English, when we say we 'smell a rat' we mean we're suspicious of someone: we feel there's something wrong.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> So you think there is something wrong with this lottery?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Neil:</td><td> Yes, I'm afraid so. Let's hear some examples of how to use 'smell a rat', today's expression in The English We Speak.<em>
<br />
<br />A: I read an article about a diet which makes you lose six kilos in one week. It says there is no need for exercise</em>
<br /><em>B: Six kilos in one week?! That's impossible! I smell a rat!</em><em>
<br />
<br />Jane smelt a rat when she read a job advert for actresses in the newspaper. It said "no training or experience required", but they wanted someone "good-looking and open-minded".</em>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Oh. No money for me then&#160;... but are you sure, Neil? Maybe this one is for real&#160;...&#160;?</td></tr></td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Neil:</td><td> No, it's not, Li. And you shouldn't send emails around with your bank details. It's very dangerous. Someone might steal your money!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Yes. I should be careful with my email.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Neil:</td><td> Think: have you ever entered the Australian lottery? Did you buy a ticket?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td>No. I've never even been to Australia.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Neil:</td><td> So how could you be the winner? It's a scam, Li. It's a dishonest way to make money by deceiving people like you.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> You are right, Neil. I wanted to win the lottery so much!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Neil:</td><td> So let's go out and buy a proper lottery ticket. One we know is real!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Maybe we will win.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Neil:</td><td>Maybe we will! Let's go. Bye.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Bye.</td></tr>
