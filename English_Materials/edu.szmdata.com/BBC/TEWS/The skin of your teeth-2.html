	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Hi, I'm Li, and welcome to The English We Speak. I'm here today with Jen.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Jennifer:</td><td> <out of breath> Hi!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> You look a little&#160;... flustered? Are you ok?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Jennifer:</td><td> I woke up late and had to run to the train station. There's only one train an hour. I ran all the way there and made it by the skin of my teeth, just as the doors were closing. Phew! Is there any coffee&#160;...&#160;?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Hang on&#160;... how did your teeth help you to run for the train?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Jennifer:</td><td> Sorry?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> You said "I made it by the skin of my teeth." I've got to see this! Show me your teeth! When did they grow skin?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Jennifer:</td><td> There's no skin on my teeth. That would be disgusting. Yuck.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> So what did you mean?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Jennifer:</td><td> If you do something 'by the skin of your teeth' it means that you did it by a narrow margin&#151;so you just managed to do it, or almost failed.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> So, if you got to the train by the skin of your teeth, it means that you nearly missed it?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Jennifer:</td><td> That's exactly right. Let's hear some more examples of the phrase in action:</td></tr>
</table>
<ul>
	<li><em>My brother's so lucky&#151;he never does any revision for exams but always manages to pass by the skin of his teeth!
<br />
<br /></em></li>
	<li><em>Hi, I'm stuck in a traffic jam&#151;I might still make it to the presentation, but it'll be by the</em><em> skin of my teeth.</em></li>
</ul>
<table border="0">
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> So when you just manage to do something, you can say you did it by the skin of your teeth?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Jennifer:</td><td> That's it.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> That's a really funny phrase. I like it.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Jennifer:</td><td> It's good to be able to get your teeth into English phrases like this.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> My teeth? What about my teeth?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Jennifer:</td><td> It's just another phrase, silly. If you get your teeth into something, it means that you become really involved in it.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Well in that case, I do love getting my teeth into a new phrase&#160;... Teeth&#160;... hang on&#160;... Oh no! I've just remembered, I have a dentist's appointment at twelve o'clock&#151;it's ten to twelve now, I'll never make it!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Jennifer:</td><td> You go, I'll finish the programme&#151;if you run you might make it, but by the skin of your teeth!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Thanks Jen&#151;bye&#160;...&#160;<runs out of door></td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Jennifer:</td><td> Join us again for another edition of The English We Speak and visit our website, bbclearningenglish.com. Bye!</td></tr>
