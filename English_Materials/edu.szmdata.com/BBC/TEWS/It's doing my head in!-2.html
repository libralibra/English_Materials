	<tr><td class="roles">Jennifer:</td><td> Hello and welcome to The English We Speak from BBC Learning English. My name is Jennifer and Li is with me here in the studio.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Hello everyone. What have you been doing this morning, Jen?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Jennifer:</td><td> Oh I've been playing on this great new game on my smartphone. It's a puzzle where you have to find matching pictures of fruit. Now it sounds easy, but it's really addictive.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> I love puzzles like this, especially when they're really addictive. Can I have a go?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Jennifer:</td><td> Yes, you can. In fact, I'm stuck on level 33. I can't complete it at all. Why don't you see if you can do it for me? It's doing my head in!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> OK, give it to me and I'll see what I can do. Jen said that the computer game is 'doing her head in'. If something is 'doing your head in', it means it is frustrating or annoying.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Jennifer:</td><td> It's a phrase which is often used by young people, it's a slang phrase. Let's hear some examples of how you might use it: <em>
<br /></em></td></tr>

<ul>
	<li><em>(shouting) Can you please turn that music down? It's so loud and it's really doing my head in!</em></li>
	<li><em>I've done all my maths homework, except question two. I can't work out the answer and it's really doing my head in.</em></li>
	<li><em>I hate it when people drop litter in the street&#151;it does my head in to see so much rubbish everywhere.</em></li>
</ul>
<table border="0">
	<tr><td class="roles">Jennifer:</td><td> So the computer game is doing my head in because I find it difficult. It's frustrating.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> You can also say that people are doing your head in, if they annoy you in some way.</td></tr>
	<tr><td/><td class="examples">I don't want to invite Sonia to the Christmas party. She gossips all the time. She really does my head in.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Jennifer:</td><td> So 'doing your head in' is a really useful phrase to know, wouldn't you agree, Li?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td><em>(ignoring Jen but playing computer game)</em> Yes! Yes!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Jennifer:</td><td> Li, I said: 'doing your head in is a really useful phrase'.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td><em> (still playing the game)</em> Hang on&#160;... If I can just match these pictures&#160;... Yes! Level 34!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Jennifer:</td><td> Li, it's been five hours. I need my phone back now.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> But I'm on to level 79&#151;just let me get to level 80 and I'll give it back to you.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Jennifer:</td><td> Oh Li, you're really doing MY head in. Join us again for another edition of The English We Speak from BBC Learning English. Bye!</td></tr>
