<table border="0">
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Hi Finn. I'm so happy. I'm going to buy a brand new computer this afternoon and it's very, very cheap.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Finn:</td><td> What a bargain, Li! Where are you going to buy it? Can I go with you?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> I'm going to meet a friend of my neighbour's cousin. He's selling it.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Finn:</td><td> Do you know this man, Li?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> No, but he sounded very nice on the phone. He's nice but a bit clumsy.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Finn:</td><td> Alright. Why?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> He told me the computer fell off the back of his lorry but it works perfectly.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Finn:</td><td> It fell off the back of a lorry?!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Yes. But it came in a very strong box and he said it was in perfect condition.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Finn:</td><td> Li, the computer didn't actually fall off anywhere. It was taken.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> What do you mean?!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Finn:</td><td> In English, when you say something 'fell off the back of a lorry', or if you say something is 'off the back of a lorry', what you mean is that it was received in suspicious circumstances. It was probably stolen.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Stolen?!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Finn:</td><td> Yes. In the US and Australia they say 'fell off the back of a truck', but it means the same thing. It's a humorous way of describing stolen property.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Oh. It's a crime! There's nothing humorous about that.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Finn:</td><td> 'Off the back of a lorry' is today's expression in The English We Speak. Let's hear some examples of how it's used.</td></tr>
</table>
<ul>
	<li>The police have been looking for a local man who doesnâ€™t mind selling mobile phones that fell off the back of a lorry.</li>
	<li>The black market was thriving when the war ended. It wasn't difficult to find all sorts of things off the back of a lorry.</li>
</ul>
<table border="0">
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Thank you, Finn, for the warning. I'm not going to buy that cheap computer now.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Finn:</td><td> Well. I'm sorry to have disappointed you. Li, but it's always good to know these unusual expressions in English!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Well, there goes my bargain. Back to saving money to buy a computer in a real shop.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Finn:</td><td> Good idea. What is cheap might end up costing much more than you expect.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Indeed. I won't buy stuff off the back of a lorry. Better safe than sorry. Bye.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Finn:</td><td> Bye.</td></tr>
