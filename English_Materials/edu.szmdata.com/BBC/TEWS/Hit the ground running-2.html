	<tr><td class="roles">Yang&#160;Li:</td><td> I'm Yang Li. Hey Kaz, you're out of breath and wearing running shoes, what's going on?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Kaz:</td><td> Wait a minute Li (gulp for breath), let me catch my breath. Yes, I'm wearing my running shoes because I've been running.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Yang&#160;Li:</td><td> You've been running&#151;why? Were you late?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Kaz:</td><td> No it was because of something my boss told me to do.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Yang&#160;Li:</td><td> Your boss told you to run to the studio&#151;hmm strange.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Kaz:</td><td> No no, she said "Kaz, when you start tomorrow's programme, I want you to hit the ground running".</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Yang&#160;Li:</td><td> "I want you to hit the ground running"&#151;sounds rather dangerous.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Kaz:</td><td> Well, I thought I'd do it literally&#151;you know, just for fun.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Yang&#160;Li:</td><td> Oh I see. You thought you'd literally hit the ground running&#151;so you leapt off a fast moving bus and ended up running all the way to the studio!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Kaz:</td><td> That's right, that's why I'm out of breath. I literally hit the ground running!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Yang&#160;Li:</td><td> But I get the feeling your boss didn't want you to literally "hit the ground running".</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Kaz:</td><td> You're absolutely right Li. When she said, "Kaz, when you start tomorrow's programme, I want you to hit the ground running" she meant "When you start tomorrow's programme, I want you to immediately work very hard on it to make it successful".</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Yang&#160;Li:</td><td> OK. Kaz's boss wanted him to get today's programme off to a brisk and successful start. She wanted him 'to hit the ground running'. I think Kaz, you did exactly that. Let's listen to some more examples:</td></tr>
</table>
<ul>
	<li><em>If you want to succeed in your new job, you'll need to hit the ground running<strong>,</strong></em><em>from day one.</em></li>
	<li><em>You guys will have to hit the ground running on this new project.</em></li>
	<li><em>The President promised that if he was re-elected he would hit the ground running on the question of unemployment.</em></li>
</ul>
<table border="0">
	<tr><td class="roles">Yang&#160;Li:</td><td> Kaz, the expression 'to hit the ground running' sounds American&#151;is that right?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Kaz:</td><td> Yeah, I think you're right Yang Li but we're beginning to hear it more often in British English</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Yang&#160;Li:</td><td> It's an American import then?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Kaz:</td><td> Yes, I think it is. You tend to hear it in connection with speed and efficiency especially on new projects.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Yang&#160;Li:</td><td> Great!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Kaz:</td><td> But one thing's for certain Li.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Yang&#160;Li:</td><td> What's that?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Kaz:</td><td> On this programme we always hit the ground running!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Yang&#160;Li:</td><td> You're right there Kaz. On this programme we always hit the ground running! We always give it 110%! Bye!</td></tr>
