	<tr><td class="roles">Finn:</td><td>Yes. What better than enjoying a little bubbly&#151;a little champagne&#151;here under the tropical sun?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td>But Finn&#160;... last week you told me you had no money&#151;you said you were skint. This is a pretty expensive holiday!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Finn:</td><td> Yeah. That's true. But you know what? Our boss called me into his room and said I was up for a promotion! So I thought&#151;you only live once and you've got to splash out! Actually, I do fancy a swim. Here we go!</td></tr>

	<tr><td class="roles">Finn:</td><td> Hi, Li. It's lovely here in the water!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Good, good! But his phrase 'to splash out' has nothing to do with diving. It means to spend a lot of money on pleasant things you don't really need&#151;and it's our phrase in The English We Speak today. Let's hear some examples:</td></tr>

	<tr><td class="roles">Finn:</td><td>Ah, what a swim! It's great being here on holiday, isn't it Li?</td></tr>
