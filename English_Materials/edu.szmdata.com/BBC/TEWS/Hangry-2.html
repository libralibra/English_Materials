<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>When Feifei arrives at the studio, she realises that Sian is not in a very good mood! What is wrong with her? Maybe she just needs something to eat&#151;quickly! There is a word to describe this combination of anger and hunger. Find out what it is in the programme.</p>
<h3>Transcript</h3>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Hello and welcome to The English We Speak. I'm Feifei and joining me is Sian.</p>


<p><strong>Sian <br /></strong>Hi everyone.</p>


<p><strong>Feifei</strong>
<br /> Are you OK Sian?</p>


<p><strong>Sian<br /></strong>Yes, of course I am! Can we just get on with the programme?!</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Um Sian, have you had your breakfast today?</p>


<p><strong>Sian<br /></strong>No I haven't. I overslept and then the bus was late and, uh, it's just not been a good day so far!</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Hmmm, maybe we should do the programme once you've eaten something. Here have this chocolate bar.</p>


<p><strong>Sian<br /></strong>Oh I'm sorry, I know I'm a bit hangry this morning. I do tend to get moody when I don't eat. My husband's always complaining about it!</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Hangry? Don't you mean 'angry'?</p>


<p><strong>Sian<br /></strong>No, 'hangry'. 'Hangry' describes someone who is angry&#151;or irritable&#151;as a result of being hungry. Like me today&#151;I'm feeling a bit annoyed because I haven't eaten breakfast!</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>You certainly are! So 'hangry' is a combination of 'angry' and 'hungry'?</p>


<p><strong>Sian<br /></strong>Yes, that's right. Let's hear a few examples.</p>


<p><strong>Examples<br /></strong>A: This food is taking forever to arrive. I'm not coming to this restaurant again.
<br />B: Oh dear, someone's getting hangry! Let's get you some food quickly!</p>

<p>My boyfriend is a nightmare whenever he misses a meal; he gets so hangry!</p>

<p>People tend to get a bit hangry when their blood sugar level drops.</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Interesting. You wouldn't catch me getting 'hangry' though, I'm always very chilled.</p>


<p><strong>Sian<br /></strong>Is that right Feifei? You know, I'm feeling much happier after eating that chocolate bar. Shall we do the programme again? I feel ready now.</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>No! come on that will do. I'm starving!</p>


<p><strong>Sian<br /></strong>Oh dear, it seems like you're a bit hangry too Feifei! Let's get you to the cafe now.</p>


<p><strong>Feifei</strong>
<br /> Good idea! Let's go.</p>
