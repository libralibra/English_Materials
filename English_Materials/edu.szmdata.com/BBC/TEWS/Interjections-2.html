	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> Interjections?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Finn:</td><td>Yes. These are mostly sounds we make to express sudden emotions such as surprise, delight, displeasure, disappointment, pain, things like that. We use them more when we speak than when we write.</td></tr>

	<tr><td class="roles">Finn:</td><td> Wow!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> Yes. I know you're pleasantly surprised. It's by a very famous designer. It was the last one in the shop and cost a lot of money. There was this woman in the shop who wanted the dress too. She tried to snatch it from me and she pinched my arm like this&#160;... I'll do it to you&#160;...&#160;</td></tr>

	<tr><td class="roles">Finn:</td><td>Ugh!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td>It's not a pretty sight, is it? It's unpleasant to look at. And&#160;... well, I think you won the bet, Finn.</td></tr>

	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td>You're obviously delighted&#151;happy with the outcome of our bet. You can speak normally now. I know you're bursting to use proper words!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Finn:</td><td> Phew!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td>An expression of relief. Come on, Finn. Talk to me. I miss hearing you speak.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Finn:</td><td> And I miss speaking in full sentences. Interjections are the focus of today's The English We Speak. Let's remember the ones I used.</td></tr>
