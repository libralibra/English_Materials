<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>Neil's performing medical experiments on Feifei. Why's he hitting her with a hammer? To teach you a useful English expression!</p>
<h3>Transcript</h3>


<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Hello and welcome to The English We Speak, I'm Neil and joining me is Feifei&hellip;</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Hello.</p>


<p><strong>Neil</strong>
<br /> I've got a medical experiment to perform on you in this programme, Feifei.</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Righhhhht&hellip;</p>


<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Come on&#151;it's for our listeners. We've got an expression which means to react to something without thinking about it carefully first. So, cross one leg over the other, like that.</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>What are you doing with that hammer?</p>


<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Keep calm&#151;it's OK, I'm not going to hurt you. And I'll just tap your knee&hellip; And&hellip; it worked!</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Yes Neil, well done. You've just tested my reflexes. When you hit my knee with the hammer, my leg kicked automatically. I didn't even think about it.</p>


<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>It was a knee-jerk reaction. And in English we can say that someone has a knee-jerk reaction when they act after an event without thinking carefully.</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Let's hear some examples of 'knee-jerk reaction'.</p>


<p><strong>Examples<br /></strong>After the terrorist attack, the government should be careful to avoid a knee-jerk reaction. A declaration of war could lead to even bigger problems later.</p>

<p>He left his wife after he saw her having a drink with another man but it was a knee-jerk reaction. He'll be back.</p>

<p>Putting up interest rates because of inflation is a knee-jerk reaction. They haven't thought of the other consequences.</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>A knee-jerk reaction. Acting automatically, without thinking about the consequences.</p>


<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Let's try that again with the other knee. Here we go&hellip; (Smacking sfx) Argh&#151;you kicked me in the face!</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Sorry Neil&#151;it was just a knee-jerk reaction.</p>


<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Ow&hellip;</p>


<p><strong>Both<br /></strong>Bye!</p>

<p></p>
