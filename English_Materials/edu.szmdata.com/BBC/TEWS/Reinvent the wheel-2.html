<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>Is Neil wasting time thinking of ideas for today's programme? Feifei thinks he's writing the same old thing&#151;but what's writing got to do with reinventing a wheel? All will be revealed in this programme&#151;if Neil finishes writing it!</p>
<h3>Transcript</h3>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Hello and welcome to The English We Speak. I'm Feifei&hellip;</p>


<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>&hellip; and&hellip; hi there&hellip; I'm Neil.</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Err&hellip; Neil, could we have your attention please?</p>


<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Sorry Feifei&#151;I'm still trying to finish the script for this programme.</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>What? You're still writing the script for this programme! So what's going to happen today then?</p>


<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Well, I thought that you could pretend to arrive late&hellip; I've lost my coffee&hellip; I just need to think of an authentic real English phrase to use now&hellip;</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Oh come on Neil, there is no need to reinvent the wheel!</p>


<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Feifei, you're amazing&#151;<strong>to reinvent the wheel</strong>&#151;that's a great English phrase. I'll use that in my script.</p>


<p><strong>Feifei
<br />To reinvent the wheel</strong> means 'to waste time trying to create something that has already been made'. So I'm saying, don't waste time writing a script that has already been written&#151;all your ideas have been written before!</p>


<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Really?</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>I'll show you&#151;but first let's hear some more examples of this phrase&hellip;</p>


<p><strong>Examples<br /></strong>Don't reinvent the wheel; we already have a plan that seems to work well.</p>

<p>He spent days working out the new course syllabus when we had planned it already&#151;he's just reinvented the wheel!</p>

<p>Nancy's new idea is just the same as the old one&#151;she's just reinvented the wheel!</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>So <strong>to reinvent the wheel</strong> means 'to waste time and effort doing something that someone has done before'. Now let me show you that old script&hellip;</p>


<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Oh yeah. Let's have a look. Arrives late&hellip; drinks coffee&hellip; I tell a joke&hellip; you're right Feifei, this is almost the same script. I'll just copy the idea for today's script.</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Actually, maybe you shouldn't reinvent the wheel&#151;and start writing something new and original.</p>


<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Sorry&#151;we're out of time Feifei. I just need to say something funny and we can go&hellip; I've had a 'wheely' good time!</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>That wasn't funny.</p>


<p><strong>Both<br /></strong>Bye!</p>
