	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Can you guess what I have brought for you to try?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> No, but I hope it's not one of those&#160;... errr, disgusting pies you always make.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Hey, come on Feifei have some faith in me. I know you like fried dumplings a lot, so I have made these pork and chive dumplings especially for you!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> Fried dumplings? They look more like burnt dumplings.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Just try one&#151;I'm sure you'll like it.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> Rob, they just don't look that appetising.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Trust me Feifei, the proof is in the pudding.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> In the pudding? Aren't these supposed to be dumplings?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Yes, these are dumplings. But I used the phrase 'the proof is in the pudding' to mean you can only judge the quality of something after you've tried it or used it.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> I see. So 'the proof is in the pudding' is actually a real saying?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Yes, it is. In the old days, people used to say 'the proof of the pudding is in the eating'&#151;which means you have to eat the pudding to know what's inside it.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> I like that saying. Although it does mean I've got to try your dumplings to know how bad they are.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Oh Feifei! Just give them a try&#151;you won't be disappointed.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> OK, OK. I'll try some. But first, let's hear some examples of how to use the phrase 'the proof is in the pudding'.</td></tr>
