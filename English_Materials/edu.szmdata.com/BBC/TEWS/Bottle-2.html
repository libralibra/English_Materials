<h3>Summary</h3>

<h3>Transcript</h3>


<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>So, big presentation today, Feifei! How are you feeling?</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Yeah, I'm ok, Neil. All prepared. I do feel a bit nervous&hellip; I just need to remind myself to slow down and take a sip of water when I feel anxious!</p>


<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Good plan! OK, I'll see you later. Good luck&hellip; Hey! So how did it go?</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Not great.</p>


<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>What happened? You lost your bottle?</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Actually, I took a glass of water.</p>


<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Oh right. You know the phrase 'to lose your bottle' means 'to lose your confidence and fail to do something, or decide not to do it'.</p>


<p><strong>Feifei</strong></p>

<p>Thanks for teaching me this phrase when I'm feeling awful.</p>


<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Yes, sorry. You can also simply say 'to bottle it' which also means 'to lose your courage and fail to do something'. Err, examples time?</p>


<p><strong>Examples<br /></strong>He was going to ask his girlfriend to marry him but lost his bottle at the last minute. She asked him instead.</p>

<p>I thought about painting my front door bright green but I bottled it. I went for a conservative grey instead.</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Anyway Neil, aren't you giving a presentation this afternoon?</p>


<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Err&#160;... I was going to.</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Oh? You mean, you're not going to do it now?</p>


<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Well, you see, I just had so much work on this week, and I've not really had time at all&hellip;</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Yeah, yeah, I get it. You bottled it.</p>


<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>You got me. I just hate presentations!</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Well, that makes two of us! Bye.</p>


<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Bye.</p>
