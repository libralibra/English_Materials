<p><strong>Helen<br /></strong>Hello and welcome to The English We Speak. I'm Helen.<strong></strong></p>


<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>And I'm Rob. Hello! Err, Helen are you feeling OK? You're looking a bit tired.</p>


<p><strong>Helen</strong>
<br /> I am. I haven't been sleeping very well. I have so much revising to do for my exams.</p>


<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>I'm sure you'll be fine.</p>


<p><strong>Helen</strong>
<br />I don't know. I've got assignments to write, exams to take&#151;and look at my house, it's a mess, I've got to tidy up.</p>


<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Oh calm down. Anyway, when are your exams?</p>


<p><strong>Helen</strong>
<br /> In three months' time!</p>


<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Three months?! That's ages. Helen, you need to take a chill pill!</p>


<p><strong>Helen</strong>
<br /> A chill pill? Oh right, let's have a look <em>(she looks through her box of medicines)</em>&#160;...&#160;paracetamol&#160;... aspirin&#160;... no&#151;I haven't got any chill pills.</p>


<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>You won't find them in there Helen. Chill pills aren't real. When you tell someone to take a chill pill, you are telling them to calm down and relax. So Helen&#160;... relax&#160;... chill!</p>


<p><strong>Helen</strong>
<br /> Oh right, thanks. So the doctor isn't going to give me one?</p>


<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Well, I'm sure he could give you something to help you relax but this idiom is just a saying to give someone some friendly advice, as you can hear in these examples&#160;...&#160;</p>


<p><strong>Examples</strong></p>

<p>Stop shouting at the referee and take a chill pill.</p>

<p>She was getting so stressed about what her boss said to her that I told her to just take a chill pill&#151;everything would be fine.</p>

<p>My wife's working so hard, she needs to take a chill pill, otherwise she'll make herself ill.</p>


<p><strong>Helen</strong>
<br /> OK, so we know to take a chill pill really means to relax or calm down. You're right Rob, I will take a chill pill and I will chill out&#160;...&#160;</p>


<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>That's good to hear.</p>


<p><strong>Helen</strong>
<br /> Yes, in fact, I think I'll go shopping, get my hair done, maybe book a holiday&#160;... there's no point worrying about some silly exams is there? See you later Rob.</p>


<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Hold on Helen. I think perhaps you've taken too many chill pills?! I mean, these are quite important exams and you need good grades if you want to get a better job&#160;...&#160;</p>


<p><strong>Helen</strong>
<br /> Oh relax Rob&#160;... you know what you need to take?</p>


<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>A chill pill?</p>


<p><strong>Helen</strong>
<br /> You said it!</p>


<p><strong>Both<br /></strong>Bye!</p>
