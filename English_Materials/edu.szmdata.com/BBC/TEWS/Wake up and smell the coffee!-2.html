	<tr><td class="roles">Jen:</td><td> Hi I’m Jen and with me today is Li. Did you get my text message this morning?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Hi Jen, yes, and I’ve brought everything you mentioned.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Jen:</td><td> What, I didn’t ask you for anything?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> <ignoring Jen> I’ve got you this great alarm clock and I’ve made this lovely pot of coffee&#151;would you like a cup?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Jen:</td><td> Er&#160;... No thanks&#160;... But Li, I didn’t tell you to bring anything today.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> You did. Look&#151;you said <pushing buttons on phone>: “The boss asked to see you in his office&#160;... I think you need to wake up and smell the coffee!”&#160;...&#160;</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Jen:</td><td> Yes&#160;... but&#160;...&#160;</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> So I’ve brought some coffee and an alarm clock for when I see the boss, to show him I can wake up and smell the coffee.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Jen:</td><td> I didn’t mean it literally. When we say ‘wake up and smell the coffee’ in English, it means that you need to pay attention because you’re missing something that’s really obvious.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> So when you tell me to “wake up and smell the coffee,” you think something’s going on that I don’t realise.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Jen:</td><td> Exactly. Let’s hear some examples:</td></tr>
	<tr><td/><td class="examples">Wake up and smell the coffee&#151;she doesn’t want to go out with you!</td></tr>
	<tr><td/><td class="examples">My girlfriend wants me to buy her some diamond earrings, but I’ve got no money, she really needs to wake up and smell the coffee!</td></tr><p>
<br /><strong>Li:</strong> So if this man’s girlfriend needs to ‘wake up and smell the coffee’, she needs to realise he can’t afford to buy her the earrings she wants.

	<tr><td class="roles">Jen:</td><td> Now you’ve got it!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Ok, so in your text you said that I need to wake up and smell the coffee because the boss wants to see me?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Jen:</td><td> Yeah&#160;...&#160;</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> So you think I’m missing something&#160;...&#160;</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Jen:</td><td> Think about it&#160;... he said he loves your work, he is always talking about how talented you are, how he wants to reward his staff&#160;... wake up and smell the coffee, Li!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> I just don’t know what you are getting at.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Jen:</td><td> I mean I think he’s going to give you a pay rise.</td></tr>
