	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> It's tasty! Italian cheese&#151;my favourite.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Finn:</td><td> Thank you, Li. But, I'm sorry, I'm just in a terrible mood today. Do you know I have to spend the whole weekend writing a report?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Oh really&#160;...&#160;?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Finn:</td><td> Well, the boss said my first draft wasn't good enough and asked me to do the whole thing again by Monday!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Not much fun. Sorry Finn. Are you sure you don't want some cheese?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Finn:</td><td> No. No cheese for me, thanks. I'm&#160;... I'm really cheesed off!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Cheesed off? Is that a medical problem&#160;...&#160;? You can't eat cheese?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Finn:</td><td> No. In English, 'to be cheesed off' means to be really annoyed. I'm so cheesed off! You can also say 'to cheese someone off'&#151;so, writing reports really cheeses me off.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> So&#160;... now I know why you're cheesed off.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Finn:</td><td> Yes, 'cheesed off' is today's expression in Authentic Real English. Let's hear some examples of how it's used.</td></tr>
