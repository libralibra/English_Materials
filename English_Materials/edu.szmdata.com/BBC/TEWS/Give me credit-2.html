<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>Li offers to buy Rob something using her credit card&#151;but Rob's looking for another type of credit. What can it be? Join them in this programme to hear another English phrase in use.</p>
<h3>Transcript</h3>

<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>Hello, this is The English We Speak with me Li&#160;...&#160;</p>

<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>And me Rob. So Li, here we are, shopping again&#160;... So, what is it you're going to buy today?</p>

<p><strong>Li <br /></strong>Me? No, I thought you wanted to buy something? You said to me this morning <strong>give me credit</strong>&#151;so here we are, all my credit cards, look, including my gold one&#151;impressive, hey?</p>

<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Yes. But Li, I didn't actually mean&#160;...&#160;</p>

<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>(Interrupting) So I'll buy something on my credit card and you can pay me back later&#151;that's <strong>giving you credit</strong>&#151;right?</p>

<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Err, wrong Li. Although it's a nice idea. <strong>To give me credit</strong> means give me praise or appreciation for something I've done. And this morning I walked the dog, washed the car, did the shopping, and I still got to work at 9 o'clock! So please, give me credit!</p>

<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>OK, I'll have a think about whether you deserve credit while we hear some more examples of this phrase in action&#160;...&#160;</p>

<p><strong>Examples<br /></strong>We must <strong>give credit to</strong> our sponsors who helped pay for this new building.</p>
<p>I'll <strong>give her credit</strong> for her beautiful handwriting, but the answers she gave in the test were all wrong!</p>

<p><strong>Give me credit</strong>&#151;I worked all night to get the project finished!</p>

<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>So to give someone credit means to give them praise. I get the word <strong>credit</strong> now Rob. This has nothing to do with money, so I'll put away my credit cards&#160;... I'm not going to give you financial credit <em>or</em> credit in terms of praise.</p>

<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>No praise? Why's that?</p>

<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>You didn't walk the dog because you haven't got one, the car is still dirty, and I did all the shopping! So don't take the credit for things you haven't done!</p>

<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>OK. Well, here's another phrase for you&#151;<strong>give credit where it's due</strong>&#160;...&#160;</p>

<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>Meaning?</p>

<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>You should at least acknowledge the things I <em>have</em> done&#151;like turning up at the studio today to record this programme!</p>

<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>Of course, Rob, you are a credit to the BBC!</p>

<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Ahh, thanks Li. Err&#160;... any chance I could borrow your credit card now?</p>

<p><strong>Both<br /></strong>Bye!</p>
