	<tr><td/><td class="examples">Hey there, don't look so sad! Why the long face?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> So "why the long face?" is just another way of asking "what's the matter?"</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Jen:</td><td> Exactly. You could also say "what's up?"</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> That's very simple&#151;you could say "what's wrong?" too.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Jen:</td><td> So what IS wrong? Why do you look so miserable?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> I've just had a really bad day&#151;everything has gone wrong. First I lost my car keys, then I was late for a meeting and I fell over and tripped and landed in a puddle on my way. It was a horrible day.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Jen:</td><td> It sounds awful. I know, how about I tell you a joke to cheer you up&#151;you'll like this one.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> OK, why not. Let's hear it.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Jen:</td><td> A horse walks into a bar. The barman says: "why the long face?"</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> So the horse was unhappy? What's funny about that?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Jen:</td><td> The barman says to the horse "Why the long face?"</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> Why would a horse be in a bar?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Jen:</td><td> It doesn't matter&#151;it's a joke. It's a horse so the barman says "Why the long face?"</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> I don't understand.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Jen:</td><td> Well, the horse has a long face.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> So it's unhappy?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Jen:</td><td> No, well, yes, but that's the joke. Horses have long faces.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> So why did it go into the bar again&#160;...&#160;?</td></tr>
