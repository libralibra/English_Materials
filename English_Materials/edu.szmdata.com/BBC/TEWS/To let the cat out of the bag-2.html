	<tr><td class="roles">Will:</td><td> Well I wanted to explain an English phrase. And I brought Whiskers to help.</td></tr>

	<tr><td class="roles">Graciela:</td><td> Well he's not very happy about being stuffed into that bag. You'd better hurry up and explain your phrase.</td></tr>

	<tr><td class="roles">Will:</td><td> No, no. I mean in English, when we say 'you mustn't let the cat out of the bag', it means that something is a secret and that you mustn't tell anyone.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Graciela:</td><td> Ah, so it doesn't literally mean there is a cat in a bag. It just means that there's a secret that must be kept.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Cat:</td><td> Miaow.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Will:</td><td> Exactly. And I brought Whiskers in just to help you remember the expression. If you let the cat out of the bag, it means that you reveal a secret. Listen to some examples.</td></tr>
	<tr><td/><td class="examples">We need to keep this quiet! If anyone lets the cat out of the bag there'll be trouble!</td></tr>

	<tr><td class="roles">Graciela:</td><td> Owwwwww!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Will:</td><td> I actually meant it when I said don't let the cat out of the bag. Whiskers is a bit crazy.</td></tr>
