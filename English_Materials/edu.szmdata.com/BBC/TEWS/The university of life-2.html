<h3>Transcript</h3>


<p><strong>Rob</strong>
<br />Hello welcome to The English We Speak from BBC Learning English. I'm Rob.</p>

<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Oh hello&hellip;I'm Feifei.</p>

<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>What's wrong Feifei?</p>

<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>I'm stressed&#151;I've got an exam tomorrow&#151;I hate exams.</p>

<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Me too. What you need to do is plan your revision a bit more, take lots of breaks, and maybe go for a run.</p>

<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>You seem to know a lot about preparing for exams. Where did you study?</p>

<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Oh nowhere you would have heard of. It's called the university of life.</p>

<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>The university of life. Is that in London?</p>

<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>It's doesn't actually exist&#151;when someone says they've been to the university of life it means they are wise but not necessarily educated&#151;they've learnt everything just from experiencing life.</p>

<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>I see. Hmm, so no exams.</p>

<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>That's right. I've just got a qualification in life! Let's hear some more examples of this phrase&hellip;</p>


<p><strong>Examples<br /></strong>I set up the business without any qualifications&#151;everything I learnt was from the university of life.</p>
<p>The university of life taught me to be polite to everyone you meet; you never know when you might see them again.</p>

<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>The university of life&#151;it's where you learn from life not books. So I should learn a lesson from you Rob?</p>

<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Yes, chill out&#151;don't stress about exams&#151;they're a waste of time.</p>

<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Really!!! Hold on a minute. If I remember correctly, you failed your exams and you were kicked out of university.</p>

<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Well&hellip;err&hellip; maybe. But that was a life experience&hellip; and I learned that studying wasn't for me.</p>

<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Hmmm, it sounds like you've been to The school of hard knocks.</p>

<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>The school of hard knocks?</p>

<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Yes, it's an unpleasant experience that you learn from. Anyway, I'm off to revise for my exams&#151;I'd rather stay at my university rather than go to yours!</p>

<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Fair enough.</p>

<p><strong>Both<br /></strong>Bye.</p>
