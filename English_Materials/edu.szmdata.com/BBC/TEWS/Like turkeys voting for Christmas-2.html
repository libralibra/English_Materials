<p><span><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Hello and welcome to <em>The English We Speak</em>where we teach you English words and phrases which you might not find in your dictionary. I'm Rob.</span></p>

<p><span><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>&hellip; and I'm Feifei. Hello.</span></p>

<p><span><strong>Rob<br /></strong>I am getting very excited, it's nearly Christmas.</span></p>

<p><span><strong>Feifei <br /></strong>I love Christmas! All the food, the presents, the silly games and the&hellip;</span></p>

<p><span><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Oh, Feifei, did you hear the boss wants us to agree to work on Christmas Day?</span></p>

<p><span><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Really? Why? I would never agree to that!</span></p>

<p><span><strong>Rob<br /></strong>I don't know, but he wanted us to agree to it. So I told him us agreeing to work on Christmas Day would be like turkeys voting for Christmas.</span></p>

<p><span><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>'Like turkeys voting for Christmas'? Rob, I know you like your turkey dinner but what's this got to do with turkeys?</span></p>

<p><span><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Let me explain, Feifei. As you know, lots of people eat turkeys at Christmas. So, do you think if the turkeys had a choice, they would vote for Christmas?</span></p>

<p><span><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>No, of course not, it would be crazy for them to vote for Christmas because they get eaten.</span></p>

<p><span><strong>Rob<br /></strong>That's right. So in English, we use this idiom 'like turkeys voting for Christmas' as a metaphor when someone accepts a situation which will have a negative outcome for them.</span></p>

<p><span><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Ah, so in our case, if we agree to work on Christmas Day then we can't have the food, the presents or the drinks; more importantly, we can't spend time with our family which will be really disappointing for us.</span></p>

<p><span><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Exactly! It will be 'like turkeys voting for Christmas'. Let's hear some people using this phrase.</span></p>

<p><span><strong>Examples<br /></strong><em>Workers agreeing to pay cuts would be like turkeys voting for Christmas.</em></span></p>

<p><em>It would be like turkeys voting for Christmas if people asked for a tax rise.</em></p>


<p><strong><span>Rob
<br /></span></strong><span>Remember this is an informal saying so do take note of the context it's used in.</span></p>


<p><strong><span>Feifei
<br /></span></strong><span>Thank you Rob for teaching us this humorous idiom. All this talking of turkey is making me very hungry.</span></p>


<p><strong><span>Rob
<br /></span></strong><span>Me too, maybe we should just skip work today and go find some turkey to eat?</span></p>


<p><strong><span>Feifei
<br /></span></strong><span>Now Rob, if I said yes to that, it would really be like turkeys voting for Christmas.</span></p>


<p><strong><span>Rob
<br /></span></strong><span>Ha ha&hellip;</span></p>

<p><span><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Do join us again for another <em>The English We Speak</em>. We wish you a very Happy Christmas!</span></p>
