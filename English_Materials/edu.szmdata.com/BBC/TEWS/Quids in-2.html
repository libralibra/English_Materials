	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Hi! I'm Rob. And this is Helen!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> Hello.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Now come on Helen, we've no time to waste. This jumble sale has nearly finished and we haven't got any bargains yet.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> Yes, all I've bought is an old teddy bear and a hat with a hole in it. A jumble sale is a great place to pick up some second-hand goods but make sure they are things you want! So what are you looking for Rob?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Some antique pots and vases. Then I can sell it to someone else and I'll be quids in!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> What? Quids in? What a strange saying.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> It means I'll be in profit&#151;or I will have made or saved some money through some kind of financial transaction.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> I like the sound of that. But did you say squids in&#151;like the creature in the sea&#151;a squid?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> No Helen, the word is quids&#151;it's a slang word for pounds. A quid is £1. You might hear people talking about it like this:</td></tr>
	<tr><td/><td class="examples">I'm broke so can you lend me a quid to buy a cup of tea&#151;please?</td></tr>
	<tr><td/><td class="examples">Come on ladies, who wants these lovely strawberries? Only two quid a box.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> So a quid is a pound and if I am quids in it means I will have made some extra pounds sterling.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> Ah! Why didn't you say? Quids in means you could be rich!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Possibly. Let's hear some other people who are hoping to be quids in:</td></tr>
	<tr><td/><td class="examples">If we complete this deal, we'll be quids in!</td></tr>
	<tr><td/><td class="examples">With such a good exchange rate you'll be quids in when you go abroad on holiday.</td></tr>
<ul>
	<li><em>I paid £50 for it but sold it for £60 so I'm quids in!</em></li>
</ul>
<table border="0">
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> OK Rob, if we're going to be quids in today we need to get buying things.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Did I say 'we'? Anyway, look at this old vase&#151;it's only £10. I could clean it up and sell it for £20.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> Sounds fantastic. We really would be quids in then. Come on then let's buy it.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Right OK, I've got my bargain for today, let's go home.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> Rob watch that step!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Whoa! Oh no, my vase&#151;it's broken.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> Oh! Do you think you'll be able to get £20 for it now?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> No, I won't even get a penny.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> Rob won't be making a profit on selling his old vase now it's broken. He'll be quids out!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Sorry, what did you say?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> Is there such an expression as being quids out?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> No there isn't! But there is an expression about being <em>out of pocket</em>.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> Hmm, I think we'll leave that for another day. Come on Rob I'll buy you a drink to cheer you up.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Thanks Helen. See you next time on The English We Speak. Bye.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> Bye!</td></tr>
