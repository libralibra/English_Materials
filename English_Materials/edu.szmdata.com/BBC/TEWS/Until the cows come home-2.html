<p class="storyTitle">Until the cows come home</p>
<p><em>(Neil has spent Sunday with Li in the countryside. Now they are going back to town.)</em></p>
<table border="0">
	<tr><td class="roles">Neil:</td><td> It's been a great Sunday in the countryside, Li. I'm a city boy&#151;I'm not used to this much walking and fresh air. It was good though, but now it's getting late.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Yes, it is, Neil. But now we are going to catch a bus to town and you'll be back in your normal environment.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Neil:</td><td> Well, where is this bus?! You said you knew this area. We've been here on this dirt road for a while and no buses have passed by. No vehicles at all, actually.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Don't worry, Neil. The bus will come.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Neil:</td><td>Li, look! There is a note here on the wall of this old bus shelter!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td>Oh, I didn't notice it. What does it say?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Neil:</td><td> It says buses are subject to delays! We'll be waiting for a bus until the cows come home!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Those cows?! I think they are already home, Neil. The cows live in that field. It's us who need to go home. You might be feeling a bit light-headed as you are not used to so much fresh air.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Neil:</td><td>Li, we are not actually waiting for the cows to go anywhere. In English, to wait 'until the cows come home' means to wait for a very long time.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Ah, so nothing to do with the cows?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Neil:</td><td>Not at all. Let's hear some examples of how to use 'until the cows come home', today's expression in The English We Speak.</td></tr>
	<tr><td/><td class="examples">I'm off work tomorrow so tonight we can party until the cows come home!</td></tr>
	<tr><td/><td class="examples">Alan is very stubborn. His wife can try to persuade him until the cows come home but he won't change his mind.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td>Oh.That's a new expression for me. And you learnt something too, Neil.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Neil:</td><td> What's that, Li?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td>Look over there!</td></tr>

<p><em>(The bus is approaching.)</em></p>
<table border="0">
	<tr><td class="roles">Neil:</td><td> That's our bus! Here, here! We're over here!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Don't worry, it's coming.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Neil:</td><td> Well, you learnt a new expression and I learnt to be more patient.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td>One day, even a city boy like you will get used to the calming and relaxing atmosphere of the countryside.<strong></strong></td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Neil:</td><td>Yes. The cows look happy, don't they? Munching away on the grass&#160;...&#160;</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td>Yes, indeed. Let's go. Bye.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Neil:</td><td> Bye.</td></tr>
