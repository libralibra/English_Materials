	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td>Hello, and welcome to The English We Speak. My name is Helen.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td>And I'm Rob. Helen, you look like you've been rushing. Here, have some water.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> Oh thanks. I'm a bit out of breath. My appointment at the bank took longer than expected.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td>You got here just in the nick of time then.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td>Just in the nick of time? Shouldn't it be just in time?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td>You can say both. It means at the very last moment. Let's hear how this phrase is used.</td></tr>
	<tr>
		<td/>
		<td>
			<table border="0" class="examples">
				<tr><td class="roles">Woman&#160;1:</td><td>Alice gave birth to a baby girl last night.</td></tr>
				<tr><td class="roles">Woman&#160;2:</td><td>I thought she wasn't due for another three weeks.</td></tr>
				<tr><td class="roles">Woman&#160;1:</td><td>It was early and they got to the hospital just in the nick of time.</td></tr>
				<tr><td class="roles">Man:</td><td>Sarah and I were on our way to see Beyonce in concert. But she left her mobile in the office, so we had to go back and get it.</td></tr>
				<tr><td class="roles">Woman:</td><td>Did you miss the show?</td></tr>
				<tr><td class="roles">Man:</td><td>Thankfully not, we got there just in the nick of time.</td></tr>
			</table>
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td>In the first example, we heard one woman got to the hospital just before her baby was born. And in the second example, a couple nearly missed their Beyonce concert.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td>That would've been awful. You hear this phrase often used to suggest a disaster had been averted. If the action happened any later, then something awful could happen.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> I see. I have another question&#151;is this phrase a British expression?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td>I don't think the phrase 'in the nick of time' is specifically British. It originated from the UK, but English speakers from all over the world use it.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> Let's listen to a few more examples then.</td></tr>
	<tr>
		<td/>
		<td>
			<table border="0" class="examples">
				<tr><td class="roles">Man:</td><td>We arrived just in the nick of time. Another five minutes, our plane would have left without us.</td></tr>
				<tr><td class="roles">Woman:</td><td>Sam was experimenting with stir frying last night and the wok caught fire. Luke rushed in with the fire blanket just in the nick of time.</td></tr>
			</table>
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td>That was close. Stir frying can get pretty hot sometimes. And it's good that Luke didn't try to put out the fire with water.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> That would have been a catastrophe. So Helen, are you the kind of person who likes to do things at the very last minute?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> Well, I'd like to think of myself as a person who can do things in the nick of time. Thanks for listening. Bye.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Bye.</td></tr>
