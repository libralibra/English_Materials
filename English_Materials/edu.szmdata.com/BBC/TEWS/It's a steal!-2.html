<p>Note: This is not a word-for-word transcript</p>


<p><strong>Feifei</strong>
<br />Hello, this is The English We Speak, with me Feifei&hellip;</p>


<p><strong>Neil</strong>
<br />&hellip; and me Neil. Hello!</p>


<p><strong>Feifei</strong>
<br />Neil, what a nice mobile phone you have with you! Wow! Very flashy! Gold colour!</p>


<p><strong>Neil</strong>
<br />It's brilliant! The battery lasts a long time. It's got loads of memory&#151;it has plenty of room for apps, pictures, videos&hellip; And the camera is great too!</p>


<p><strong>Feifei</strong>
<br />It must have cost a fortune!</p>


<p><strong>Neil</strong>
<br />Not at all, it was a steal!</p>


<p><strong>Feifei</strong>
<br />Neil!!!! Oh, you shouldn't have done that! You're such a nice guy. Why would you do something like that? You could have taken out a loan to buy it or something, but&hellip;</p>


<p><strong>Neil</strong>
<br />What do you mean?</p>

<p>(Sound of a police car siren)</p>


<p><strong>Feifei</strong>
<br />They are here! They've come for you!</p>


<p><strong>Neil</strong>
<br />No that was just a sound effect. I'm just having a joke with you&#151;I'm not going to be arrested! In English, when you say something is 'a steal' you mean it's a bargain&#151;so cheap that it's almost as if you haven't paid anything for it.</p>


<p><strong>Feifei</strong>
<br />Oh, you're so naughty!</p>


<p><strong>Neil</strong>
<br />Sorry Feifei, it was just a joke. Let's hear examples of how this expression is used.</p>


<p><strong>Examples<br /></strong>I got this designer shirt in the sales. At &pound;100 cheaper than the original price it's a steal!</p>

<p>This is the latest model, sir. You won't find this new computer cheaper in any other shop in the high street. It's a steal!</p>


<p><strong>Neil</strong>
<br />See?</p>


<p><strong>Feifei</strong>
<br />Yes. 'It's a steal' means it's a bargain.</p>


<p><strong>Neil</strong>
<br />So, as I was saying, my phone was so cheap. My phone!!! Where is it?! I had it right here where has it gone?!</p>


<p><strong>Feifei</strong>
<br />Yeah&#151;where is it? &hellip; It was right there&hellip;</p>

<p>(Sound of a police car siren)</p>


<p><strong>Neil</strong>
<br />Yes! Now I really do need to call the police.</p>


<p><strong>Feifei</strong>
<br />No, you don't. Your phone is here! I hid it when you got distracted.</p>


<p><strong>Neil</strong>
<br />Nice one Feifei&#151;revenge for my phone joke at the beginning. And for the listeners&#151;don't steal anything. 'It's a steal' is just an expression.</p>


<p><strong>Both</strong>
<br />Bye!</p>
