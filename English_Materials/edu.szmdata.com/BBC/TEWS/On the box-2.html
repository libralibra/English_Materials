<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>Neil and Feifei are moving house and they're surrounded by cardboard boxes. Feifei has had enough of packing. So when Neil makes a suggestion involving another 'box', Feifei isn't happy!</p>
<h3>Transcript</h3>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Plates&hellip; OK. Spoons&hellip; all packed. That's one box full. The kitchen is finished, Neil!</p>


<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>All packed? Well done. Now let's move on to the bedroom.</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>OK&hellip; I'm exhausted. In today's The English We Speak, Neil and I are moving house, and there's just so much packing to do. The house is full of cardboard boxes!</p>


<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>I know, I know Feifei. Listen, let's just finish this room and then we can sit down, relax and see what's on the box.</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Neil, the last thing I want to do is look at any more boxes! I need a break.</p>


<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Oh, of course. What I meant was: see what's on TV! 'On the box' is a slang expression meaning 'on TV'.</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Ok, why didn't you just say 'on TV'?! Anyway, let's play some examples while we finish packing.</p>


<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Good idea.</p>


<p><strong>Examples<br /></strong>A: See anything good on the box last night?
<br />B: Yeah! There was this great new series about spies.</p>

<p>A: What are you up to tonight?
<br />B: Not much, just gonna relax in front of the box.</p>


<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Yes&#151;you can also relax 'in front of the box', which means in front of the television. And which reminds me, Feifei: where is the box, I mean, our TV?</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Oh, oh yes. I, err&hellip; packed it away already. But I don't remember which box I put it in.</p>


<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>You mean the box, is in&hellip; a box? But we've packed 20 boxes already. Which one is it in?</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Sorry! Let's just finish packing and then go out for dinner.</p>


<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Yes, I've had enough of these boxes too, bye.</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Bye!</p>
