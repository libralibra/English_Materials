<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>Rob and Feifei are playing cards and he is winning every single game. She's distracted&#151;until Neil tells her what's on the cards!</p>
<h3>Transcript</h3>

<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Hello and welcome to The English We Speak. I'm Rob and I've won yet another card game! Yes!</p>

<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Hello everyone. I'm Feifei and I've just lost to him again&#160;...&#160;</p>

<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>It's not surprising. You've been very distracted all morning.</p>

<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>There's a promotion coming up and I wonder if I'll get it.</p>

<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Well, you work hard Feifei. I'm sure a promotion is on the cards.</p>

<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>It's on the cards?! But I haven't been paying much attention to them! Which cards?</p>

<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>No, it's not actually written on any cards. It's an expression. In British English, we say something 'is ON the cards'&#151;or 'IN the cards' in American English&#151;when we mean that something is likely to happen.</p>

<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>So you mean that it's possible and even likely that I'll get a promotion because I work hard?</p>

<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Yes. Here are some examples of how this expression is used:</p>

<p><strong>Examples<br /></strong>Wage rises are on the cards in the UK. There are now signs that things are getting better for ordinary British workers.</p>
<p>My son might be ready to settle down. He's had lots of girlfriends but now he's going steady with a colleague and a wedding might be on the cards.</p>

<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Great! So I'm likely to get that promotion. It's on the cards!</p>

<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Yes. And there's something else on the cards today.</p>

<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Oh really, what is it?</p>

<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>I'm going to win another round of this game! Look, I've got three aces now!</p>

<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>OK. You deserve it. You are a good player and have luck on your side. Another win is definitely on the cards!</p>

<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Great! I'm on a roll!</p>

<p><strong>Both<br /></strong>Bye!</p>
