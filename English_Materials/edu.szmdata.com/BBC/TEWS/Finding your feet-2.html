	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> Hello and welcome to The English We Speak. Rosie and I are doing a salsa class tonight. It's my favourite Latin American dance and I love the music!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rosie:</td><td> Yes, and it's not easy&#160;... One, two, three! Oh, I'm not very good yet&#151;I'm still finding my feet.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> You're still finding your feet? No wonder you're so bad. How can you dance if you don't know where your feet are?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rosie:</td><td> I do know where my feet are, Helen. When you say you're finding your feet in English, it means you're becoming confident at something.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> So if I say I'm still finding my feet, it means I'm still getting used to a new situation&#160;... which might not have anything to do with feet?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rosie:</td><td> That's right. And when you say you've found your feet, it means you've become familiar with a situation.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> Let's have a look at some examples then:</td></tr>
</table>
<ul>
	<li>Lauren has only been at her new job for four days, so she's still finding her feet.</li>
	<li>My daughter started secondary school two weeks ago, but she's already found her feet. She's made loads of new friends and really likes her teachers.</li>
	<li>“I've been living in Egypt for a year but I still can't speak Arabic very well.” “I'm sure you'll find your feet soon.”</li>
</ul>
<table border="0">
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> So finding your feet has nothing to do with your actual feet&#151;you can use it when you start a new job or when you're doing something new.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rosie:</td><td> That's right&#160;... And I feel like I'm getting quite good at salsa now.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> Really? It looks like you're still finding your feet&#160;...&#160;</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rosie:</td><td> I might ask someone to dance with me, Helen. That guy over there is pretty good. Hi, would you like to dance?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Man:</td><td> Oh, OK.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rosie:</td><td> Oooooh this is fun. One, two, three&#160;... Oops sorry! Did I step on your foot?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Man:</td><td> Ouch!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> It looks like Rosie's doing more than finding her feet&#151;she's finding other people's feet and stepping on them too!</td></tr>
