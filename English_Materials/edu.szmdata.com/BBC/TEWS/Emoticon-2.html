	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> That's right.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Vera:</td><td> And then you wrote: "With my beautiful voice, nobody will miss yours." That's a horrible thing to say, Rob!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Well, it would be horrible if it was a serious message. But haven't you noticed my emoticon at the end of the message?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Vera:</td><td> Emoticon? I have the message printed out here&#160;... Yes, I can see here in the email that you typed a colon, followed by a hyphen and a closing bracket. And when I look at it sideways I can see&#160;... a smiley face&#160;...&#160;:-) It's an emoticon! It was a joke after all!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Yes. Emoticons were created precisely for this purpose, to avoid misunderstandings like the one we've just had. I wrote my message as a joke and you took it seriously.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Vera:</td><td> I read recently that emoticons were created 30 years ago by a professor at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. Emoticon is a combination of the words 'emotional' and 'icon'.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> And indicates if a message is serious or a joke. When you speak, you can express if you're serious about what you are saying but sometimes it is difficult to achieve that on paper. Listen to some verbal examples.</td></tr>

<br /><strong>Vera:</strong> When you say something, you can convey the spirit with the tone of your voice. But sometimes it is not clear when it is written.
<table border="0">
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> But it's good to point out that emoticons are still an informal sort of message. It might not look good if you use them in a message to your boss or include them in your CV.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Vera:</td><td>That's indeed a good thing to keep in mind. We should be careful when using emoticons.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Emoticons have become so popular that there are over a hundred of them. Some with a proper round yellow face.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Vera:</td><td> Now that our misunderstanding has been sorted out, we should go out and celebrate! The 30th anniversary of the emoticon is a good excuse for some coffee and cake.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> And let's celebrate our friendship too. A friendship saved by an emoticon&#151;a smiley face in fact. Bye.</td></tr>
