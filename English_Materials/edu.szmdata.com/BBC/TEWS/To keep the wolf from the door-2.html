<h3>Transcript</h3>

<p>Note: This is not a word-for-word transcript.</p>

<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>Hello and welcome to The English We Speak with me Li&hellip;</p>

<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>&hellip;and me Rob. I suppose we had better explain an authentic English phrase then.</p>

<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>Oh cheer up Rob&#151;why are you sounding so miserable?</p>

<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Well I wasn't going to say anything but&hellip; well, I've got problems&hellip; financial problems.</p>

<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>I'm sorry to hear that, what's happened?</p>

<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>I had to get my car fixed, I had to get a plumber round to fix a leaking pipe, I received a huge tax bill and then to add to it all, I lost my wallet yesterday&#151;I'm doing my best to keep the wolf from the door.</p>

<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>A wolf?! You really have got problems if you've got to keep a wolf out of your house!</p>

<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Not a real wolf. When people say they're trying to keep the wolf from the door they mean they've only just got enough money to survive.</p>

<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>Oh I see! So you just have enough money to eat and live?</p>

<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Yes, it's not a good position to be in. Let's hear more examples of the phrase in action&hellip;</p>

<p><strong>Examples<br /></strong>I'm going to have to sell my car if I'm to keep the wolf from the door.</p>
<p>It's tough being a student, I study all day then have to do an evening job just to keep the wolf from the door.</p>
<p>We've only just saved enough money to keep the wolf from the door.</p>

<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>So if you keep the wolf from the door, you just have enough money to survive. OK Rob, I get it&hellip; with all your bills to pay you really are struggling to keep the wolf from the door&#151;so what are you going to do?</p>

<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>I need to ask a good friend to lend me some money.</p>

<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>You want to borrow some money? You'll need to find a really good friend then?</p>

<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Yes a <em>really</em> good friend&#151;like you Li? I know you have some spare cash.</p>

<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>Sorry Rob, I've just spent that on a <em>really</em> nice holiday.</p>
<p>(Sound of wolf knocking at the door)</p>

<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Huh! What's that?</p>

<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>It sounds like the wolf is <em>really</em> at the door. Go on then, here's ten pounds.</p>

<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>(disappointed) Oh thanks!</p>

<p><strong>Both<br /></strong>Bye!</p>
