	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Hello and welcome to The English We Speak, I'm Li. And here with me is Neil. Hi Neil!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Neil:</td><td> Hi Li! But before we start the programme I've got some good news for you. I've just fixed your bike tyres as I promised! It wasn't easy to find the punctures on them but I managed to do it and the bike, I have to say, is as good as new!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Oh, great! I am so happy, Neil! You know, I use the bicycle every day. I ride it when I come to work and when I go home. You know, I took it to the mechanic last week to have it fixed and he didn't do it properly. Thank you! You are a star!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Neil:</td><td> It wasn't easy but I am glad to have been of service. Well, you told me that you'd pay me for the work so now would be a good time to do that because actually I am a bit short of cash at the moment, you know.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Oh, you want to receive some payment? Yes, I remember that I promised you'd get paid. That's fair. Okay. Here you are!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Neil:</td><td> What are these?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Your payment, Neil.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Neil:</td><td> Peanuts?!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Yes, Neil. You keep saying that there are people who work for peanuts!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Neil:</td><td> Yes I have said that on occasions but it's got nothing to do with food! To work for peanuts is an expression in English that means to work for a very small payment.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Now you tell me, Neil! So people are not really paid in peanuts, are they?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Neil:</td><td> No, they are not! Just think. A peanut is something small and cheap.</td></tr></td></tr>

				<tr><td class="roles">Woman&#160;1:</td><td>My cousin is a catwalk model and she travels all over the world!
<br />Woman 2: She must be a millionaire!
<br />Woman 1: Yes, she is! But before she become famous she used to work for peanuts! She could hardly buy a lipstick.
<br />&#160;...&#160;&#160;...&#160;.
<br />Man: I am going to ask for a pay rise. I am tired of working for peanuts!</td></tr>

	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Oh, I am sorry, Neil, when you said that some people work for peanuts I thought you wanted to be paid in peanuts!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Neil:</td><td> That's alright Li. But now that you know that I don't work for peanuts will you give me some money?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Yes, of course I will. I left my wallet in my drawer in the office but as soon as we finish this programme I'll pay you with cash. So give me back my peanuts then.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Neil:</td><td> (sound of chewing)</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Neil, the peanuts! I am hungry!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Neil:</td><td> I am hungry too and these peanuts taste great!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> I know they do. You know, I bought them in the new grocery shop around the corner.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Neil:</td><td> Don't worry, Li. As soon as you pay me we can go down there and I'll buy you some of these delicious peanuts myself.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Okay. I don't work for peanuts either but I am glad to eat some. Let's go then.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Neil:</td><td> (sound of monkey) I want more peanuts! (sound of monkey)</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> So do I, Neil, but why are you making this odd noise? You sound like a monkey!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Neil:</td><td> Well, you know what they say: if you pay peanuts you get monkeys.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Okay, I got the message. Let's go. Bye!</td></tr>
