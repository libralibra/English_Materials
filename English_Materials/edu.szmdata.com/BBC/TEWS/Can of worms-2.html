	<tr><td class="roles">Finn:</td><td> Yeah, yeah, yeah, we'll come to that in a minute. But, did you know earthworms, the kind you normally find in the soil, are both male and female in one body?</td></tr>

	<tr><td class="roles">Finn:</td><td> And if you cut a worm in half&#151;only one part of the worm will die!</td></tr>

Frank realised he'd opened a can of worms.</em></li>

	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> That was possibly the longest example we've had on The English We Speak!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Finn:</td><td> Yes, well anyway&#151;I hope everyone listening understands the phrase now. I think I'll get back to my reading. 34,000 different kinds of worm, wow&#160;... They can live for up to 10 years! Fascinating&#160;... They eat their own weight every day&#160;...&#160;</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> OK, well I think we've lost Finn there. I think I've had enough of worms for one day. Do join us again for more The English We Speak! Bye.</td></tr>
