<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>Do you have a false friend? In The English We Speak we get to hear how one of Feifei's best friends isn't a friend at all and discover that there's a great word to describe them.</p>
<h3>Transcript</h3>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Hello, welcome to The English We Speak, I'm Feifei&hellip;</p>


<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>&hellip;and hello, I'm Neil. So Feifei, did you enjoy Jane's leaving party last night?</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Oh yeah, it was great. Free food and free drink&hellip;</p>


<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>But that was the only reason was it? Weren't you sad to see her leave? You've worked with her for many years.</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Oh&hellip; right&hellip; yes. Very sad. Such a shame to see her go. We were such good friends.</p>


<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Friends! Really? Didn't she tell the boss when you took that extra-long lunch break?</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Oh yeah&#151;but generally, we were best buddies.</p>


<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Hmm, and didn't you once punch her when she tried to chat up your boyfriend at the Christmas party?</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>OK, OK, I didn't like her that much.</p>


<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Well it sounds like you were really her 'frenemy'&#151;someone who pretends to be her friend but is really her enemy. It's a combination of two words&#151;friend and enemy. Get it?</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Yes, a fren-emy! Hmm, I've never had one of those before.</p>


<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Really? Well let's hear this word in action&hellip;</p>


<p><strong>Examples<br /></strong>She seems so false, I wouldn't trust her&#151;she's just a frenemy.</p>

<p>Tania's been my frenemy for years&#151;I'd go for a quick drink with her but that's it!</p>

<p>Tom's just my frenemy&#151;I pretend to like him but really I can't stand him!</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>If you pretend to be friends with someone but in reality you don't like each other then they are your 'frenemy'. I wonder if I was <em>her</em> frenemy?</p>


<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>I'm afraid you were. She told me she was only friends with you so she could share your biscuits&#151;and she didn't really like you. She told me at the party last night.</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Thank goodness we're real friends Neil&#151;at least we can be honest with each other.</p>


<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Well actually, I don't like you much either. I only pretend to be your friend when I'm presenting this programme!</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Oh no! Now I've got two frenemies!</p>


<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Oh don't cry Feifei. I was only joking.</p>
