<p class="storyTitle">Cost an arm and a leg</p>
<p>(Rob and Vera go shopping)
<table border="0">
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Ah Vera, it's great that you've come with me during our lunch break to do some shopping. I need to buy a suit to go to a wedding and I have to look very smart.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Vera:</td><td> And I will make sure of that, Rob. Everybody says I have good taste. I've always chosen my husband's and my son's pyjamas and they look good while they sleep! Rob, I love that grey suit in the window!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Wow! It looks really smart, actually. It will make me look great!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Vera:</td><td> Exactly! Let's go into the shop, you must try it!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Salesman:</td><td> The colour suits you, Sir! I will see if I can find a smaller size so that it fits you perfectly.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Vera:</td><td> You see, Rob&#160;... This salesman knows what he is talking about. He thinks it looks good on you. But he is right&#151;a size smaller would fit better. And everybody in the wedding will think you are a powerful man.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Yes. Wait Vera, this suit is not for me. I'm reading this label and it says it costs an arm and a leg!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Vera:</td><td> An arm and a leg!? This is terrible, Rob! It's barbaric! This is the 21st century, not the Middle Ages! And the salesman seems quite civilised. He sounded like a nice man who wouldn't demand your limbs!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Don't worry, Vera. I will keep all of my limbs. In English, when we say something costs an arm and a leg we mean that it is very expensive!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Vera:</td><td> So, it is something people say but it doesn't actually involve arms and legs. That's a relief!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Let's hear some examples while I get back into my old clothes.</td></tr>
</table>
<ul>
	<li><em>"I'd like to travel all over Europe, but the air fare might cost me an arm and a leg."</em></li>
	<li><em>"You have to pay a lot of money to give your children a good education nowadays! A place in a top university costs an arm and a leg."</em></li>
</ul>
<table border="0">
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> So, what expression do you use when you want to say that something is very, very expensive?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Vera:</td><td> You might say it costs an arm and a leg.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Yes. Now let's leave this expensive suit here and get out of the shop before that posh-sounding salesman comes back.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Vera:</td><td> Good idea. He will look down on us, Rob. But I would&#160;... pay a nail and an elbow for that scarf there&#160;... and that red dress over there, it might cost a foot and a knee&#160;... Oh, look at that handbag! It's a designer one and must cost an ear and a hand&#160;...&#160;</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> What are you talking about, Vera!? We only say "an arm and a leg"! Now, quickly, let's get out of here!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Vera:</td><td> OK, OK. Bye&#160;...&#160;</p><p></td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Bye.</td></tr>
