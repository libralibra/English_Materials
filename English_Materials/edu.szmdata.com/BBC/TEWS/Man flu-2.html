	<tr><td class="roles">Jen:</td><td>I thought that Neil was supposed to be joining me today&#151;where is he?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Oh Jen, haven't you heard? He's very, very sick. I heard the boss saying he has man flu!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Jen:</td><td> Man flu! That's probably correct.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Is man flu very contagious? Perhaps we had better clean all of our desks in case we get infected too?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Jen:</td><td>No, I think we'll be OK, Li.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> No&#160;... I think that we should all go to the doctor's to see if we can get an immunisation.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Jen:</td><td> I really wouldn't worry too much about it.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> But Jen, you should take it more seriously! <em>All</em>types of flu are very bad&#151;it can leave you very sick for many weeks!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Jen:</td><td>Well, proper flu can, yes. Flu is short for influenza, which is a very infectious virus. It can cause fever, headaches, coughing&#160;... And some strains, or types of flu, can cause death!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Death! Oh, I don't want Neil to die. Should we send him some flowers?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Jen:</td><td> Hold on a second. Neil won't die. Man flu is a bit different to normal flu. In fact, it's not even a real virus.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td>So what is man flu, then?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Jen:</td><td>In English, when a man gets a minor cold or perhaps a sore throat, many women refer to it as man flu.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Why?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Jen:</td><td> Well, lots of men tend to exaggerate their symptoms when they have a minor illness; in other words, they make it sound worse than it actually is.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> I see! So when the boss said that Neil had man flu, she meant that he had a small cold, but is exaggerating his symptoms.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Jen:</td><td> That's right!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Well, I want to talk to him. I'm going to phone him right now and get him to come into work.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Jen:</td><td> Oh dear&#160;...&#160;</td></tr>
	<tr><td/><td class="examples">Phone rings</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Hello Neil, yes, I've heard you're very sick&#160;... Yes, yes, that's terrible. I just wanted to let you know that we're having a party in the office tonight, and I'm going to bring lots of lovely food and cakes for everyone. It's a shame you can't make it because you're too sick&#160;... Oh, oh really? OK then!</td></tr>
	<tr><td/><td class="examples">Li puts phone down</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> He's coming into work now.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Jen:</td><td> Why did you tell him we're having a party?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> I thought if I told him there was going to be food and cakes that he might decide to come into work, after all!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Jen:</td><td> Wow, Li, I think you've just found a cure for man flu&#151;cake!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Just call me Doctor Li!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Jen:</td><td> Join us again for another edition of The English We Speak from bbclearningenglish.com. Bye for now!</td></tr>
