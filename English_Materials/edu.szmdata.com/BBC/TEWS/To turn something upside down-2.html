<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>Helen has lost her precious earring. In a panic, she's searching everywhere for it. Neil is worried about the mess she's creating and tries to help.</p>


<p><strong>Neil</strong>
<br />Hello, welcome to another edition of The English We Speak. I'm Neil.</p>


<p><strong>Helen</strong>
<br />Hi, everyone. I'm Helen.</p>


<p><strong>Neil</strong>
<br />Helen, what are you doing Helen? Are you looking for something?</p>


<p><strong>Helen</strong>
<br />Yes, I am. I'm looking for my earring; it's a present from my mum.</p>


<p><strong>Neil</strong>
<br />Oh. When did you last see it?</p>


<p><strong>Helen</strong>
<br />A minute ago. I looked in the mirror before I came in to the studio. I'm sure I was wearing it.</p>


<p><strong>Neil</strong>
<br />Em, I'll help you look under the table for it. But I don't think you'll find it by turning the place upside down. Be calm. Let's leave the chairs on the floor.</p>


<p><strong>Helen</strong>
<br />I'm not turning the chairs upside down, they are too heavy. I just want to check underneath them.</p>


<p><strong>Neil</strong>
<br />When I say &lsquo;turn the place upside down', what I mean is you are making the studio very messy.</p>


<p><strong>Helen</strong>
<br />I am sorry. Ugh, I found it. It's under the desk.</p>


<p><strong>Neil</strong>
<br />Phew, what a relief. I don't think we'd be allowed back in the studio if we literally turned the studio upside down.</p>


<p><strong>Helen</strong>
<br />So to &lsquo;turn something upside down' means to make the place really messy because you're trying to search thoroughly for something. Here are some examples.</p>


<p><strong>Examples</strong>
<br />I turned my house upside down and I still couldn't find my car keys.</p>

<p>I don't care if you have to turn the place upside down. You've got to find my wedding ring.</p>


<p><strong>Neil</strong>
<br />Well, let's tidy up before the studio managers come back and turn our lives upside down.</p>


<p><strong>Helen</strong>
<br />Let's do that!</p>
