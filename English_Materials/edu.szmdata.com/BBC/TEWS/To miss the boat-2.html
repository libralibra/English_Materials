<table border="0">
	<tr><td class="roles">Finn:</td><td> Come on, Feifei! We are going to be late&#151;this party is my big chance!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> I'm almost ready, Finn! Hi, I'm Feifei. Finn has invited me to his posh uncle's party. He knows lots of celebrities!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Finn:</td><td> Come on! And lots of musicians&#160;... I'm a bit of a rocker myself, and this might just be my chance to meet someone famous&#160;... Come on!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> Coming!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Finn:</td><td> Maybe join the band&#160;... live the rock star life&#160;... oh, this is my one big chance! Come on or I'll miss the boat!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> Boat?! Why didn't you say it before?</td></tr>
	<tr><td/><td class="examples">(Hurried steps, rummaging in a wardrobe and a lifejacket inflating)</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> Here I am.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Finn:</td><td> A lifejacket!?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> Of course! We are going on a boat! I am afraid of water&#151;I can't swim!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Finn:</td><td> Feifei, there's no real boat! In English, when we use the expression 'to miss the boat' we mean that we are too late to take advantage of a good opportunity.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> No boat at all?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Finn:</td><td> Not even a canoe. Listen to these examples.</td></tr>
	<tr><td/><td class="examples">If I hadn't bought a new flat last year I would have missed the boat. Properties are more expensive now.</td></tr>
	<tr><td/><td class="examples">I should have travelled the world when I was young. Now I have a family to take care of. I might have missed the boat.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> Oh, OK, so 'to miss the boat' is to miss an opportunity by being late. It makes sense.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Finn:</td><td> Yes, but we're not going to make it on time now, unless&#160;... we take my uncle's helicopter! It's parked in a field nearby. Come on!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> Helicopter! Wait a minute, Finn.</p><p>(Hurried steps, rummaging in the wardrobe again)</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> Now I am really ready.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Finn:</td><td> Feifei, is it what I think it is? A parachute?!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> Well of course it is! I can't swim and I can't fly either. And I'm afraid of heights!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Finn:</td><td> OK, don't you worry. Let's just go to the party. We don't want to miss the boat, do we?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> We don't want to miss the boat or the helicopter. Bye.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Finn:</td><td> Bye.</p><p>(Helicopter taking off)</td></tr>
