	<tr><td class="roles">Jennifer:</td><td> Hi, and welcome to The English We Speak. I'm Jennifer and with me today is Feifei.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> Hi there.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Jennifer:</td><td> Why do you have that big bag with you?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> Oh this? I'm going to the gym after work.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Jennifer:</td><td> Again? But you went yesterday, and the day before that!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> I need to push myself! I want to get fit.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Jennifer:</td><td> You're such a fitness freak.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> Hey, that's not very nice. What do you mean, I'm a 'fitness freak'? You're calling me some kind of strange monster?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Jennifer:</td><td> I'm not calling you a monster, that's not what the word 'freak' means in this context. In English, you can use the word 'freak' with a noun to say that someone is obsessed by something which you think is strange.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> So when you call me a 'fitness freak', you're saying I'm obsessed by sport and fitness?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Jennifer:</td><td> That's right. It's an informal phrase, usually used if the person saying it is not interested in the hobby or action. So someone might be a 'football freak' if they're watching football. My boyfriend is a 'car freak'&#151;he's obsessed with cars and talking about them, but I'm not interested at all, I think it's weird.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> I understand. Well you might call me a fitness freak, because you don't like it. I'd say I'm a fitness fanatic!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Jennifer:</td><td> Well, I have no intention of going to the gym today or any day. I don't like it and the thought of using the equipment really freaks me out.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> Hang on, you've used the word freak again.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Jennifer:</td><td> Yes, in a slightly different way. 'To freak someone out' is a phrasal verb which means to make someone feel strong emotions, like panic or fear. Going to the gym freaks me out; it makes me panic.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> It freaks you out! You need to toughen up. I really do think you should come and join me for a gym session tonight.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Jennifer:</td><td> No way! I'm too scared and too tired. I'd rather lie on the sofa and watch my favourite soap opera.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> Well, I think that people who sit around and watch television every night are very strange&#151;so I guess you're a television freak! Join us again for another edition of The English We Speak from bbclearningenglish.com.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Both:</td><td> Bye!</td></tr>
