<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>What's making Rob so angry? He's been shouting at someone but they're not listening to him. It's time to learn a phrase about the colour of his face.</p>
<h3>Transcript</h3>

<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Hello and welcome to The English We Speak. I'm Feifei and joining me today is Rob&hellip;. Errr Rob, wake up!</p>

<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Oh yeah hi everyone.</p>

<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>What's wrong Rob?</p>

<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>It's the kids. My house is a mess&#151;toys, pencils, paints everywhere&#151;and I've been trying to get them to clear everything up.</p>

<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>And I guess you haven't been successful?</p>

<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>That's right. I shouted at them until I was blue in the face&#151;but the house is still a mess.</p>

<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Rob, you don't look blue to me&#151;just your normal colour.</p>

<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>I know that&#151;what I mean is, I'm wasting my time because it won't happen&#151;whatever I say I won't get the result I want&hellip;</p>

<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>&hellip; which is a tidy house. Hmm, so saying something 'until you're blue in the face' means telling someone something is a waste of time because nothing will happen or change.</p>
<p>Oh dear Rob, it sounds like you have no control over your kids.</p>

<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>You're probably right. But I'm not alone&#151;let's hear some other people who are 'blue in the face'&hellip;</p>

<p><strong>Examples<br /></strong>I've told him to get here on time until I'm blue in the face but still he continues to arrive late.</p>
<p>He told her not to break the speed limit on the motorway until he was blue in the face but she still did it and guess what? She got a speeding ticket!</p>

<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>So saying 'until I'm blue in the face' means even though you keep saying something, nobody will listen to you. I know what that's like Rob.</p>

<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Really?</p>

<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Yes. Every time you make me a coffee I always ask you to put two sugars in it&#151;but you never do!</p>

<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Err, pardon Feifei? Sorry I wasn't listening. I'm so tired.</p>

<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Why are you so tired Rob? All you did was ask the kids to tidy up.</p>

<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Yes but because they didn't listen to me, I had to tidy everything up.</p>

<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Actually I can see that&hellip; you really are blue in the face&#151;look you've got blue paint there&hellip;and there&hellip; and there&hellip;</p>

<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Arghhh! Those damn kids!</p>

<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Calm down Rob. Your face is turning red!</p>

<p><strong>Both<br /></strong>Bye!</p>
