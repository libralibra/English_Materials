	<tr><td class="roles">Chris:</td><td> Hi, I'm Chris, and welcome to The English We Speak. It's a nice day here in London, so I've come outside to meet Helen. Ah, there she is! Helen, how are you?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> I'm&#160;... fine&#160;... thanks.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Chris:</td><td> What are you doing? What are you looking at?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> I'm looking up.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Chris:</td><td> R-Right. But I can't see anything.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> Neither can I.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Chris:</td><td> Have you seen an aeroplane or something?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> Not sure&#160;...&#160;</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Chris:</td><td> Maybe a bird?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> Well, apparently things are looking up.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Chris:</td><td> Things are looking up?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> Yes, Rosie told me that the weather has been sunny for the last three days, so things are looking up. I thought I'd come and see for myself&#160;... But there's not much going on to be honest.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Chris:</td><td> Ah, I think you've misunderstood. Rosie didn't mean there are things up in the sky.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> Really? What do you mean?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Chris:</td><td> It's an expression. You use the phrase 'things are looking up' when you want to suggest that conditions are getting better or more positive.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> Oh, right&#160;...&#160;</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Chris:</td><td> Here are some examples:</td></tr>
	<tr><td/><td class="examples">My wife and I both found great new jobs last month, so things are looking up.</td></tr>
	<tr><td/><td class="examples">Things are finally looking up now that he's recovered from his illness.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> So when Rosie told me that things were looking up, she meant that the weather has been getting better at the moment.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Chris:</td><td> Yes, she's suggesting that it looks like the weather in general is improving. So what do you think? Do you think the weather is getting better?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> So far, yes, yesterday was really hot. I hope it lasts for the weekend&#160;... But if things get worse, would you say, 'things are looking down'?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Chris:</td><td> Not really. Instead, you could say: "It's taken a turn for the worse".</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> It's taken a turn for the worse. That's a useful phrase.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Chris:</td><td> Oh, but hang on&#160;... look at that black cloud in the sky. It looks like it might rain after all. That's typical English weather!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> Oh great. Things really have taken a turn for the worse! Quick, let's get back to the office before it rains.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Chris:</td><td> Let's go! Do join us again for another edition of The English We Speak and visit our website, bbclearningenglish.com. Bye!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> Bye!</td></tr>
