<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>Rob's making some bold claims that Feifei can't taking seriously. Has he really got some good news or is he just telling outrageous lies? Luckily Feifei has a phrase that can describe his actions. Learn all about it in this programme.</p>
<h3><strong>Transcript</strong></h3>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Hello and welcome to The English We Speak. I'm Feifei and joining me today is Rob.</p>

<p><strong>Rob <br /></strong>Hi everyone. Ah Feifei, what a lovely day it is today.</p>

<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>What? It's raining. You seem to be in a good mood.</p>

<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Yes. I've done all my work and the boss has given me the rest of the day off&hellip; so I'm off. Bye.</p>

<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Hold on Rob! Could you at least stay and present this programme?</p>

<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Oh OK then. I suppose there's no rush to go shopping and spend the bonus he's given me is there?</p>

<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Oh come on Rob. This doesn't sound like our boss. You're telling me a barefaced lie.</p>

<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Barefaced? No no, this really is my hairy face&#151;look!</p>

<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>No&#151;the word 'barefaced' can literally mean 'having no beard' but we also use the word to mean 'without any disguise' or 'being deliberately bold and shameless'. So Rob is a 'barefaced liar' because he's obviously telling a lie without any embarrasment. Sorry Rob, I think you're lying but let's hear some more examples of this phrase&hellip;</p>

<p><strong>Examples<br /></strong>The company's claim that profits had jumped by ten per cent was obviously a barefaced lie.</p>
<p>John was at the pub last night bragging about his goal-scoring again&#151;but we all know he's a barefaced liar.</p>

<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Someone being barefaced means doing something without shame, and Rob&#151;you are being a deliberate and outrageous liar aren't you?</p>

<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Oh well, yes, I suppose so&#151;I was doing it to show you how great I am.</p>

<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Well it didn't work&#151;and I'm going to show you my 'bear' face now.</p>
<p>[BEAR ROAR FX]</p>

<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Wow that's a real 'bear' face but at least you haven't got a beard&#151;although if you did have one, maybe you'd look less&hellip; fat?</p>

<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Huh! Barefaced cheek!</p>

<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Time to go I think. Bye.</p>

<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Bye.</p>
