<h3><span><strong>Summary</strong></span></h3>

<p>You may have heard of the word &lsquo;potty', especially if there are babies around. But do you know what makes Neil &lsquo;go potty'? Find out in the programme.</p>
<h3><span><strong>Transcript</strong></span></h3>
<p><span><strong>Helen<br /></strong></span><span>Hello and welcome to The English We Speak. I'm Helen and joining me today is Neil.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Neil <br /></strong></span><span>Hello everyone.
<br /></span></p>

<p><strong><span>Helen
<br /></span></strong><span>Neil, tell me about your first ever job.</span>
<br /><strong><span>
<br />Neil
<br /></span></strong><span>I worked in a supermarket stacking shelves when I was sixteen.
<br /></span><span></span></p>
<p><span><strong>Helen<br /></strong></span><span>How was it?
<br /></span><span></span></p>
<p><span><strong>Neil<br /></strong></span><span>It was quite boring: just moving things from one place to another. But I was very happy when I got my first week's pay.
<br /></span><span></span></p>
<p><span><strong>Helen<br /></strong></span><span>And how long did you stay in your first job?
<br /></span><span></span></p>
<p><span><strong>Neil<br /></strong></span><span>Not very long: about three months during the summer holiday. If I'd stayed there any longer, I would have gone potty.
<br /></span><span><strong>
<br />Helen<br /></strong></span><span>What? Potty? Did you have to get permission to use the toilet?
<br />
<br /></span><strong><span>Neil
<br /></span></strong><span>Oh no, nothing like that. Nobody needed permission to go to the toilet.
<br />
<br /></span><strong><span>Helen
<br /></span></strong><span>Well, you said you would have gone potty. My baby son has to be reminded about his potty every day.
<br /></span><strong><span>
<br />Neil
<br /></span></strong><span>No, they are two very different things. If someone is potty or is going potty, that means they are crazy or going crazy. Here are a few examples:
<br />
<br /></span><strong><span>Examples
<br /></span></strong><span>My boss wants me to work on New Year's day for no extra money. He must be potty.
<br /></span><span>
<br />She's potty to sell off her car so cheaply.
<br />
<br /></span><strong><span>Neil
<br /></span></strong><span>There is another meaning to &lsquo;potty'. If someone is really keen on something we can use the phrase &lsquo;to be potty about something'. For example, I really like Japanese comic books, so I'm potty about them.
<br />
<br /></span><span><strong>Helen<br /></strong></span><span>I see. I'm potty about miniature owls: I've got nearly one hundred of them at home.
<br />
<br /></span><span><strong>Neil<br /></strong></span><span>Well, I am glad we cleared up the meaning of that. It wouldn't do us any good if people heard us arguing over potties.
<br />
<br /></span><span><strong>Helen<br /></strong></span><span>Oh no. They'd think we've gone potty.
<br />
<br /></span><strong><span>Both
<br /></span></strong><span>Bye.</span></p>
