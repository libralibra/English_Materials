	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> Thanks, but do you actually know the way to the airport?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Yes of course, why are you asking?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> It's just we seem to be going round and round this roundabout. Rob, shouldn't you take that turning there?</td></tr>

	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> We aren't getting anywhere! Come on Rob, I'm going to miss my flight.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Well done Feifei, you've just explained today's phrase&#151;'go round in circles'&#151;although it's nothing to do with driving. If you do something for a long time without achieving any results and you always come back to the same problem, then you can describe the situation as 'going round in circles'.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> OK, so it really means you don't make any progress?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Yes that's right. Let's hear some examples while I decide which turning to take:</td></tr>

<ul>
	<li>The politicians talked for hours but they couldn't come to an agreement; they were just going round in circles.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>I've been going round in circles trying to find the right person to talk to about getting a refund on my ticket but with no success. I give up!</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Because we didn't have the data from the survey, we went round in circles discussing the same old problems.</li>
</ul><p>
<br /><strong>Feifei:</strong> So 'going round in circles' means not getting anywhere&#151;and Rob, we're not getting anywhere today&#151;and I need to get to the airport.

	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> Careful!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Now you see, we're not going round in circles. We're going in the right direction&#160;... we're on the right road&#160;... we're making progress.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> At last we're making progress! No more going round in circles.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Oh no&#160;... hold on&#160;...&#160;</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> What is it Rob?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Another roundabout! Which way now?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> Hmm, take my advice: if you don't want to go round in circles, get organised: take the bus!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Sorry Feifei. There's another flight tomorrow.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Both:</td><td> Bye.</td></tr>
