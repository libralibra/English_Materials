	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td>But you kept saying you knew.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Finn:</td><td> I know. Mildred had this ongoing dispute with her neighbour and she went on and on and on about it. It's always "my nasty neighbour blah blah blah blah blah&#160;...&#160;"</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> Yes, I have to agree it's always the same thing.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Finn:</td><td>And in English we use the phrase "blah blah blah" when we want to represent a boring conversation.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> Where does it come from?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Finn:</td><td>Well, according to an article I read the other day, in ancient Greece, the term "bar bar bar" was used to indicate "meaningless noises".</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> Oh yes! It has the same root as the word "barbarian".</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Finn:</td><td> That's right. And that explanation came from Geoff Nunberg, a linguist at the University of California.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td>"Bar bar bar" might have evolved to what we have today&#160;...&#160;</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Finn:</td><td>&#160;...&#160;Blah blah blah. And Americans might say: "yada yada yada", but it conveys the same idea of a repetitive, boring conversation.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> Yada yada yada&#160;...&#160;</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Finn:</td><td> Yes. And from "blah blah blah" we have the related verb "to blabber", which is used informally to mean to talk a lot in an annoying way, and it can be used for people who tend to reveal secrets because they talk too much.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td>Shall we listen to some examples?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Finn:</td><td> Yes. "Blah blah blah" is today's expression in The English We Speak.</td></tr>
