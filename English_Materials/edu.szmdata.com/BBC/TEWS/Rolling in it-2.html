<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>Neil is rolling around on the studio floor in order to teach an expression connected to wealth. Feifei's there to explain why.</p>
<h3>Transcript</h3>


<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Hello and welcome to The English We Speak with me Neil&#160;...&#160;</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>&#160;...&#160;and me, Feifei. In this programme, we've got an expression which means 'to be very rich'.</p>


<p><strong>Neil</strong>
<br /> And, as usual, in order to demonstrate the meaning of something, I'm going to make a fool of myself. Now, Feifei, please describe what I'm doing.</p>


<p><strong>Feifei</strong>
<br /> OK, so now Neil is rolling around on the floor covered in&#160;... money.</p>


<p><strong>Neil</strong>
<br />So, Feifei, how much money does someone need to roll in it?</p>


<p><strong>Feifei</strong>
<br /> Lots!</p>


<p><strong>Neil</strong>
<br /> And so we have an expression in English&#151;'to be rolling in it'. It means to be extremely rich.</p>


<p><strong>Feifei</strong>
<br /> That's right. Imagine a person has so much money they can literally roll around in it and you can understand this expression. Now get up Neil.</p>


<p><strong>Neil</strong>
<br />OK. Let's hear some examples.</p>


<p><strong>Examples<br /></strong>Carlos is always moaning about lack of money but his parents are rolling in it, so he should just ask them for some.</p>

<p>Since tuition fees have been introduced, you need to be rolling in it to afford university.</p>

<p>My neighbours must be rolling in it&#151;they're having a swimming pool and tennis court built in their garden.</p>


<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>So, there we are&#151;we say someone is 'rolling in it' if they're very rich.</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>I'd love to be rolling in it.</p>


<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>OK then&#151;come and join me!</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>No, I mean that I'd like to be rich&#151;but that does look quite fun actually&#160;... woah!</p>
