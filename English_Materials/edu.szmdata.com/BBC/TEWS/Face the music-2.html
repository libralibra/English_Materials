<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>Neil's forgotten to book a band for the recording of a BBC Learning English drama performance. His boss is expecting to be entertained. Now Neil has to face the music. Listen to the programme to find out what it means.</p>
<h3>Transcript</h3>

<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>Hi Neil. How are you? You're looking quite proud of yourself&hellip;</p>

<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Yeah, I'm great thanks. You know, I've managed to finish off my part of the script of our drama&#151;you know the BBC Learning English Christmas drama.</p>

<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>Oh great! And did you remember to book the band for tomorrow's recording? The big boss is coming, you know. He's really looking forward to it?</p>

<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Oh no I forgot! I knew there was something else I was supposed to do! Now I'm really going to have to face the music.</p>

<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>Face the music? How can you face the music if you haven't booked a band?</p>

<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>I thought you knew this expression, Li. To face the music is another way of saying you have to accept the consequence of your mistakes.</p>

<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>Oh I see. The boss was expecting you to do something and you haven't done it. Now you have to face the music&#151;accept the consequences of your mistake.</p>

<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>To face the music is today's expression for The English We Speak. Listen to some examples:</p>

<p><strong>Examples</strong></p>
<p><em>Whoever keeps missing these deadlines will have to face the music.</em></p>
<p><em>After two years of stealing from the family who hired her, the nanny was caught stealing red-handed. Now she has to face the music.</em></p>

<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>So Li, you're quite a good musician, aren't you?</p>

<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>Well, I can play the guitar a bit&hellip;</p>

<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Fantastic! Bring your guitar in tomorrow for the recording. You play the music to stop me facing the music!</p>

<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>Well&hellip; OK, but I'm not very good&hellip;</p>

<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>You will be fantastic I'm sure. Thanks Li!</p>

<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>OK. Bye!</p>
