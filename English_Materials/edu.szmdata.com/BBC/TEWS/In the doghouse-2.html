<p>
<br /><strong>Feifei:</strong> Hi Rob. Nice to see you here in the park with this lovely dog.
	<tr><td/><td class="examples">(Dog barks)</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Hi Feifei. Yes, this is Fido. As they say, dog is a man's best friend and&#160;... he is my best friend. I'm taking him for a walk. But we have to get back home soon.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> Why Rob? I was going to ask if you wanted a coffee&#160;...&#160;</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Thank you, Feifei, but I can't. I love walking Fido and sometimes I forget to look at my watch. I keep coming home late for dinner and the family is annoyed because the food gets cold. I'm in the doghouse at the moment.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> You are in the doghouse?! That's terrible, Rob! How can you say your dog is your best friend if you kick him out of his own house?</td></tr>
	<tr><td/><td class="examples">(Dog barks)</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> No, no, it's not that&#160;...&#160;</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> Now this poor dog will be left out in the cold, in the rain&#160;... Poor Fido! If you are in the doghouse, where does this lovely dog sleep?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Well, Fido sleeps where he always does: in the doghouse. But in English, we can say someone is 'in the doghouse' if they've annoyed another person.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> So your family is annoyed with you because you were inconsiderate to them.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> That's right. 'In the doghouse' is the expression you'll learn in today's The English We Speak. Let's hear some examples.</td></tr>
	<tr><td/><td class="examples">President Bill Clinton said he was "in the doghouse" after the revelations about his affair with Monica Lewinsky. His wife even considered leaving him.</td></tr>
	<tr><td/><td class="examples">My mother is furious with me. I forgot to do my homework again so I'm in the doghouse.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> So if you go home on time for dinner, you won't be in the doghouse anymore.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> That's what I hope.
	<tr><td/><td class="examples">(Cat meows)</td></tr></td></tr>
	<tr><td/><td class="examples">(Dog barks)</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> Then maybe you'd better hold onto the lead and control Fido.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Come on Fido! Quiet. Calm down, boy. Ignore that cat.</td></tr>
	<tr><td/><td class="examples">(Dog growls)</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> Oh, come on, Fido, quiet or you'll be in the doghouse.</td></tr>
	<tr><td/><td class="examples">(Dog barks)</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Come on, Fido! Come on, boy! Who is a good boy? Come on! Get out of here, you cheeky cat!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Bye.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> Bye.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Cat:</td><td> Meow.</td></tr>
