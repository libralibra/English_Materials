	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> Hey Rob, thanks for going shopping with me yesterday. It was fun, wasn't it?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td>Erm, was it? I don't really call shopping 'fun', but if it made you happy then that's OK. Now it's your turn to make me happy! Come on, get your walking boots on.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td><em>(suspicious)</em> Why, what we are going to do?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Go for a hike up that hill over there. You know how I love hiking.</td></tr>

	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> What? I think you'll find both my boots are on the <em>correct</em>feet.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td>No Feifei. I'm not really talking about <em>your</em> boots. When we say 'the boot's on the other foot' it means the situation is now the opposite of what it was.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td>Thanks for clearing that up. Yes, the phrase 'the boot's on the other foot' means the situation is now the opposite of what it was. Or&#151;the situation is reversed. OK Rob, so you mean I am the one who is going to suffer now.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Yes exactly. It's my turn for some fun now. So come on, now you've got your boots on, let's go.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> Hold on, let's hear some examples of this phrase in action first&#160;...&#160;</td></tr>
	<tr><td/><td class="examples">My football team was always top of the Premiership, but since Manchester United signed that new player, the boot's on the other foot now.</td></tr>
	<tr><td/><td class="examples">My brother always had all the luck, but since I won the lottery, the boot is on the other foot now!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> So, when the boot&#151;or shoe&#151;is on the other foot, it means the situation is reversed. Actually Rob, I have to admit I am quite enjoying the walk.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td><em> (surprised)</em>Really?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td>Yes, my walking boots are so comfortable, the sun is shining&#151;it's actually quite fun!</td></tr>

	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> What's up?</p><p></td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Your boots may be comfortable, but mine are&#151;well, actually they're too tight! Ouch. Can we go back now?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> Ha ha&#151;the boot's on other foot again!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td>Will you carry me?</td></tr>
