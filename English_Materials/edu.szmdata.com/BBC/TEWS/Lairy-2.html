	<tr><td class="roles">Neil:</td><td> Actually it was pretty bad. There were all these traders getting drunk and shouting a lot about their cars and expensive clothes and holidays. You know, they were just really lairy.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> They were what?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Neil:</td><td> Lairy.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Lairy. This adjective is used to describe people, usually men, behaving in a loud, excited and slightly aggressive way. So it wasn't much fun?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Neil:</td><td> No, they made it miserable for everyone else in the place, to be honest.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> So the bar was full of drunk and noisy men. They were talking loudly about their expensive things. They sound very lairy. Here's another example of the word.</td></tr>

<br />
<br /><strong>Example</strong>
<br /><em>
<br />A: Shall we go shopping in Kensington on Saturday afternoon?
<br />B: I'd love to but I hate getting the Tube to Kensington on a Saturday. It's always full of lairy Chelsea fans on their way to the football.
<br />A: Yes, you're right. It's really scary when they're so drunk and shouting and singing. How about somewhere else?</em>
<br />
<br /><strong>Neil:</strong> Those women don't want to get the Tube near the Chelsea football ground on a Saturday because the fans travelling to the stadium are often drunk and shouting and singing. They're lairy.
<table border="0">
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Yes, I've been in that situation too. It's not much fun. So, this word 'lairy': is it common?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Neil:</td><td> I'd say it's quite common, but slang. And you wouldn't often write it. But you'll hear British and Australian people using it; especially in the situations we've talked about.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Anything else I need to know?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Neil:</td><td> Yes, you should use the word in combination with 'blokes'. This is British slang meaning 'men'.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Lairy blokes.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Neil:</td><td> That's right. That's all from us, but we'll leave you with the sound of lairy blokes watching football.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Bye!</td></tr>
	<tr><td/><td class="examples">(Angry football crowd)</td></tr>
