	<tr><td class="roles">Neil:</td><td>Hello and welcome to the BBC Learning English kitchen with me, Neil, and my assistant, Feifei.<strong></strong></td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> Yes, welcome to The English We Speak from BBC Learning English. I am very excited today because Neil has asked me to be his assistant in the BBC Learning English kitchen.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Neil:</td><td> That's right. I've started boiling the water in the saucepan and now I'll prepare the ingredients.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> Oh, I'm so excited! I wonder what Neil's going to cook. So what are the ingredients?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Neil:</td><td> There we go.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> Neil, I think you are emptying your bag from the library rather than the supermarket!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Neil:</td><td>No Feifei, this is right. I'm going to cook the books.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td>Cook the books?! Are you crazy?!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Neil:</td><td>Yes, Feifei. I might look happy and full of joy but there's something terrible I have to admit.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td>Oh no. What's that?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Neil:</td><td>Well&#160;... I have serious financial problems. I'm millions of pounds in debt.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td>Oh no! How will cooking the books help?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Neil:</td><td>It's an expression in English. If you 'cook the books', you change the numbers in a company's financial records so you can take some of the money for yourself illegally.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> Neil! That's not like you. Let's hear some more examples of that phrase being used.</td></tr>

<ul>
	<li><em>A: Did you hear Dave the accountant got fired for stealing from the company?!</em></li>
	<li><em>B: Yeah, he'd been cooking the books for years.</em></li>
</ul><p><em></em></p>
<ul>
	<li><em>A: The chief executive of that bank got sent to jail for cooking the books.</em></li>

	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> Hmm, so are you cooking the books so you can pay off your debts?</td></tr>

	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td>I don't think that's a good idea, Neil. Fraud is a serious crime. Oh, but hang on. What's that floating on the top?</td></tr>
