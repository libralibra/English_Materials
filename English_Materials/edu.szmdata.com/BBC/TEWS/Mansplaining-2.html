<h3>Transcript</h3>

<p><strong>Neil</strong>
<br /> Hello and welcome to The English We Speak from BBC Learning English, I'm Neil and with me is Feifei.</p>

<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Hello.</p>

<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Now Feifei, if you just put on your headphones you'll be able to hear what I'm saying.</p>

<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Yes, I know that.</p>

<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>And you need to push that thing there&#151;we call it a fader&#151;we push that up and speak into the microphone.</p>

<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Ah, yes Neil I already know that.</p>

<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>You see, Feifei, you have to be careful not to be too close to the microphone when you speak, because the pressure of your breath will create this sound&#151;we call that a 'pop' and the recording will sound bad and our listeners will complain.</p>

<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Neil! I've been working in radio for over 10 years! I know how to use the studio! Stop mansplaining.</p>

<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Feifei, I was only doing it to introduce that word&#151;mansplaining. It's a new word. It's made up of two parts&#151;'man' and 'explaining'. Mansplaining is when a man explains something to a woman as if they are stupid or knows less about a subject simply because she is a woman.</p>

<p><strong>Feifei</strong>
<br /> Here are some examples.</p>

<p><strong>Examples<br /></strong>So there was this guy mansplaining the offside rule to me. I've been playing football since I was 4 years old!</p>
<p>Man: Push your foot down a bit harder on the clutch before you try to change gear. It'll make it much smoother.
<br />Woman: Quit the mansplaining. I'm a taxi driver, OK?</p>

<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Mansplaining. A man's explanation to a woman, which shows he thinks he knows more than her just because he's a man.</p>

<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>And did you know Feifei that it's also a verb&#151;to mansplain? Yes, language changes all the time, Feifei. New words come and old words change meaning. That's something all language learners need to know&hellip;</p>

<p><strong>Feifei</strong>
<br />Neil! Stop! Mansplaining!</p>

<p><strong>Both<br /></strong>Bye!</p>
