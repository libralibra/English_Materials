<h3>Transcript</h3>

<p>Note: This is not a word-for-word transcript.</p>


<p><strong>Feifei</strong>
<br />Hello, this is The English We Speak, with me Feifei&hellip;</p>


<p><strong>Neil</strong>
<br />&hellip; and me Neil. Hello!</p>

<p>(Rob opens the studio door)</p>


<p><strong>Rob</strong>
<br />Hi Neil! Sorry to interrupt. I just want to confirm that you're coming to my party. Are you?</p>


<p><strong>Neil</strong>
<br />Yes, of course. Thanks, Rob. It will be a blast!</p>


<p><strong>Rob</strong>
<br />Cool. It'll be great to have you there! I'll let you get back to your recording. See you!</p>


<p><strong>Neil</strong>
<br />No problem.</p>

<p>(Finn opens the studio door)</p>


<p><strong>Finn</strong>
<br />Hi Neil! Just to tell you my presentation was a success. Your advice made all the difference!</p>


<p><strong>Neil</strong>
<br />Oh that's great news, Finn. Always happy to help.</p>

<p>(Vera opens the studio door)</p>


<p><strong>Vera</strong>
<br />Hi Neil! I just wanted to say thanks for putting me in contact with Brian from the IT department. He sorted out my computer problems.</p>


<p><strong>Neil</strong>
<br />No problem, Vera. Any time you need a good contact, just ask.</p>


<p><strong>Feifei</strong>
<br />Wait a minute! We have a programme to do here!</p>


<p><strong>Neil</strong>
<br />Well, what can I do, I'm a people person! In English, you say someone is a 'people person' when they are good at dealing with other people. They're helpful and have the ability to motivate people. People like me, Feifei.</p>


<p><strong>Feifei</strong>
<br />I know, I know. I appreciate your people skills too. Let's hear some examples of how this expression is used.</p>


<p><strong>Examples</strong>
<br />Callum is a people person. He gets along with everybody and would make a great manager.</p>

<p>You know, you should go to the party even if you don't know anybody there. You're a people person and by the end of the night you'll have made lots of new friends.</p>


<p><strong>Feifei</strong>
<br />So many people outside the studio&hellip; Neil, who are they?</p>


<p><strong>Neil</strong>
<br />Oh, these are colleagues and friends I've helped out a bit recently.</p>


<p><strong>Feifei</strong>
<br />But this is&hellip; it's a crowd!</p>


<p><strong>Neil</strong>
<br />I told you: I'm a people person! Hello everybody! I'll be there in a minute!</p>


<p><strong>Both</strong>
<br />Bye!</p>
