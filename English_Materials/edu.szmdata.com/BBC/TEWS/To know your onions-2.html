<table border="0">
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Hello, I'm Li and welcome to The English We Speak, and today I'm here with Rob. Hi Rob.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Hello Li. Now come on Li, concentrate, I need you to help me finish this quiz in the newspaper. If I get all the questions right, I might win a holiday.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Oh right. I love quizzes, especially if it means you can win a holiday! OK Rob, what's your next question?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Right. It says here, what is the capital city of Chile?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Easy. Santiago.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Good. Next, what is the name of the world's largest ocean?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> The Pacific&#151;of course!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Wow&#151;you're good Li. You really know your onions.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> I know my onions? Err, was there a question about onions?!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> No Li!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Good, because that is one thing I don't know anything about, onions&#151;except that they make me cry.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Don't cry Li. It's a compliment. If someone says you know your onions, it means you are experienced in something or you know a lot about a particular subject. So really, it means you're clever!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Oh really?! But why 'onions'?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> It is a strange term and some people say it comes from a man called S.G. Onions who made fake coins to help teach children about money. If they learnt about money they would know their onions.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> I see. But I suppose now we just use it as a silly expression.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> We do. Like this&#160;...&#160;</td></tr>

<table border="0">
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> So knowing your onions means knowing a lot about something. Well that describes me very well then!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Hmm. Now another way of saying it, is that you really know your stuff.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Stuff. You mean like this&#160;...&#160;</td></tr>
