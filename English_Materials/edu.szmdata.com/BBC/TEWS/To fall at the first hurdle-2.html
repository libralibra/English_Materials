<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>Feifei's hoping to set up her own business making and selling cakes but Rob is doubtful it will be successful. He uses an athletic metaphor that means she will fail at the start. Listen in to find out if the metaphor comes true!</p>
<h3><strong>Transcript</strong></h3>


<p><strong>Feifei</strong>
<br />Hello and welcome to The English We Speak, I'm Feifei&hellip;</p>


<p><strong>Rob</strong>
<br />&hellip; and hello I'm Rob. So what's this I hear about your new business idea Feifei?</p>


<p><strong>Feifei</strong>
<br />Yes, I'm going to make and sell cakes.</p>


<p><strong>Rob</strong>
<br />Hmm, are you sure Feifei?</p>


<p><strong>Feifei</strong>
<br />Yes I'm sure. Look I've already made this batch of muffins.</p>


<p><strong>Rob</strong>
<br />Err, are they supposed to be black? Cooking isn't really your speciality is it?</p>


<p><strong>Feifei</strong>
<br />Cooking isn't my speciality! Rob, just you watch, I'm going to be a millionaire selling my homemade cakes.</p>


<p><strong>Rob</strong>
<br />I'm sorry to say Feifei but I think you're going to fall at the first hurdle.</p>


<p><strong>Feifei</strong>
<br />Don't be stupid Rob, I'm not going to be jumping any hurdles&#151;we're not talking about sport&#151;just cooking.</p>


<p><strong>Rob</strong>
<br />No Feifei&#151;I mean you're going to fail right at the start of what you're trying to do.</p>


<p><strong>Feifei</strong>
<br />Thanks Rob! So you think by cooking these 'black' muffins means I have already failed?</p>


<p><strong>Rob</strong>
<br />Well they are burnt. Let's hear some examples of other people who have fallen at the first hurdle&hellip;.</p>


<p><strong>Examples</strong>
<br />Plans to construct a new motorway will fall at the first hurdle if they can't buy the farmland to build it on.</p>

<p>His dream of marrying Julie fell at the first hurdle when he discovered she was already married.</p>


<p><strong>Feifei</strong>
<br />'To fall at the first hurdle' means to fail near the beginning of something. Ah but Rob, why don't you actually taste one of these muffins before you call me a failure?</p>


<p><strong>Rob</strong>
<br />OK here goes. Mmm, actually, not bad Feifei. They're not burnt&hellip;</p>


<p><strong>Feifei</strong>
<br />&hellip; no, it's actually a layer of crunchy toffee. I can cook Rob!</p>


<p><strong>Rob</strong>
<br />OK, I'm sorry for doubting you&hellip; but you're going to have to sell lots of muffins if you want to be a millionaire.</p>


<p><strong>Feifei</strong>
<br />I know. Perhaps I'll just sell these ones first and see how I get on.</p>


<p><strong>Rob</strong>
<br />Good idea. Just make sure you don't fall at the final hurdle!</p>


<p><strong>Feifei</strong>
<br />You mean fail near the end of what I'm trying to do?</p>


<p><strong>Rob</strong>
<br />Exactly.</p>


<p><strong>Feifei</strong>
<br />I won't&#151;as long as you don't keep eating my cakes. Hands off!</p>


<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Sorry!</p>


<p><strong>Both</strong>
<br />Bye!</p>
