	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> (Shouting) Yes it is! But when something is going with a bang is doesn't always have to involve fireworks. (Fireworks get quieter) That's better. If we say a party or an event is going with a bang, it's an informal way of saying it's going very well&#151;it's a success, it's very exciting.</td></tr>
