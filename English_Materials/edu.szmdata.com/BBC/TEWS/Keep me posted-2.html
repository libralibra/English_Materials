	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> Neil will 'keep me posted'. That doesn't mean he's going to put me in the postbox&#151;even though he's obviously a bit confused about what should or shouldn't go in postboxes! It means he will keep me informed, he will tell me what happens. Listen to some examples:</td></tr>
