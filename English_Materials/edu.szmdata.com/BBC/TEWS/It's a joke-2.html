	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> Hello and welcome to The English We Speak from BBC Learning English, I'm Helen. With me today is quite a frustrated-looking Neil. Neil, what are you doing to that mobile phone?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Neil:</td><td> Argh, I can't get it to make a phone call. It does everything else: it takes photos, it connects to the internet, it even irons my shirts but it won't make a call!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> Your mobile phone irons your shirts?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Neil:</td><td> No, not really, but honestly it does everything apart from the one thing I want it to do&#151;make a phone call. It's a joke!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> A joke? But you're not laughing. It can't be a very funny joke.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Neil:</td><td> Well if you say something is a joke in English it can also mean that it's not very good or not worthy of respect.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> Yes, 'joke' has a second meaning.</p><p>Example:</td></tr>
	<tr><td/><td class="examples">The investigation into police corruption was a complete joke. Everyone knows the officers were taking money but they were let off.</td></tr>
	<tr><td/><td class="examples">The weather forecast was a total joke. It said it would be warm and sunny but it's freezing and raining.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> As you heard there in the example, the person described an investigation into police corruption as a joke. This doesn't mean it was funny. It means it wasn't serious. Also the weather forecast was so bad it was described as a joke.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Neil:</td><td> Notice that you can add words before 'joke' to make the meaning even stronger. It's a complete joke.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> A complete joke.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Neil:</td><td> It's a total joke.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> A total joke.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Neil:</td><td> It's an absolute joke.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> Anyway Neil, why don't you just read the instructions for your new mobile phone? Then you'll probably be able to work out how to make a call.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Neil:</td><td> I looked at the instructions but they're an absolute joke.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> Oh really?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Neil:</td><td> Well for a start they are in about 17 languages apart from English.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> What a joke!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Neil:</td><td> Yeah I know.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> Well we've heard lots of jokes in today's programme but there hasn't been much laughing.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Neil:</td><td> Argh, what a useless piece of&#160;...&#160;</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> Let's hope Neil finally works out how to use his phone.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Neil:</td><td> Argh, this is beyond a joke, it really is&#160;...&#160;</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> Join us again for The English We Speak.</td></tr>
