<table border="0">
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td>Hello, and welcome to The English We Speak. My name is Helen.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td>And I'm Rob.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> I saw you looking for your headphones earlier; did you find them?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td>No, Helen. I looked for them everywhere. Someone must have nicked them.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td>Nicked them? What do you mean?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td>Oh, sorry, what I mean is someone stole my headphones. To nick something means to steal something.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td>That's terrible. But how is it spelt?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td>It's spelt N.I.C.K. nick, to nick something.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td>My son's best friend is called Nick. It's the same spelling, isn't it?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td>It is, but not the same meaning. Here the word 'nick' is a verb and it's British slang too.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td>Let's hear a couple of examples. What items have been stolen?</td></tr>
	<tr>
		<td/>
		<td>
			<table border="0" class="examples">
				<tr><td class="roles">Man:</td><td>Someone nicked my bike this morning.</td></tr>
				<tr><td class="roles">Lady:</td><td>Oh, no. Did you report it to the police?</td></tr>
				<tr><td class="roles">Man:</td><td>Yes, I did.</td></tr>
				<tr><td class="roles">Man&#160;1:</td><td>Where are the chocolate biscuits I was saving? I am sure I saw them yesterday.</td></tr>
				<tr><td class="roles">Man&#160;2:</td><td>Sorry, I don't know. Blame Dave, he's always nicking things.</td></tr>
			</table>
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> So, one of them lost a bike and the other one lost his chocolate biscuits.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td>Unlucky chaps. Maybe the police can help them.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td>Yes. The police can definitely help them by nicking those petty thieves. <strong></strong></td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> That's very confusing. The police can nick too? They can steal?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td>No, no, no, no. The police can't nick things from people. But when they arrest someone, we can say the person is nicked. It means they're arrested by the police.</td></tr>
	<tr>
		<td/>
		<td>
			<table border="0" class="examples">
				<tr><td class="roles">Woman:</td><td>Have you heard from Inspector James?</td></tr>
				<tr><td class="roles">Man:</td><td>No. He's working on a big case. I think they have just nicked the main suspect!</td></tr>
			</table>
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td>So if a criminal is caught by the police, then we can say he's nicked.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td>That's right. Let's go over the two meanings of the verb 'to nick'. First, if something is nicked, it means it's stolen.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td>Like my pen got nicked.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td>Yes, that's right. But if a person gets nicked, we mean he's arrested by the police.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td>A comedian got nicked for throwing a pie at Rupert Murdoch.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Yes, he did. Helen, you've got it. Just remember it's not a formal expression.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> Thank you. I'll keep that in mind. Bye for now.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Bye!</td></tr>
