<h3><strong>Summary</strong></h3>

<p>Helen is looking for an adventure holiday in a faraway country, one thing worries her is the language, how can she learn the basics within a short time? Neil has an idea.</p>
<h3><strong>Transcript</strong></h3>

<p><strong>Neil <br /></strong>Hello and welcome to The English We Speak. I'm Neil.</p>

<p><strong>Helen<br /></strong>Hello everyone. I'm Helen.</p>

<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>I saw you looking at a travel magazine earlier. Are you thinking about a holiday?</p>

<p><strong>Helen<br /></strong>Yes, I have actually booked a holiday in the Amazon rainforest.</p>

<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Really, that sounds amazing. When are you going?</p>

<p><strong>Helen<br /></strong>In a month's time, I'm really looking forward to it. Have you been there?</p>

<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>No to the rainforest, but I've visited Brazil with my friends. It's a beautiful country. Can you speak Portuguese?</p>

<p><strong>Helen<br /></strong>No, not at all. I was hoping English is enough.</p>

<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Erm, if you are visiting the big cities, you can get by with English. But out of the cities, it's good to know a bit of Portuguese and about the local culture.</p>

<p><strong>Helen<br /></strong>Oh dear, I am hopeless with languages. They are so difficult to master and take years to learn. I don't have years. I've got weeks to sort out my adventure.</p>

<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Don't worry, you can go on a crash course.</p>

<p><strong>Helen<br /></strong>What course?</p>

<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>A language crash course! When you are on a crash course, you learn about something in a very short period of time.</p>

<p><strong>Helen<br /></strong>But will it work for me?</p>

<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Well, that depends on your learning ability. I think you'd master the basics without any trouble. Here are a few more examples of crash courses on offer:</p>

<p><strong>Examples<br /></strong>Peter applied to train as a teacher, but he had to complete a compulsory crash course in maths first.</p>
<p>Alison did a crash course in French before her trip to Paris.</p>
<p>I booked Nathan on a video editing crash course, so we've got at least one person who can operate the camera.</p>
<p>Julie took a crash course in cooking to prepare for her wedding.</p>

<p><strong>Helen<br /></strong>Can you recommend a Portuguese crash course for me?</p>

<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Just have a look online, there are loads of them and some of them are free.</p>

<p><strong>Helen<br /></strong>Perfect! Thanks Neil!</p>
