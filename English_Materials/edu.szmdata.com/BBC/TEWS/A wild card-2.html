<p class="storyTitle">A wild card</p>

<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Hello and welcome to The English We Speak. I'm Rob and joining me today is Feifei.</p>

<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Hello everyone. Hey, what about that new guy who's started in the office?</p>

<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Brian?</p>

<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Yes, he's very funny&#151;always telling jokes&#151;and yesterday he started juggling with three oranges&#151;he was very good.</p>

<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Hmm, he might be funny but I haven't seen him do much work&#151;I think he's a bit of a wild card.</p>

<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>A wild card? You mean he's like a playing card&#151;a heart, a spade or maybe a diamond?</p>

<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>No, no, although the expression does come from playing cards&#151;here, it means he is unpredictable: he's someone we don't know much about so we're not sure how he's going to behave in the future.</p>

<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Oh do you think so? Well yes Rob, Brian is unpredictable!</p>

<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Let's hear some more examples of this phrase&hellip;
<br />
<br /><strong>Examples<br /></strong>We're taking a gamble, she's a wild card, but let's hope she delivers what she promises.</p>
<p>Jack is too much of a wild card to get a place on our team.</p>
<p>The wild card in this competition is Chelsea: nobody really knows which way the score will go.</p>


<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Right, have you got that? A wild card can describe someone who is unpredictable or they behave in an unexpected way. But although Brian is a wild card, I wish he'd settle down and do some work instead of joking around all the time.</p>

<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Oh do you wish you were a bit like him?</p>

<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Not at all&#151;anyway what kind of card would you call me?</p>

<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>You're my favourite card&#151;you're an ace!</p>

<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Ace! Gosh thanks Feifei, you're such a card!</p>

<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>See you next time.</p>


<p><strong>Both<br /></strong>Bye!</p>
