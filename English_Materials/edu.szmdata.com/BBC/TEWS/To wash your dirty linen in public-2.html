<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>Are Rob's neighbours discussing personal issues in the garden where everyone can hear? Luckily Feifei is about to help clear up some confusion about a phrase that describes what they're allegedly doing.</p>
<h3>Transcript</h3>


<p><strong><span>Feifei
<br /></span><span></span></strong><span>Hello and welcome to The English We Speak with me Feifei&hellip;</span></p>


<p><strong><span>Rob
<br /></span></strong><span>&hellip;and me, Rob. Hello!</span><span>Hey Feifei, you know that expression 'to wash your dirty linen in public'?</span></p>


<p><strong><span>Feifei
<br /></span></strong>Yes. The expression 'to wash your dirty linen in public' describes someone who talks about private matters in public&#151;so everyone can hear them. You wouldn't catch me doing that!</p>


<p><strong><span>Rob</span></strong>
<br /><span> Nor me&#151;I always keep private matters private&#151;but anyway it's exactly what Daisy and Tom have been doing.</span></p>


<p><strong><span>Feifei</span></strong>
<br /><span> What? They've been washing their dirty linen in public&#151;you mean they've been arguing?</span></p>


<p><strong><span>Rob</span></strong>
<br /><span> Not exactly&#151;but yesterday, they were out in the garden making lots of noise.</span><span></span></p>


<p><strong><span>Feifei</span></strong>
<br /><span> Oh I see. Actually Rob I think&hellip;</span></p>


<p><strong><span>Rob</span></strong>
<br /><span> &hellip;and I'm sure Daisy said something about hanging Tom out to dry.</span><span></span></p>


<p><strong><span>Feifei</span></strong>
<br /><span> Rob, Rob. There's a simple explanation. But let's hear some more examples of this phrase first&hellip;</span></p>


<p><strong><span>Examples
<br /></span></strong><span>Tim kept discussing his brother's drinking problem at the pub but I told him not to wash his dirty linen in public.</span></p>

<p><span>I know he's having an affair but do they have to wash their dirty linen in public?</span></p>

<p><span>Don't wash your dirty linen in public, save your argument for when you get home!</span></p>


<p><strong><span>Feifei
<br /></span></strong><span>So the expression 'to wash your dirty linen in public' means you discuss private matters in public. But Rob, I don't think Daisy and Tom were talking about their family problems in the garden.</span></p>


<p><strong><span>Rob
<br /></span></strong><span>Well I could hear what was going on.</span></p>


<p><strong><span>Feifei
<br /></span></strong><span>Are you sure? Because I spoke to Daisy and she said their washing machine had broken down and they were actually washing their clothes outdoors, in the garden. I think the noise was just them having a laugh.</span></p>


<p><strong><span>Rob
<br /></span><span></span></strong><span>But what about Daisy saying she was going to hang Tom out to dry?
<br />
<br /></span><strong><span>Feifei</span></strong>
<br /><span> I think she meant she was going to hang Tom's</span><em><span>clothes</span></em><span> out to dry. You need to</span>mind your own business<span> and then you won't hear people washing their dirty linen in public&#151;either literally or metaphorically!
<br />
<br /></span><strong><span>Rob
<br /></span></strong><span>Thanks for the advice Feifei. Bye.
<br />
<br /></span><strong><span>Feifei</span></strong>
<br /><span> Bye.</span></p>
