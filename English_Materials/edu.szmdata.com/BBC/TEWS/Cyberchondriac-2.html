<h3>Transcript</h3>


<p><strong><span data-mce-mark="1">Feifei
<br /></span></strong>Hello and welcome to The English We Speak with me, Feifei&hellip;</p>


<p><strong>Sian</strong>
<br />&hellip;and me, Sian. Hello! Hey Feifei what are you doing on your phone? We've got a programme to record.</p>


<p><strong>Feifei</strong>
<br />Well you see I've got a really bad headache and it says here on this website that I might have a head injury, or maybe a tumour or&hellip;</p>


<p><strong>Sian</strong>
<br />Or maybe you've just got a headache! Give me that phone&hellip; you're just scaring yourself!</p>


<p><strong>Feifei</strong>
<br />Hang on it says here that I should go to the hospital if I have these other symptoms. Maybe I do have a fever&hellip; I am feeling quite hot.</p>


<p><strong>Sian</strong>
<br />That's because it's boiling in here&#151;I'm hot too&hellip; and I'm starting to get a headache. I know exactly what's wrong with you&#151;you have a case of cyberchondria!</p>


<p><strong>Feifei</strong>
<br />Cyberchondria? Oh dear I knew something was wrong. That sounds serious&#151;what is it?</p>


<p><strong>Sian</strong>
<br />A cyberchondriac is someone who looks up medical advice on the internet for every symptom they have and then gets really anxious because they think they have a serious illness! Just like you're doing.</p>


<p><strong>Feifei</strong>
<br />Oh, like a 'hypochondriac'&#151;that's someone who imagines illnesses that they don't have, isn't it?</p>


<p><strong>Sian</strong>
<br />Exactly, this term is a combination of 'cyber'&#151;relating to computers&#151;and hypochondriac. Let's hear some examples&#160;...&#160;
<br />
<br /><strong>Examples</strong>
<br />There are so many medical websites nowadays, it's no wonder more and more people are self-diagnosing and becoming cyberchondriacs.</p>

<p>Ana: I was convinced that I had this really rare disease that I read about online. Turns out I just wasn't drinking enough water!</p>

<p>Joe: Ha! You're such a cyberchondriac!</p>


<p><strong>Feifei</strong>
<br />Right, let's get on with the programme&#151;I haven't brought my glasses today so I'm afraid I can't read the script very well.</p>


<p><strong>Sian</strong>
<br />What? You've forgotten your glasses? Well no wonder you've got a headache.</p>


<p><strong>Feifei</strong>
<br />Oh yeah that could be it. Phew I was convinced something terrible was wrong with me. Right, let's get on with the programme.</p>


<p><strong>Sian</strong>
<br />Hang on there's a link here to the 'ten most dangerous tropical diseases' I'll just have a quick look&hellip;.</p>


<p><strong>Feifei</strong>
<br />But you haven't even been to a tropical country lately. Put the phone down!</p>


<p><strong>Sian<br /></strong>Alright! See you later. Bye!</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Bye!</p>
