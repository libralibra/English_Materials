<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>Neil's brought a goat into the studio to help teach an English expression. This has really annoyed Feifei.</p>
<h3>Transcript</h3>


<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Hello and welcome to The English We Speak, I'm Neil and joining me is Feifei&hellip; and Fred&#160;... my goat.</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Hi everyone. Neil, why have you brought this&hellip; goat into the studio? It smells.</p>


<p><strong>Neil</strong>
<br /> Fred doesn't smell! I've brought my goat into the studio to teach our listeners an expression you can use when something annoys you.</p>


<p><strong>Feifei</strong>
<br /> Well, having smelly animals in the studio annoys me.</p>


<p><strong>Neil</strong>
<br /> Well, in that case, Feifei, you can say, 'Smelly animals in the studio get my goat.'</p>


<p><strong>Feifei</strong>
<br /> To get somebody's goat&#151;an expression you can use when something annoys you.</p>


<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>That's right. You can say something 'gets your goat' if it annoys you. You know what, Feifei? It gets my goat when people say my pet Fred is smelly.</p>


<p><strong>Feifei</strong>
<br /> Ha! Here are some examples of people using the expression 'get somebody's goat'.</p>


<p><strong>Examples<br /></strong>These queues at the post office really get my goat. I've been waiting for half an hour!</p>

<p>Argh, I don't believe it&#151;I've got a parking ticket! Traffic wardens really get my goat!</p>

<p>These calls from people selling insurance get my goat. They've rung seven times already this morning.</p>


<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>To get somebody's goat&#151;an expression you can use when something annoys you.</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Notice that we often use 'really' with this expression. Train delays <em>really</em> get my goat.</p>


<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>It seems to me quite a lot of things get your goat, Feifei.</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Not really, Neil&#151;apart from Fred.</p>


<p><strong>Neil</strong>
<br /> Are you saying my goat gets your goat?</p>


<p><strong>Feifei</strong>
<br /> Yes! Your goat <em>really</em> gets my goat!</p>
