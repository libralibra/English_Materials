<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>Feifei is worried&#151;Rob went for an interview and got a slap in the face. Is he OK? Luckily it's just another English expression he's using and the only thing that's hurt is his pride!</p>
<h3>Transcript</h3>

<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Welcome to The English We Speak with me, Rob.</p>

<p><strong>Feifei</strong>
<br /> And me Feifei. Hello! So how did your interview go?</p>

<p><strong>Rob</strong>
<br /> You know, quite good&hellip; ok&hellip; well not bad.</p>

<p><strong>Feifei</strong>
<br /> So did you get the promotion?</p>

<p><strong>Rob</strong>
<br /> Well&hellip; no. I didn't&hellip; it was a bit of a slap in the face actually.</p>

<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>A slap in the face? Did they hit you?!</p>

<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>No, no, no. I mean not getting the job is a bit of an insult&#151;I was the right man for the job&#151;look at all my qualifications and experience.</p>

<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Oh dear. You sound quite offended Rob.</p>

<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>That's what 'a slap in the face' means&#151;it's an action that can be seen as an insult or cause offence. It can also cause disappointment because you were expecting a more positive outcome.</p>

<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Like getting that promotion?</p>

<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Exactly. Here are some more examples&hellip;</p>

<p><strong>Examples<br /></strong>After all the extra work we put in, it was a slap in the face not to win the contract.
<br />Not being invited on his stag do, was a real slap in the face&#151;I thought I was his best friend!</p>

<p><strong>Feifei</strong>
<br /> So 'a slap in the face' is an insult&#151;or an action that causes offence or disappointment. It's not actually a physical slap in the face then?</p>

<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>That's right.</p>

<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>So what are you going to do about getting a promotion?</p>

<p><strong>Rob</strong>
<br /> Well to be honest, Feifei, it wasn't much of a promotion anyway&#151;it was quite a boring job role and no more money&#151;an idiot could have done it&#151;I think you would have been good at it&hellip;</p>
<p>[SLAP]</p>
<p>&hellip;ow, what was that?</p>

<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>That's a real slap in the face!</p>

<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Was it something I said?</p>
