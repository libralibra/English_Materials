	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Hello. I'm Rob. And this is Li!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Hello.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> The weather is so great today we're outside on the sea, sailing in this beautiful boat. What do you think Li?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Impressive. Rob, I didn't know you had a sailing boat&#151;in fact I didn't know you could sail a boat!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Don't worry Li, I know what I'm doing.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Mind that rock!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Whoa&#160;... it's ok Li. Iâ€™m in control&#151;just keep your hand on that rope. We've got the wind in our sails, the sea is calm&#151;we can just easily sail around this island and be home in time for tea.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Oh right. I thought our excursion was going to be trouble free&#151;or plain sailing.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> What? Plain sailing? We're not sailing any planes Li.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> No Rob. Plain sailing. It's an expression used to describe an activity that goes well or smoothly and is easy and uncomplicated.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Yes of course&#151;this sailing is going well and is actually quite easy&#151;so you're right&#151;this is plain sailing. But can we only use the phrase to describe sailing boats?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> No. Although it was originally a sailing term, it can really refer to any activity. Listen to these examples:</td></tr>
	<tr><td/><td class="examples">Driving through the city was difficult but once we were on the motorway it was plain sailing all the way.</td></tr>
	<tr><td/><td class="examples">Once we found some office space and recruited staff, setting up our business was plain sailing.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> So plain sailing means things are going well. I have to admit Rob, your sailing skills are very good and&#160;... oh watch out for that big wave!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Whoa&#160;... ouch! I've hit my head on the boom. Oh no, we're heading for the rocks again&#160;... hold the rope Li, quick!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> I've changed my mind Rob, this isn't plain sailing anymore! That's taken the wind out of your sails Rob.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Err, it's still windy Li. Look at the sails.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> No Rob. That's another sailing idiom&#151;to take the wind out of your sails is an expression that means your boasting and arrogance has been challenged. Let's hear some other people using this expression:</td></tr>
	<tr><td/><td class="examples">I was all ready for a big argument but when he bought me some flowers it took the wind out of my sails.</td></tr>
	<tr><td/><td class="examples">The negative feedback from my boss has really taken the wind out of my sails.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Hmm, Li you've certainly taught me a lot about sailing today&#151;there are some really good expressions&#151;but one thing you haven't taught me is how to sail this boat.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> You said you knew how to sail it.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Well when I said I had been sailing several times I had&#160;... but I meant on a ferry&#160;... as a passenger.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Oh. Watch out!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> That was close. I've a feeling this really isn't going to be plain sailing after all.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Too right! Bye bye.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Bye. Now Li could you just hold that rope there please.</td></tr>
