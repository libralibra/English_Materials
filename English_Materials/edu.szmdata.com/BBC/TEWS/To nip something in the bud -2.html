<table border="0">
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> Hello and welcome to The English We Speak. I'm Helen.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">William:</td><td> Hi, I'm William. Today Hampton Court Palace Flower Show is opening.</td></tr>
	<tr><td/><td class="examples">Music, birdsong</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> Oh, Hampton Court Palace Flower Show&#151;the world's largest flower show! I've seen it on the news before. If only I had a garden!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">William:</td><td> Ah yes, you live in an apartment, don't you Helen?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> Yeah. So William, let me guess, today we are going to do a phrase relating to flowers and gardening?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">William:</td><td> Exactly.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> So&#160;...&#160;? What's the phrase?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">William:</td><td> Er&#160;... Well, how about&#160;... how about&#160;... er. No, it's gone. It's no good. I can't think of a phrase right now.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> Oh well. Let's just have a chat instead. I'm tired of learning new phrases anyway.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">William:</td><td> OK. Well, how are you Helen? How are the kids?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> Oh they are both really well. My little boy eats too much chocolate though!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">William:</td><td> Oh really? Well, you want to nip that in the bud.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> Eh? Nip it in the bud?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">William:</td><td> Nip it in the bud. If you nip something in the bud, you stop it <span>before</span> it becomes a problem. Listen to this example from a business context:</td></tr>
	<tr>
		<td/>
		<td>
			<table border="0" class="examples">
				<tr><td class="roles">Man:</td><td>The last few deliveries we've had from this company have all had broken parts in them.</td></tr>
				<tr><td class="roles">Woman:</td><td>Well, we need to nip that in the bud. Tell them that unless their service improves, we're going to look for another supplier.</td></tr>
			</table>
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> So in that example, the man was complaining about poor service from a supplier. The woman wanted to nip it in the bud.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">William:</td><td> That's right. She wanted to take steps to improve the service before it got even worse.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td>So where does this phrase come from William&#151;to nip something in the bud?</td></tr>
	<tr><td/><td class="examples">Birdsong and music</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">William:</td><td> Well, it comes from gardening, actually. A bud is the part of a plant that becomes a flower, a leaf or stem. If you nip something in the bud, you cut the bud off the plant before it has time to grow.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> Oh. That's not very nice.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">William:</td><td> Well, gardening is a tough game, Helen. You have to nip things in the bud sometimes. You also have to kill slugs and snails.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> Eugh! I'm glad I don't have a garden.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">William:</td><td> Bye!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> Bye!</td></tr>
