<br />
<br />(Sound of dreamy music)</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Neil:</td><td> We were lucky to find these cheap tickets and fly here to the United States, weren't we? This is a wonderful place, Li.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Yes, this is a wonderful place!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Neil:</td><td>&#160;...&#160;where we found a boat and decided to sail on this river! Blue sky, blue water&#160;... Don't you feel at one with nature, Li?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Of course, yes, I do feel in harmony with nature. But we've been sailing for a while now and I'm not sure where we are&#160;... Where are we, Neil?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Neil:</td><td> I'm not sure either. What I can say is that&#160;... this boat is rocking a lot, isn't it?&#160;...&#160;</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Yes, but it must be normal.</td></tr>

	<tr><td class="roles">Neil:</td><td> No, there's no water in the boat. Having a sinking feeling is what you say in English when you realise something bad is happening or about to happen.</td></tr>

<br />Man 2: Oh the main player in the team has just got a red card! I've a sinking feeling that my team is going to lose this match!</em>
<br /><strong>
<br />Li:</strong> So, what is this sinking feeling that you have, Neil? If it's not the boat, what is it?
<table border="0">
	<tr><td class="roles">Neil:</td><td> Well, while we were admiring the view a few minutes ago I saw a sign over there on the bank of the river that said: Niagara Falls. I've heard this name somewhere and I don't think it's good. I don't remember why but&#160;...&#160;</td></tr>
