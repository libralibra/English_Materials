	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Ha ha, yes! I am! A happy bunny, which literally means a happy rabbit. It's another of those strange English expressions. What Neil actually means is that I look happy. Why rabbits are involved I don't know, that's just the way it is. Here are some examples of this expression in use.
