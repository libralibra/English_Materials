	<tr><td class="roles">Abigail:</td><td> Hello, I'm Abigail and I'm with Rob and we're doing some shoe shopping.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Yes I'm looking for some new trainers.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Abigail:</td><td> Well, we're not really supposed to be looking for your trainers, Rob. We're here because we have an amusing phrase which our listeners might like to learn.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Oh well, I know that, but while we're here, I can look at trainers.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Abigail:</td><td> Well, I suppose you can look at some trainers. But let's not forget why we're here.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td>&#160;...&#160;(long pause)</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Abigail:</td><td> Rob? Why we're here?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Oh, yes of course&#151;look that lady has really funny hair!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Abigail:</td><td> Rob, you're being very childish today. But that's useful because I can use our phrase for today&#151;act your age not your shoe size.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> 'Act your age, not your shoe size' it's a good phrase. How shall we explain it?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Abigail:</td><td> I think you have explained it beautifully already, through everything you've said and done Rob. But here are some more clues to what it means:</td></tr>
</table>
<ul>
	<li><em>I was really upset. She just told me to act my age not my shoe size!</em></li>
	<li><em>These people are so childish. They need to act their age not their shoe size.</em></li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><em>(Laughing in background)
<br />Will you please act your age not your shoe size?!</em></li>
</ul>
<table border="0">
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> If someone thinks you're being childish, immature, too young for your age, they can tell you to act your age, not your shoe size.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Abigail:</td><td> Mmm, yes they can.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> But look at these trainers here&#151;it says size 44. My age is 30. So I have to act younger?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Abigail:</td><td> Ah&#151;yes well, 44&#151;that's a European size. This saying, 'act your age not your shoe size', only works for British and American sizes. So, for example in UK sizes, your feet are size 10.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> I see. So I shouldn't act like I'm ten.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Abigail:</td><td> Exactly.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Maybe to be accurate we should change the phrase to 'act your European shoe size, not your British shoe size'.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Abigail:</td><td> Hmm. Well, we could. It's not quite as catchy&#160;...&#160;</td></tr>
