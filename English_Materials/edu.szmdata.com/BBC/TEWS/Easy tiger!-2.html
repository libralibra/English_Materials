	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Whoa!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> I don't want to talk about it.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> About what? The fact you dyed your hair?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> Enough!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Whoa! Easy tiger!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> I do not look like a tiger!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> I never said you did. It's just an expression. Though come to think of it, your hair is kind of stripy orange now.</p><p>(Helen starts sobbing)</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> OK, you really don't look like a tiger though. I said "easy tiger!" which is just a way of saying "calm down".</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> It's all the hairdresser's fault. He told me I would look beautiful with copper highlights, then he did this to me. Now I have orange stripes, I look like a jungle animal.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> No, you don't look like a jungle animal. Listen to me. We say "easy tiger" when we want someone to calm down, to not get over-emotional, or not to rush into something.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> Oh. You're talking about tigers because of the way I'm behaving, not because of my hair?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> That's right. It's an expression that's usually used in informal situations, between friends. Here are some more examples.</td></tr>
	<tr>
		<td/>
		<td>
			<table border="0" class="examples">
				<tr><td class="roles">Girl&#160;1:</td><td>I've just met the perfect man&#151;he is tall, handsome, kind&#160;... I'm going to marry him and have children&#151;we'll live together in a house by the sea, we'll -</td></tr>

	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> I understand. Maybe my hair is not so bad after all.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> No, it's just unusual. It doesn't make you look like a tiger&#160;... I'd say more of an orangutan than a tiger&#160;...&#160;</td></tr>
