<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>Feifei and Finn are going to present a programme&#151;but before they begin, Feifei wants Finn to pass her the&hellip; thingy. What does she mean? Listen to the programme to find out.</p>
<h3>Transcript</h3>

<p>Note: This is not a word-for-word transcript.</p>
<p><span><strong>Feifei<br /></strong></span><span>Hello Finn. Looking forward to another The English We Speak?</span></p>

<p><strong><span>Finn
<br /></span></strong><span>Hi, Feifei! Oh yes, always&hellip;</span></p>

<p><strong><span>Feifei
<br /></span></strong><span>Actually, before we begin, could you pass me the thingy?</span></p>

<p><strong><span>Finn
<br /></span></strong><span>Which thingy? The script?</span></p>

<p><strong><span>Feifei
<br /></span></strong><span>No, no&#151;not the script. The thingy behind you&hellip;</span></p>

<p><strong><span>Finn</span></strong>
<br /><span>Ah, you need a pen? Here you go.</span></p>

<p><strong><span>Feifei
<br /></span></strong><span>No. I've got a pen actually. Two pens. I mean that&hellip; thingy over there&hellip;</span></p>

<p><strong><span>Finn</span></strong>
<br /><span>Which thingy? Listen, I know this studio is a bit of a mess, isn't it? So if you keep saying 'thingy' we could be here all day!</span></p>

<p><strong><span>Feifei
<br /></span></strong><span>Sorry, Finn. 'Thingy' is a word which we sometimes use when I can't remember or don't know the name of an object.</span></p>

<p><strong><span>Finn</span></strong>
<br /><span>It is indeed. And it can be used, informally, when you can't remember the name of a particular person too. And it's today's expression, Feifei?</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Feifei<br /></strong></span><span>Yes, why not? 'Thingy' is our word today in The English We Speak. Let's hear some examples of how it's used.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Examples<br /></strong></span><span>You want a recipe for stew? Ask&hellip; thingy. She was talking about a lovely one the other day.</span></p>

<p>Sorry, I'm late for the meeting. Could you just pass me the thingy for my report&hellip; I mean&hellip; the stapler?</p>
<p><span><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>That's it! I was asking for the&hellip; stopwatch! I need to time the programme, Finn.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Finn<br /></strong></span><span>No, you don't. The programme is over. And this stopwatch shouldn't really be here. It belongs to&hellip; to&hellip; he was looking for it the other day.
<br /></span><span><strong>
<br />Feifei<br /></strong></span><span>Belongs to&hellip;?</span></p>

<p><strong><span>Finn
<br /></span></strong><span>It belongs to&hellip; thingy.</span></p>

<p><strong><span>Feifei
<br /></span></strong><span>Come one, Finn. It belongs to Rob. I'll return it to him!</span></p>

<p><strong><span>Both
<br /></span></strong><span>Bye!</span></p>
