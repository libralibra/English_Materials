	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> Actually, you don't have a six-pack. You have a beer belly!</td></tr>

	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> And now, as a slang expression, it can also describe the shape of stomach muscles&#160;... on people who are very fit you can see six round muscles&#151;which looks like a six pack of drink. Unfortunately, not on you Finn.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Finn:</td><td> What are you saying?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> Anyone can see you don't have a six-pack. You have a one-pack&#151;one huge beer belly!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Finn:</td><td> Well, I think that phrase is easy enough to understand.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> Too many six-packs of beer, I'm afraid!</td></tr>

<table border="0">
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> So Finn, how about you leave that six-pack of beer and swap it for&#160;... a healthy fruit smoothie!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Finn:</td><td> Nice idea, and I can see a fruit smoothie seller over there! I'll go and buy two. See you in a bit.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> Thanks Finn. While he's over there let me remind everyone if you want to learn more phrases like six-pack and beer belly, check out bbclearningenglish.com. And do some exercise! Bye.</td></tr>
