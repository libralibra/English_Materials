<h3><strong>Transcript</strong></h3>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Hi everyone, I'm Feifei, and this is The English We Speak and with me is&hellip; is&hellip; Rob.
<br />Are you ok Rob?</p>


<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>No&hellip; I haven't finished writing the script for this programme&#151;I still don't know how it's going to end.</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>So what! Rob, it's not important.</p>


<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>What?! A script is not important&#151;how am I going to make this programme word-perfect, without any mistakes? What will the audience think of me?</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>At the moment, they probably think you are a little crazy&#151;you're over-reacting Rob&#151;you're making a mountain out of a molehill.</p>


<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Making a mountain out of a molehill! I won't be making any mountains, I haven't got time.</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>No Rob&#151;it's just a saying! The phrase 'to make a mountain out of molehill' means you're making a big issue out of a small issue. You are over-reacting! So calm down Rob&#151;it's not a big issue not having a script, is it?</p>


<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>[silence]</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Rob?</p>


<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>I don't know what to say&#151;it's not on the script!</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Oh dear&#151;we'd better hear some other examples of this phrase&hellip;</p>


<p><strong>Examples<br /></strong>I only asked him to do the shopping and now he's going on about how he has no time to go to the pub&#151;he's making a mountain out of a molehill.</p>

<p>It's only a 2000-word essay&#151;stop making a mountain out of a molehill!</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>So&#151;making a mountain out of a molehill means making a small problem seem like a big one. And Rob, not finishing a script for this programme is a <em>small</em> problem.</p>


<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>If you say so Feifei.</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Just do what we always do&#151;make it up!</p>


<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>OK, I'll try&#151;hold on, what's that?</p>

<p>[DIGGING/SQUEAKING FX]</p>

<p>Look! A real mole has buried into the studio&#151;so now we have a real molehill to make a mountain out of.</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>You would <em>never</em> have written that in a script Rob!</p>


<p><strong>Rob.<br /></strong>True. Bye!</p>

<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Bye!</p>
