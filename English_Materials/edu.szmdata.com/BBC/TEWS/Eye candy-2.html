<p>Note: This is not a word-for-word transcript.</p>
<p><span><strong>Feifei<br /></strong></span><span>Hello. I'm Feifei and with me in the studio is&#160;...&#160;</span></p>

<p><strong><span>Finn
<br /></span></strong><span>Finn, hello!</span></p>

<p><strong><span>Feifei
<br /></span></strong><span>Hey, do you feel a bit tired, Finn? Well, I do. What a party yesterday!</span></p>

<p><strong><span>Finn
<br /></span></strong><span>Yes, it was good, wasn't it? Great food, plenty to drink&hellip;</span></p>

<p><strong><span>Feifei
<br /></span></strong><span>Now&hellip; forgive me for being nosey but&hellip;you said you were too busy working to have a love life. So&hellip; who was that beautiful woman you were with?</span></p>

<p><strong><span>Finn</span></strong>
<br /><span>Ah, that was &hellip; just a girl I know&hellip;</span></p>

<p><strong><span>Feifei
<br /></span></strong><span>Come on, Finn, don't be so mysterious. Everybody was looking at her. She looked like a supermodel! Is it serious? No offence, but how did you manage to attract a woman like that?</span></p>

<p><strong><span>Finn</span></strong>
<br /><span>What do you mean? I'm very handsome! But she's not my girlfriend&hellip;</span></p>

<p><strong><span>Feifei
<br /></span></strong><span>Just some eye candy, then?</span></p>

<p><strong><span>Finn</span></strong>
<br /><span>That's not fair. I mean, yes she's beautiful&#151;but eye candy means someone who is attractive, but not very interesting&hellip;</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Feifei<br /></strong></span><span>I know&#151;just teasing! It sounds like you like her&hellip;</span></p>

<p><strong><span>Finn
<br /></span></strong><span>Err, OK then, I do quite like her&hellip;</span></p>

<p><strong><span>Feifei</span></strong>
<br /><span>Ooh, you admitted it!</span></p>

<p><strong><span>Finn
<br /></span></strong><span>I know&hellip;</span></p>

<p><strong><span>Feifei
<br /></span></strong><span>We can also use eye candy to talk about things which look good but are not very useful. Let's hear some examples.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Examples<br /></strong></span><span>I was going out with this gorgeous footballer but it didn't last. He was just eye candy.</span></p>
<p><span>This illustrated cookbook looks good but you can never find the ingredients for the recipes. These pictures are just eye candy!</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Well, the party was fun anyway. And you know what? Today I'm going on a date with a guy I met there.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Finn<br /></strong></span><span>Mmm&hellip; is this the beginning of a romance, Feifei?</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Feifei<br /></strong></span><span>Oh, no. He's very boring, actually.</span></p>

<p><strong><span>Finn
<br /></span></strong><span>Just some eye candy then?</span></p>

<p><strong><span>Feifei
<br /></span></strong><span>Well&hellip; we'll see. But I want to make all my friends jealous!</span></p>

<p><strong><span>Both
<br /></span></strong><span>Bye!</span></p>
