<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>Rob and Feifei are discussing a new way of working in modern offices. What does the phrase 'hot desk' mean? And why do big organisations choose to hot-desk? Listen to the dialogue.</p>
<h3>Transcript</h3>

<p>Note: This is not a word-for-word transcript.</p>

<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Hello and welcome to The English We Speak. I'm Feifei and with me is Rob.</p>

<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Hello everyone. Hi Feifei, how are you?</p>

<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>I'm very well, Rob, thank you. Which cool phrase have you brought to share with us?</p>

<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>I'd like to introduce the phrase 'to hot-desk' and the idea behind hot-desking in modern offices.</p>

<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>I know this one, Rob. To hot-desk or hot-desking is an increasingly popular way of working to save office space.</p>

<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Yes, not like before, where everyone had their own desk, in a hot-desking office there are certain number of desks and computers available for people to use, and anyone who needs them can use them.</p>

<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>This way, companies can save space by reducing the overall number of desks it needs to provide because not everyone is at work every day.</p>

<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>That's right. Throughout the year, there are always people on leave, away from the office or off sick. It's more common to see hot-desking in big organisations.</p>

<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Let's hear some examples of people talking about hot-desking.</p>

<p><strong>Examples<br /></strong>BBC New Broadcasting House is a hot-desking environment. People just sit wherever there is a free computer.</p>
<p>Hot desks should be kept clean and tidy at all times because you don't know who will use them next.</p>
<p>Many modern office workers are expected to hot-desk.</p>

<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>So we heard people using 'hot desk' in three different ways.</p>

<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Yes. Remember hot-desking is the noun form of the verb 'to hot-desk'.</p>

<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>When you write 'to hot-desk', don't forget 'hot' and 'desk' needs to be hyphenated.</p>

<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>The actual desk we use to do hot-desking is called a 'hot desk'&#151;without the hyphen between the two words.</p>

<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>OK, I think that's enough 'hot-desking' for now.</p>

<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Oh wait, Rob. I haven't got a desk today, I need to go and find a hot desk! Bye!</p>

<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Good luck! Bye bye.</p>
