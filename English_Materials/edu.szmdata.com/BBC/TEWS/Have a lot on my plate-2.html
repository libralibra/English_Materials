<table border="0">
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> This is a great restaurant, Finn. I'm glad we could finally come here and try out their new menu.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Finn:</td><td> It is a good restaurant, Feifei. But, well, I haven't been able to relax and enjoy a nice meal in the last few weeks.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> Really?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Finn:</td><td> Yes, well, I'm moving home soon&#160;...&#160;</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> Oh, I know how difficult it is to find a new flat.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Finn:</td><td>Yes. And my grandmother has been complaining that I don't visit her in Scotland very often&#160;...&#160;</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td>Yes, our elders like us to visit every now and again.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Finn:</td><td> And this new project at work&#160;...&#160;</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> I've noticed that you have been working late&#160;...&#160;</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Finn:</td><td>I simply have too much on my plate right now!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> Oh, if you have too much on your plate, can I help you?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Finn:</td><td>Yes, well, that would be nice&#160;...&#160;</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td>Leave it to me. Let me take some of this lovely looking chicken from you. Mmm&#160;... this is very tasty&#160;...&#160;</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Finn:</td><td>Feifei, what are you doing?! You're taking food from my plate?!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td>Mmm&#160;... I must find out how they cook this chicken. It tastes so good!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Finn:</td><td>Feifei, I didn't mean for you to take food from my plate. In English, when you say you 'have a lot on your plate' or 'too much on your plate', you mean you have a lot of work to do or a lot of problems to deal with.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> Problems?! That's not good.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Finn:</td><td>Yes. Well, it's not about food, but about work and problems. 'Have a lot on my plate' is today's expression in The English We Speak. Let's hear some examples of how it's used.</td></tr>
	<tr><td/><td class="examples">Ann has a lot on her plate at the moment. She's just had twins!</td></tr>
	<tr><td/><td class="examples">Sorry, but the manager can't speak to you today. The company is launching new products next week and she's got too much on her plate right now.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> Oh, so this expression has nothing to do with this delicious food you have on your plate.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Finn:</td><td> Come on, Feifei. You knew this expression already&#151;you just wanted to pinch my chicken!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> OK, OK, guilty as charged! This chicken looks so appetising&#160;... and these potatoes and&#160;...&#160;</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Finn:</td><td> Feifei, I can share them with you.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> Oh thank you, Finn. And you can share the workload, too. I can help you with your new project so you'll have time to go and visit your granny.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Finn:</td><td>Feifei, I'm very grateful. Here, have some more potatoes. And&#160;... I like the look of that carrot mash you have on your plate.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td>Here, have some&#160;... this food is lovely! We'll have clean plates in no time at all. Bye.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Finn:</td><td> Bye.</td></tr>
