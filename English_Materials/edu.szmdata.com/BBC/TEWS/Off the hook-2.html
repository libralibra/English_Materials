<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>When Neil arrives in the studio to present the programme, Feifei is already there. She's not in a very good mood and keeps repeating the same thing. What's wrong with Feifei? Listen to the programme to find out.</p>
<h3>Transcript</h3>


<p><strong>Neil</strong>
<br />Hello, Feifei. Already here, I see, to present The English We Speak.</p>


<p><strong>Feifei</strong>
<br />Actually, I haven't left the studio for a while, Neil. I need to go and eat something. Could you let me off the hook please?</p>


<p><strong>Neil</strong>
<br />Come on, Feifei, you have to present the programme with me. And today's expression is&hellip;</p>


<p><strong>Feifei</strong>
<br />I need to go to the toilet. Could you let me off the hook?</p>


<p><strong>Neil</strong>
<br />In English, to let someone off the hook means to free them from an obligation. You want to be let off the hook, don't you? You don't want to present the programme today.</p>


<p><strong>Feifei</strong>
<br />It can also mean to release someone from a difficult situation. I do need you to let me off the hook.</p>


<p><strong>Neil</strong>
<br />Let's hear some examples of how the expression 'to let someone off the hook' is used.</p>


<p><strong>Examples</strong>
<br />I haven't studied much but my teacher let me off the hook today. She's decided to postpone the test as long as I hit the books this week.</p>

<p>The team's supporters didn't let them off the hook. They booed the players off the pitch after they were beaten four-nil.</p>


<p><strong>Neil</strong>
<br />That's it then Feifei. You're off the hook now.</p>


<p><strong>Feifei</strong>
<br />No, I'm not.</p>


<p><strong>Neil</strong>
<br />Why not?</p>


<p><strong>Feifei</strong>
<br />My woollen jumper is caught on this hook on the wall just behind me and if I move I'll ruin it. Could you&hellip;</p>


<p><strong>Neil</strong>
<br />Yeah! Why didn't you say? Let me help you.</p>

<p>(Neil moves to release Feifei's jumper.)</p>


<p><strong>Feifei</strong>
<br />Oh be careful. I don't want it ripped!</p>


<p><strong>Neil</strong>
<br />I am being careful here&hellip; ah&hellip; yep, there you go now you're free. You're off the hook in every sense!</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Thanks, Neil.</p>


<p><strong>Both<br /></strong>Bye!</p>

<p></p>
