<h3>Transcript</h3>


<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>Ahhh&hellip; So cute! Sweet and cute!</p>


<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Cat videos on the computer, Li?</p>


<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>Yes, yes Rob. They're adorable!</p>


<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>What makes people so obsessed about these cat videos? Let me watch this one with you.</p>

<p>(cat meowing)</p>


<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Oh, I've seen this one! It's everywhere! Look how many people clicked on this site to see it. About one hundred thousand by now!</p>


<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>Yes, everybody loves Fluffy!</p>


<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Fluffy. Yes. This cat is fluffy and &hellip; crazy!</p>

<p>(cat growling)</p>


<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Look! It's gone viral!</p>


<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>What do you mean? Fluffy is MY cat and she's very well-behaved and healthy. No virus in my cat!</p>


<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>In English, the expression 'to go viral' is used for a picture or a video which has become extremely popular by being circulated quickly and broadly on the internet.</p>


<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>Oh, viral&hellip; you mean it spreads quickly like a virus.</p>


<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Yes. It can be used with a verb, 'to go viral', or just as an adjective before a noun. You can say 'viral video'. 'Viral' is today's expression in The English We Speak. Let's hear some examples of how it's used.</p>


<p><strong><span>Examples
<br /></span></strong><em>A video of First Lady Michelle Obama dancing with a turnip has gone viral on the internet. Hundreds of thousands of people have watched her video in support of healthy eating.</em></p>

<p><em>Viral videos are big business nowadays and even marketing companies are posting amateur-looking videos in the hope of cashing in on the trend.</em></p>


<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>So the viral part of what you said has been explained, but what about the 'crazy cat' part?</p>


<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Li, I'm sorry. The good part is that it's gone viral so everybody finds your cat interesting. But the bad part is&hellip;</p>


<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>Is&hellip;?</p>


<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Is that you've got a very angry cat! Very fluffy and very angry! I know you love your pet but you've got to admit it is funny. Let's watch it again.</p>

<p>(cat growling)</p>


<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>It is funny!</p>


<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>You see? There you go. Fluffy is a star!</p>


<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>Yes. Thank you, Rob!</p>


<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>You're welcome. Bye bye.</p>


<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>Bye.</p>
