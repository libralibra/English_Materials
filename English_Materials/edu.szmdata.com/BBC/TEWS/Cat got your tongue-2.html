<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>Feifei's unusually quiet today&#151;maybe it's got something to do with the cat that Rob has brought into the office? But what has the cat's tongue got to do with it&#151;or is there just some confusion about another English expression?</p>
<h3>Transcript</h3>


<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Hello and welcome to The English We Speak. I'm Rob, and joining me is Feifei.</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Hello. (sneezes)</p>


<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Bless you!</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>(sneezes)</p>


<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Are you ok? Have you got a cold?</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>No, not a cold. Something's making me sneeze. Errr&#160;... Rob, is that a cat on your lap?!</p>


<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Yes. Meet Tiddles. I decided to bring him to the office because he gets lonely at home on his own&hellip; don't you Tiddley-widdly? It's a good idea, don't you think? Feifei? You've gone all quiet&#151;you've usually got something to say. Feifei?</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>(sneezes)</p>


<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Can you speak? Cat got your tongue?</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>No! Your cat has not got my tongue&#151;or anything else&#151;I'm allergic to cats.</p>


<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Oh dear Feifei&#151;but saying 'cat got your tongue?' means 'you're very quiet' or 'you've got nothing to say'.</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Really?! Well let's hear some examples of this phrase&hellip;</p>


<p><strong>Examples<br /></strong>What's the matter? Cat got your tongue? I did say we'd use up all our money on the car!</p>

<p>A: Has the cat got your tongue? You usually go on about how amazing your boyfriend is.
<br />B: We split up.</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>So 'cat got your tongue?' is an informal question you might say to someone who isn't saying much. [sneezes]</p>


<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Oh I get it now. You weren't saying much because you were too busy sneezing!</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>No Rob. I was angry because you know I am allergic to cats&#151;don't you remember me saying that I can't be in the same room as one? Rob? Rob! What's wrong? Cat got your tongue now?</p>


<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>It appears Tiddles needed the toilet&hellip; but it's too late now. I'm all wet!</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Oh Rob. You stink! I'm off. Bye.</p>
