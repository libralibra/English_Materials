<p class="storyTitle">What's the damage?</p>
<table border="0">
	<tr><td class="roles">Jen:</td><td> Hello, I'm Jen&#151;and with me in the studio today is Helen!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> Hi!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Jen:</td><td> Helen, just before we get started&#151;did you get the chance to go to the farmers' market for me? I didn't have time to go myself.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> I did, I chose some things I thought you'd like&#160;... Here we are&#160;... I bought some fresh apples, some crunchy carrots, a load of onions, a loaf of fresh bread and a jar of delicious honey.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Jen:</td><td> Brilliant&#151;thanks so much for doing that for me, I can't wait to try it. So what's the damage?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> Damage? I don't think there's any damage really. Although I suppose one of the apples is a little bit bruised and I nibbled the end of one of the carrots but it'll be fine if you just cut it a little bit.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Jen:</td><td> I don't mean damage to the food. The phrase "what's the damage?" can be used to ask how much money you owe someone for something.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> So you wanted to find out how much you owe me for the food?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Jen:</td><td> That's right&#151;let's hear a couple of examples of the phrase in use. <em>
<br /></em></td></tr>
	<tr><td/><td class="examples">What a lovely meal&#151;I think we should split the bill two ways though, so what's the damage?</td></tr>
	<tr><td/><td class="examples">Thanks so much for fixing the brakes on my car. What's the damage for the work you've done?</td></tr><p>
<br /><strong>Helen:</strong> So you could say "what's the damage?" in a restaurant or a cafe?
<table border="0">
	<tr><td class="roles">Jen:</td><td> That's right; you might use the phrase amongst friends when you get a bill, or you might hear it if you are paying a workman to do something. Generally we use it when we don't know how much something is going to cost or if the price has been estimated beforehand.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> Like when I went to the market for you today!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Jen:</td><td> Yeah, I didn't know how much it would cost so I asked you "what's the damage?" So how much do I owe you?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> £12.50.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Jen:</td><td> £12.50?! That's pretty expensive.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> It's worth it when you look at the quality of the food&#151;it's very good.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Jen:</td><td> Alright then, here you are&#151;£12.50.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> And here YOU are.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Jen:</td><td> Let's have a look then&#160;... Apples, yum&#160;... Well, they do look a little more bruised than you mentioned&#160;...&#160;</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> Yes, sorry, I dropped the bag&#160;...&#160;</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Jen:</td><td> Look at the carrots! You said you'd nibbled them, but there are only the tops of them left! I can't cook with those!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> I was peckish, sorry.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Jen:</td><td> At least this jar of honey looks good&#160;... it's empty!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> Sorry, sorry! It looked so delicious that I couldn't help it!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Jen:</td><td> Well, I think you should give me my money back. I'm not paying for food that's already been eaten!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> OK, what if we go out for a meal and I pay?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Jen:</td><td> Hmm&#160;... OK&#160;...&#160;
<br />
<br />Later on&#160;...&#160;</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Jen:</td><td> I'm stuffed! The apple and honey pie was really delicious.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> Here's the waiter with the bill. Now don't forget, this is my treat after eating all of your food. Ooh, er&#160;... This is embarrassing.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Jen:</td><td> Is it expensive? What's the damage?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> It's £40 for the meal but I've just remembered&#160;...&#160;</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Jen:</td><td> What?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> I left my purse at the farmers' market! Can you pay for us?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Jen:</td><td> Argh!</td></tr>
