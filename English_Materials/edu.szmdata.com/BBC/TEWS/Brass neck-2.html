<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>If you have a neck made of brass how does it make you behave? Feifei discovers an expression about being confident that shouldn't be taken literally!</p>
<h3>Transcript</h3>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Hello I'm Feifei and this is The English We Speak.</p>


<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Yes, it is. And hello I'm Rob.</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>I don't know about you Rob, but I seem to have so much work to do at the moment.</p>


<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Yeah, me too. We've got to meet that deadline by Friday.</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>I guess we've all got lots to do&#151;and that's why I was surprised that Phyllis has asked to take three days off work this week.</p>


<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Three days? Are you sure? Maybe she's unwell?</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>No, she's fine&#151;I heard her say to the boss in a very loud voice 'I've got a great deal on a flight to Italy so I need to take the rest of the week off.'</p>


<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>What cheek&#151;she's got a <strong>brass neck</strong>.</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>A <strong>brass neck</strong>? Phyllis has a <strong>brass neck</strong>! Really&#151;when did she get that&#151;maybe she needs a holiday to recover from the operation?</p>


<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>No no no Feifei. Her neck isn't actually made of brass&#151;I just mean she is confident but also a bit rude&#151;she can do or say things that most of us would be too embarrassed to do or say.</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Yes, she just doesn't care what she says does she? So if someone is described as having a <strong>brass neck</strong>, it means they are confident and say or do what they want but doesn't understand their behaviour might be unacceptable to others.</p>


<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Yes, she certainly doesn't worry about what other people think of her. A bit like people in these examples&hellip;</p>


<p><strong>Examples<br /></strong>My ex-boyfriend's got a <strong>brass neck</strong>, coming round and asking me to do his washing!</p>

<p>The customer has a <strong>brass neck</strong> asking for a refund when it was obvious he had already worn the shoes.</p>

<p>She's got a <strong>brass neck</strong> telling the boss that he wasn't very good at his job&#151;I would never say that!</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>So having a <strong>brass neck</strong> means you are extremely confident about your own actions but you don't understand that your behaviour might be unacceptable to others. So it's not like us Rob?</p>


<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Absolutely not. Although, I was wondering if you wouldn't mind writing the notes for the presentation we're doing? I've got to meet someone for lunch.</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Ermm&hellip;.</p>


<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Come on Feifei, you love writing presentations&hellip;. Oh why are you looking so brassed off?</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Brassed off&#151;you mean I'm looking annoyed and disappointed&#151;maybe I'm looking brassed off because of your <strong>brass neck</strong>.</p>


<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>I'll take that as 'no' then. Oh well, at least you understand this English expression now!</p>


<p><strong>Both<br /></strong>Bye!</p>
