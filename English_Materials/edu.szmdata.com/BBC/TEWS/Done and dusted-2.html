<h3>Transcript</h3>

<p>Note: This is not a word-for-word transcript</p>

<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Hello, and welcome to The English We Speak, I'm Neil and joining me in the studio today is Helen.</p>

<p><strong>Helen<br /></strong>Hello everyone. It's nice to relax a bit. It's been a crazy few weeks. We had just four weeks to buy our new home.</p>

<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Oh no, four weeks! That's really not much time.</p>

<p><strong>Helen<br /></strong>I know. Luckily the lawyers were very helpful. We got the mortgage in time and we completed the purchase last weekend.</p>

<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>So you've finally got your own place.</p>

<p><strong>Helen<br /></strong>Yes, the money has exchanged hands and we got our keys yesterday!</p>

<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Brilliant, so it's all done and dusted then.</p>

<p><strong>Helen<br /></strong>No, we haven't had the chance to inspect the house yet. Never mind dusting it.</p>

<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>I wasn't talking about dusting the house!</p>

<p><strong>Helen<br /></strong>But I heard you ask if it was done and dusted.</p>

<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Oh, it's just a way of saying everything is OK now&#151;nothing else needs doing. You've closed the deal on your house purchase. It's done and dusted.</p>

<p><strong>Helen<br /></strong>So the phrase done and dusted means work on something is completely finished. When I heard you say dust, I thought you were asking me if I had cleaned the house. No way, I only got the keys yesterday! I haven't even set foot in the house yet.</p>

<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Done and dusted is actually a very common expression. We hear it a lot at work. And usually it means something has been completed successfully, there's no more work to be done on it. Let's hear some examples.</p>

<p><strong>Examples<br /></strong></p>
<p><em>The dispute between me and the council about my parking ticket has been resolved. It's done and dusted.</em></p>
<p><em>After two months of hard work, the project is finally done and dusted.</em></p>
<p><em>About this logo design&#160;... as far as I'm concerned, it's done and dusted.</em></p>

<p><strong>Helen<br /></strong>Done and dusted is a popular casual expression, it's used to talk about something that's finished successfully.</p>

<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>That's right. And this programme is now done and dusted.</p>

<p><strong>Helen<br /></strong>Thanks for listening. Join us next time for more useful English expressions.</p>

<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Bye.</p>

<p><strong>Helen<br /></strong>Bye.</p>
