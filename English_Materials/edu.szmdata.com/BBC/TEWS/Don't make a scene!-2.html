	<tr><td class="roles">Neil:</td><td> 'To make a scene' is an expression we use in English to describe when somebody causes a disturbance or is loud in public. Often it's embarrassing. Let's hear some examples of how this expression is used:</td></tr>
	<tr><td/><td class="examples">I will never go back to the restaurant again. Last night Jane made a scene when the waiter brought fish instead of the beef she had ordered! It was very embarrassing.</td></tr>
	<tr><td/><td class="examples">Don't make a scene, Alan! We are not married yet and I can go out with whoever I like&#151;including your best friend!</td></tr><p>
<br /><strong>Feifei:</strong> I'm sorry, Neil. I didn't mean to embarrass you or cause a disturbance. But I was looking forward to this! What's this taxi driver doing here?
<table border="0">
	<tr><td class="roles">Taxi&#160;driver:</td><td> (Approaches them in a hurry) There you are, sir. I found these tickets on the back seat of my taxi. They might have slipped from your pocket.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Neil:</td><td> Oh, thank you so much! Feifei was really angry. Now, the drama is over!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> You mean the drama is about to start! You're the best taxi driver in the world! And you are my very good friend, Neil! You are my best friend ever!</td></tr>
