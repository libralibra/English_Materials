	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> (aside) Cricket is not really my sport but&#160;...&#160;(pretending to be interested) yes Rob, it's wonderful. Such an exciting game! I love cricket, especially when a goal is scored.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Err&#160;... that's in football Feifei.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> Oh yes, of course, I knew that. I am really quite an expert on cricket, you know.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Really? So what do we call that man over there who's throwing the ball?</td></tr>

But the word stumped has another meaning: It means you can't answer a question or you don't know how to solve a problem.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> I see. So it means you're stuck and don't know what to say or do. Well, it's true Rob, your question has 'stumped' me!</td></tr>
