	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Err, hi Helen.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> Hello Rob. Welcome to my comfort zone.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Your what?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> My comfort zone. I’ve made a very comfortable area for relaxing in. Don’t you think it’s relaxing Rob?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Well yes. Nice cushions, a very cosy sofa and soft lighting&#151;but Helen, why did you want to show me this relaxing and comfortable room&#151;are you up to something?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> No! You said we were doing a programme about comfort zones&#151;so I decided to make one.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> I see. Well we could describe this room as our comfort zone but usually the term refers to how someone feels.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> Oh! So it’s not just a place, but a state of mind.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Yes. If someone is in their comfort zone, they feel secure and comfortable, they might even feel in control. Maybe these examples will help to explain more&#160;...&#160;</td></tr>
	<tr><td/><td class="examples">John isn’t going for the promotion&#151;he wants to stay in his comfort zone and doesn’t want the extra stress.</td></tr>
	<tr><td/><td class="examples">Jane stays in her comfort zone when booking her holiday and will never travel overseas.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> So those examples describe people who are happy doing something they’ve always done. They feel safe and secure.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> It sounds like a nice place to be.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> It is but it can also imply you won’t take risks and move out of your comfort zone&#160;...&#160;</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td>&#160;...&#160;into your un-comfort zone you mean or your non-comfort zone?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Exactly. Listen to these examples&#160;...&#160;</td></tr>
	<tr><td/><td class="examples">Sally is dressing outside her usual comfort zone; have you seen the dress she’s wearing tonight?!</td></tr>
	<tr><td/><td class="examples">Bob’s working outside his comfort zone by agreeing to run the accounts department.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> A comfort zone can also describe the ideal temperature of a room. It’s just the right conditions to feel comfortable in&#151;not too hot, not too cold.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> Well Rob, I think we’re in just the right comfort zone now.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> We are but come on, let’s step outside and get some fresh air.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> Sorry Rob, I’m staying in my comfort zone. Mmm, it’s so cosy and I feel so secure here and anyway, it might be raining out there.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> You don’t take any chances Helen! Oh well, see you later. Bye.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> Bye! Oh this sofa is so comfortable, mmm&#160;...&#160;</td></tr>
