<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>Neil and Feifei are sharpening an axe in the studio. Why? To teach you a useful expression which has several, slightly different meanings.</p>
<h3>Transcript</h3>


<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Hello and welcome to The English We Speak, I'm Neil and joining me is Feifei&hellip;</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Hiya.</p>


<p><strong>Neil</strong>
<br /> Feifei, can you explain to our listeners why I'm sharpening an axe in the studio.</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Yes, I can&#151;because in this programme, we've got an expression for you which contains the word 'axe'. It can have three different meanings: 1&#151;to have an opinion you want other people to accept.</p>


<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>2&#151;to be angry or upset about something. to have a hidden plan.</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>And 3&#151;to have a hidden plan.</p>


<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>The expression is 'to have an axe to grind'. If you can imagine in the past, if someone did something bad to you, you might want to get revenge&#151;and hurt the person. So you might need a sharp weapon&#151;like an axe!</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>That's horrible.</p>


<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>In modern use, you can say that someone 'has an axe to grind' but it doesn't mean they're going to attack you with an axe!</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Let's hear some examples of the different meanings of this expression.</p>


<p><strong>Examples<br /></strong>Oh no here comes Roger. He's got an axe to grind about smoking, so you'd better put that cigarette out or he'll be talking to you for hours about your health.</p>

<p>Don't suggest getting dinner from Yummy Chicken. Jim's had an axe to grind since they fired him last month.</p>

<p>These local politicians have always got an axe to grind. You know they're hiding something from you.</p>


<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>So, in the first example, the expression 'to have an axe to grind' means to have an opinion you want people to accept. Roger is anti-smoking and he tells smokers just what he thinks of them. He has an axe to grind</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>In the second, Jim got fired by Yummy Chicken so he's upset and angry with the company. He wants some kind of revenge. He's got an axe to grind.</p>


<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>And in the third one, the politicians are keeping secrets from people. There's something they want to do that they aren't telling you. They have an axe to grind. We should say that this use isn't very common in British English.</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Well now that's explained, Neil, I think you should put that axe away before someone gets hurt.</p>


<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Good idea. It's very sharp now&#151;feel it.</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Argh! I'll have an axe to grind if you don't put that weapon away!</p>


<p><strong>Both<br /></strong>Bye!</p>
