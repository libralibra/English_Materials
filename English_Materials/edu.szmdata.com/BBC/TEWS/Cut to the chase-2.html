<p class="storyTitle">Cut to the chase</p>
<p><em>(Finn and Feifei are in the car going to work)</em>
<table border="0">
	<tr><td class="roles">Finn:</td><td> Thank you for driving me to work today, Feifei. It's a nice car.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> Yeah, it's brand new.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Finn:</td><td> It must have cost a lot of money. By the way, I noticed you had a meeting with the boss yesterday&#160;... and you look very happy today. Good news?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> Yes, very good news. First the boss offered me&#160;...&#160;</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Finn:</td><td> A pay rise?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> Tea. And then he offered me&#160;...&#160;</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Finn:</td><td> A promotion?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> Biscuits. And then he asked me&#160;...&#160;</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Finn:</td><td> He asked you if you want a post abroad?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> If my chair was comfortable.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Finn:</td><td> Oh, come on Feifei, cut to the chase!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> Cut to the chase!? Is there anyone chasing us? Let's go faster. See if he is still behind us.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Finn:</td><td> Slow down, Feifei! Nobody is chasing us!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> Okay, okay!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Finn:</td><td> Oh. That was quite an adventure. In English, we say "cut to the chase" when we want to hear the most important piece of information; we want someone telling us something to get to the point!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> Ah! It might come from the movies. The chase is usually the most exciting part.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Finn:</td><td> Yes. Let's hear some examples:</td></tr>
</table>
<ul>
	<li>The salesman went on and on about the computer's new features till I told him: "Cut to the chase! What is the price?"</li>
	<li>We've been going out for five years. Let's cut to the chase. Just tell me: Are you going to marry me?</li>
</ul><p>
<br /><strong>Feifei:</strong> So that's what "cut to the chase" means.
<table border="0">
	<tr><td class="roles">Finn:</td><td> Sure. So Feifei "cut to the chase" and tell me: What did the boss offer you?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> I've just told you.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Finn:</td><td> What? What was it?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> He asked me if my chair, the one by my desk, was comfortable. So I told him it wasn't. And he offered me a new chair so that I can work longer hours in comfort.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Finn:</td><td> Is that all!?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> Yes. I'm always complaining about my bad back.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Finn:</td><td> Well. I don't have a bad back but I'm aching for a pay rise. Let's go to the office. Bye.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> Bye.</td></tr>
	<tr><td/><td class="examples">(car starting)</td></tr>
