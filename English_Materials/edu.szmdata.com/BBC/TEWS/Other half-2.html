	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Oh! I didn't know you call your wife your other half. That's interesting.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Neil:</td><td> Yes. That's a phrase often used by married couples to refer to each other.</td></tr>

<ul>
	<li><em>A: How's your other half? Is she feeling better?</em></li>
	<li><em>B: Yes, she is much better, thanks.</em></li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><em>Lady: I like the colour of the car but I should ask my other half before I buy it.</em></li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><em>A: Fancy another pint, John?</em></li>
	<li><em>B: I'd love another pint but I have promised my other half I'll be home early.</em></li>
</ul><p>
<br /><strong>Neil:</strong> So, people often refer to their partner as their other half.
<table border="0">
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Can this phrase be used to refer to both a husband and a wife?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Neil:</td><td> Yes, that's correct. And sometimes a man will refer to his wife as his 'better half'.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Better half? Of course the woman is always the better half! Wouldn't you agree?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Neil:</td><td> Of course! My wife always reminds me that she's my better half!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Let's listen to a couple of examples:</td></tr>
</table>
<ul>
	<li><em>A: Oh what a lovely room, you've made a great job of this.</em></li>
	<li><em>B: Thanks, but compliments should really go to my better half, she chose all the colours and the furniture.</em></li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><em>A: Thanks for dinner last night. The food was fantastic!</em></li>
	<li><em>B: You're welcome. I'm glad you enjoyed it. It was a fun evening.</em><em> I'm really lucky, my better half is a great cook, I just have to do all the washing up.</em></li>
</ul><p>
<br /><strong>Li:</strong> I'm sure your wife thinks you are the better half although she may not say it.
<table border="0">
	<tr><td class="roles">Neil:</td><td> I hope so.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Well, just check with your better half and let me know if you are coming on Saturday.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Neil:</td><td> I will do, thank you.</td></tr>
