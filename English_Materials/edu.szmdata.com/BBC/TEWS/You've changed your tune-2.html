	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Hello and welcome to The English We Speak. My name is Yang Li.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">William:</td><td> (mouth full) And I'm William, mmf, mmf.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> My dear co-presenter William! Don't you know it's rude to speak with your mouth full? Particularly in a BBC audio programme!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">William:</td><td> (smacking lips) Well, I do know that but I've really been enjoying this super jumbo hamburger. Wow, that was so good. I just can't get enough of super jumbo hamburgers recently.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Oh? So what is it about super jumbo hamburgers that you like so much?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">William:</td><td> Well, good question Li. I think it might be the delicious 100% beef burger and how the flavours merge with the sauce, which is made to a carefully-guarded recipe. But then again I like the lovely gherkins and the crisp crunchy lettuce. But also let's not forget the layers of soft yellow cheese. Maybe it's all of those things. Hmmm. I think I could have another actually.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Well Will, all I can say is: you have changed your tune.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">William:</td><td> Hmm&#160;... That's an interesting phrase, Li. Shall we make it our phrase of the day?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Sure, why not?</p><p>If you change your tune, you change your attitude towards something or someone.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">William:</td><td> It's a slightly critical phrase, but in a jokey sort of way. Let's hear another example:</td></tr>
	<tr>
		<td/>
		<td>
			<table border="0" class="examples">
				<tr><td class="roles">Girl&#160;1:</td><td>What do you think about Mark? Don't you think he's really good-looking?</td></tr>
				<tr><td class="roles">Girl&#160;2:</td><td>Mark? I thought you hated him?</td></tr>
				<tr><td class="roles">Girl&#160;1:</td><td>That was last week. This week, I feel very different&#160;...&#160;</td></tr>
				<tr><td class="roles">Girl&#160;2:</td><td>Wow, you've certainly changed your tune!</td></tr>
			</table>

	</tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Hmmm. I have to say I don't think I change my tune very often.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">William:</td><td> Well, I'm sure that's true but we don't generally use the phrase to talk about ourselves. We tend to always say: "You've changed your tune" or "You've certainly changed your tune." And we say it like this: "<em>You've</em> changed your tune".</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> OK. And you have certainly changed your tune, William, about super jumbo hamburgers.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">William:</td><td> No&#160;... I've always loved those things!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> No, trust me, Will. Hang on&#160;... Here you go. Two weeks ago you said this: "I hate super jumbo hamburgers. The meat is like low-grade frozen cardboard, the cheese is like plastic and the tomatoes are like rubber. After I eat one I just want to curl up in bed." That's what you said!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">William:</td><td> Oh, right. Well, I guess they must have grown on me.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> What a change of tune, from William, the burger hater to William, the burger lover!</td></tr>
