<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>

<p>When things are not going as planned, we can say they've gone 'down the pan', but which pan is it? Find out from Neil.</p>


<p><strong>Transcript</strong></p>

<p>Note: This is not a word-for-word transcript.</p>
<p><span><strong>Helen<br /></strong></span><span>Hello and welcome to Authentic Real English. I'm Helen and joining me today is Neil.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Neil <br /></strong></span><span>Hello everyone. You know my friend Jeff the documentary maker?</span></p>

<p><strong><span>Helen</span></strong>
<br /><span>Oh yeah.
<br />
<br /></span><strong><span>Neil
<br /></span></strong><span>Well he had this great story he was about to make a film about&#151;the most expensive wedding in the UK.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Helen<br /></strong></span><span>So what happened? Has he finished it?</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Neil<br /></strong></span><span>He was due to film the wedding on Saturday. Then yesterday, he got a call from the bride.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Helen<br /></strong></span><span>Don't tell me the wedding is off.</span></p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1"><strong>Neil<br /></strong></span><span data-mce-mark="1">It is. After all that hard work, everything just went down the pan.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Helen<br /></strong></span><span>Went down the pan? What pan?</span></p>

<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>It's an expression we use informally to say something disastrous has happened. It's not the cooking pan we are referring to here. It's actually the toilet!</p>

<p><strong><span data-mce-mark="1">Helen
<br /></span></strong><span data-mce-mark="1">The toilet! Oh yuck!</span></p>

<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Just imagine, when you flush the toilet, everything gets washed down the pipe. That's what I mean&#151;'down the pan', everything's gone! Total disaster! Here are a few examples:</p>

<p><strong><span data-mce-mark="1">Examples
<br /></span></strong><span data-mce-mark="1">Jason had great dreams of becoming a football player, but they went down the pan when he broke his leg.</span></p>
<p><span>I'm afraid all that careful preparation we did for Jemma's surprise birthday party went down the pan when her brother told her about it.</span></p>
<p><span>He was ready to move into his new home, but everything went down the pan when the fire destroyed the house last night.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Helen<br /></strong></span><span>I get it. If things are going completely wrong and a lot of effort is wasted we can use the phrase 'down the pan'.</span></p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1"><strong>Neil<br /></strong></span><span data-mce-mark="1">That's right. Er, Helen, I think you forgot to press the record button on this programme.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Helen<br /></strong></span><span>Oh no. What a disaster. Neil, would you mind re-recording this?</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Neil<br /></strong></span>(Sigh). Helen, that's my tea break down the pan.</p>
