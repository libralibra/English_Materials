<h3>Transcript</h3>

<p>Note: This is not a word-for-word transcript</p>

<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Hello, this is The English We Speak, with me Feifei&hellip;</p>

<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>[singing badly] And me Rob. Hello!</p>

<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Err Rob, what is that terrible noise?</p>

<p><strong>Rob</strong>
<br />Noise? This is my best singing voice&#151;I need it for my new job.</p>

<p><strong>Feifei</strong>
<br />You didn't tell me you were leaving the BBC and going to a new job.</p>

<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>I'm not&#151;I've got a new part-time job in the evenings to earn a bit of extra cash [tries singing again].</p>

<p><strong>Feifei</strong>
<br />Hmm&#151;and this second job involves singing, does it?</p>

<p><strong>Rob</strong>
<br />Yes, that's right. I'm going to be a cabaret singer in a nightclub. Good news, isn't it?</p>

<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Well, Rob, don't give up the day job!</p>

<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Oh&#151;that's an expression which means someone's not very good at doing something and isn't likely ever to be successful at doing it.</p>

<p><strong>Feifei</strong>
<br />Yes&#151;but it's used in a humorous and light-hearted way Rob. Sorry, I was trying to be nice.</p>

<p><strong>Rob</strong>
<br />OK. Well, I think we'd better hear some examples of this phrase in action while I continue to practice my singing [starts singing again].</p>

<p><strong>Feifei</strong>
<br />Oh no!</p>

<p><strong>Examples<br /></strong>I wouldn't give up the day job&#151;you're never going to be an actor!</p>
<p>Do you really want to be a writer? I've read your first book and my advice is 'don't give up the day job'!</p>
<p>Don't give up the day job Pete&#151;you're never going to earn a living as a singer!</p>

<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>So 'don't give up the day job' means you should continue doing your normal job, rather than trying to turn your hobby into a career. So Rob, have you got the message?</p>

<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Oh yes, I should stick to what I'm good at&#151;so I'll concentrate on doing the day job shall I?</p>

<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Yes, good idea.</p>

<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>OK, so why we don't we sing together and entertain our listeners [starts singing]?!</p>

<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Oh Rob, perhaps you should give up the <em>day</em> job as well.</p>

<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Oh thanks.</p>

<p><strong>Both<br /></strong>Bye!</p>
