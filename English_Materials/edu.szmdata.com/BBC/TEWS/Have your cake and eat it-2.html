	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Take a look at this brochure.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Jen:</td><td> (Reading) "Golden palm beach, Barbados. This resort boasts miles of unspoiled beaches, crystal blue waters and five star accommodation&#160;...&#160;" Is this where you're going on holiday, Li?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Yes, I just booked it.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Jen:</td><td> Well, you don't sound very happy about it, what's the problem?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Well, it cost me Â£5,000!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Jen:</td><td> That's a lot of money.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> I know, and I wanted to save my money so that I could get my bathroom decorated.</td></tr>

	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Then why do you want me to stop eating cake?!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Jen:</td><td> Calm down. I said, "You can't have your cake and eat it." We use this phrase in English to mean that you can't have something both ways.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Oh. So you mean I can't spend my money and save it at the same time?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles"></strong>
<br /><strong>Jen:</td><td> Exactly. Let's hear some more examples:</td></tr>
</table>
<ul>
	<li>He's just got married, but he misses the single life. Well it's too bad&#151;you can't have your cake and eat it!</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>I drank a whole bottle of champagne at the party last night, but now I feel sick&#151;I've got the worst hangover ever. But I suppose you can't have your cake and eat it!</li>
</ul><p>
<br /><strong>Li:</strong> The second example is good&#151;you can't expect to drink a lot of alcohol without feeling the effects the next day: you can't have it both ways; you can't have your cake and eat it.
<table border="0">
	<tr><td class="roles">Jen:</td><td> And you can't have your lovely holiday without spending a lot of money on it.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> I suppose you're right.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Jen:</td><td> All this talk of cake has got my stomach rumbling, I feel really hungry now.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> There's a new cafe across the road which is selling little cupcakes, they look really delicious! We could go and get some after the programme?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Jen:</td><td> I would love to, but I can't, I want to save my money to go out to dinner tonight.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Oh well Jen, you can't have your cake and eat it. I'll just get one for myself!</td></tr>
