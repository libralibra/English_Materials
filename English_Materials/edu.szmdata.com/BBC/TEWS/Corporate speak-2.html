<table border="0">
	<tr><td class="roles">Finn:</td><td> Hi Li. I didn't see you in the canteen today. I brought you a sandwich.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> That's very kind of you, Finn. I had to go and buy these&#160;...&#160;</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Finn:</td><td> An envelope and a nice picture of a sunny beach?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> It's the sky, Finn. My boss told me that we need blue-sky thinking and we need to push the envelope if we want to succeed in the current market.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Finn:</td><td>Oh, right. And what are you going to do with this envelope, and this picture, Li?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td>Well, the beach has a blue-sky&#160;... so maybe I need to push it into the envelope&#160;... and send it to&#160;... the clients? I'm not sure.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Finn:</td><td> Li, I think what he wants has nothing to do with the sky or envelopes. These are two expressions people use in business nowadays. It's corporate language&#151;or as we say, corporate speak.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> What do they mean?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Finn:</td><td>Well, in English, 'blue-sky thinking' means having ideas which are very original, even if they're not practical or realistic. Your boss wants you to be creative.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> And what do I do with this envelope?!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Finn:</td><td>Well, the expression 'to push the envelope' means to go even further than others and do things that might be new or risky or even dangerous! That's: push the envelope.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> But why didn't he just say: be creative?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Finn:</td><td>Well, the world of business has its own special terms. Let's hear some examples of how to use these two expressions in today's The English We Speak.</td></tr>
	<tr><td/><td class="examples">It's all about</em><em>blue-sky thinking right now; mobile phones are no longer just for calls!</td></tr>
	<tr><td/><td class="examples">We're not just a normal airline. We're going to push the envelope and offer balloon flights.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Oh, so all my boss wants is for me to have ideas which are new and brave. What about your boss, Finn?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Finn:</td><td> Well, my line manager told me this morning: "I expect you to think out of the box. If you don't step up to the plate by end of play you'll have to face the music."</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td>What on earth does he mean, Finn?!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Finn:</td><td>I really have no idea. I think we'd need another four programmes to explain those examples of corporate speak. Another time. I'm tired just thinking about it. Bye.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Bye.</td></tr>
