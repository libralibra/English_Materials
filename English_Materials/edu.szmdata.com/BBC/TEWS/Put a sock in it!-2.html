<h3>Transcript</h3>

<p>Note: This is not a word-for-word transcript</p>

<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Welcome to The English We Speak with me Rob&#151;and today I've come round to Helen's house because she said she needed some help&#160;...&#160;<em>(Doorbell and door opens)</em></p>

<p><strong>Helen<br /></strong>Oh hi Rob. Thanks for coming round. <em>(She shuts the door)</em></p>

<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>That's OK, no problem. Now, how can I help?</p>

<p><strong>Helen<br /></strong>I need you to fix my toaster please. You know me, I love my toast but since yesterday, every time I try to make some, black smoke keeps coming out of it.</p>

<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Hmm, black smoke? That doesn't sound good. OK, let's have a look at it&#160;... Err, Helen?</p>

<p><strong>Helen<br /></strong>Yes?</p>

<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>There's a sock in it&#151;that's very dangerous&#151;no wonder you're getting black smoke when you try to make toast!</p>

<p><strong>Helen<br /></strong>Rob, I put the sock in there.</p>

<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>You put the sock in there&#151;why did you do that?</p>

<p><strong>Helen<br /></strong>Well, my friend came round for breakfast yesterday, and I was telling her all about my fantastic holiday&#160;... the great weather, the good food and the&#160;... handsome men&#160;...&#160;</p>

<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>So?</p>

<p><strong>Helen<br /></strong>Well, I was making us both toast when she said 'Helen, put a sock in it!'</p>

<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Ah! I don't think she actually meant put a sock in the toaster&#151;when people say that, it means 'be quiet'!</p>

<p><strong>Helen</strong>
<br /> How rude! 'Put a sock in it' isn't a very polite thing to say Rob!</p>

<p><strong>Rob</strong>
<br /> It's not. It's an impolite way of saying 'stop talking'! It can also mean, keep the noise down. Your friend must have been annoyed by your non-stop chatter if she said that! Let's hear some more examples of this phrase in action&#160;...&#160;</p>

<p><strong>Examples<br /></strong>Put a sock in it! We're trying to do some work here!
<br />
<br /> Oh, put a sock in it! I've already said I'm going to do the washing-up later.</p>
<p>My Dad was telling me how I should work harder at school so I told him to 'put a sock in it!'</p>

<p><strong>Helen<br /></strong>So the phrase 'to put a sock in it' really means 'be quiet' or 'shut up'. But Rob, I don't talk that much, it's just I like to tell people about my holidays, my cooking, my boyfriends&#160;...&#160;</p>

<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Err, Helen&#160;...&#160;</p>

<p><strong>Helen<br /></strong>Yes?</p>

<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Can you put a sock in it please?! In fact, use this&#160;... dirty sock from your toaster!</p>

<p><strong>Helen<br /></strong>But where should I put it?</p>

<p><strong>Rob</strong>
<br />Well, figuratively speaking, the phrase means put a sock in your mouth to stop you talking&#151;so try that!</p>

<p><strong>Helen</strong>
<br /> Oh thanks. <em>(Toaster pops up)</em> Actually, now my toaster is working, I'm going to have socks on toast!</p>

<p><strong>Rob</strong>
<br /> <em>(Sniffing the sock)</em> Well, by the smell of this sock, it's going to be <em>cheese</em> on toast.</p>

<p><strong>Both<br /></strong>Bye!</p>
