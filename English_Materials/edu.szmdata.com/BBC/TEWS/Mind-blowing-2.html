<h3>Transcript</h3>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Hello and welcome to The English We Speak. I'm Feifei and joining me is Harry.</p>


<p><strong>Harry<br /></strong>Hello there! And the expression we are going to look at in this programme is 'mind-blowing', or, 'to blow your mind'.</p>


<p><strong>Feifei</strong></p>

<p>To blow your mind! We'll look at what it means and when you can use it. So anyway, Harry, I've heard you really like travelling.</p>


<p><strong>Harry<br /></strong>Me? Yeah, I love travelling, to be free. Yeah, I've travelled.</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Where have you been?</p>


<p><strong>Harry<br /></strong>All over: Europe, South East Asia, North Africa, Central America.</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>So, which was the best trip?</p>


<p><strong>Harry<br /></strong>Hard to say, they were all great in their own way, but I think my trip to Cambodia really stands out.</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Why's that?</p>


<p><strong>Harry<br /></strong>Well, it's got scenery, beaches, nice food and all that stuff, but the temples at Angkor Wat&#151;well, they just blew my mind.</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>They blew your mind?!</p>


<p><strong>Harry<br /></strong>Yeah, it's an amazing place. It's got incredible statues, roads, waterways all abandoned in the forest. Truly mind-blowing.</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>But what does it mean&#151;mind blowing; it blew your mind?</p>


<p><strong>Harry<br /></strong>Oh right. Well, when something is so incredible, so surprising that we stop and wonder about how amazing it is, we can say it's mind-blowing, or that it blew our minds, as though our brains have broken down because they are so overwhelmed.</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>I see. So what else can be mind-blowing?</p>


<p><strong>Harry<br /></strong>Anything amazing: a painting, a film, a story.</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>And what about nature&#151;the ocean, the planets, the insect world?</p>


<p><strong>Harry<br /></strong>Yes, the unexplored ocean depths, the size of the other planets, the huge number and variety of insects&#151;those things are all totally mind-blowing if you stop and think about them.</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Here are some more examples.</p>


<p><strong>Examples<br /></strong>The latest tablet computer has an incredible camera and loads of other mind-blowing features.</p>

<p>One of the most mind-blowing things about the universe is the distance between the planets.</p>

<p>The battle scenes in the film were amazing. They just blew my mind.</p>


<p><strong>Harry<br /></strong>So, to finish off, I thought I'd give you a mind-blowing fact about space and the universe&#151;Something that will really blow your mind.</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>OK, let's hear it.</p>


<p><strong>Harry<br /></strong>Did you know that every hour, the universe expands by a billion miles in all directions?</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>It gets bigger by one billion miles in all directions?! That is mind-blowing.</p>


<p><strong>Harry<br /></strong>I know&#151;just mind-blowing.</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>I've got a very different one for you about insects&#151;cockroaches.</p>


<p><strong>Harry<br /></strong>Cockroaches? Yuck! What is it?</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Well, Cockroaches can live for several weeks without their heads.</p>


<p><strong>Harry<br /></strong>They can live without their heads?! Well, that's just blown my mind. Join us again for more mind-blowing English on The English We Speak.</p>


<p><strong>Both<br /></strong>Bye!</p>
