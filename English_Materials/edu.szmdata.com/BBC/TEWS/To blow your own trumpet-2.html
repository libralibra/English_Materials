	<tr><td class="roles">William:</td><td> Hello and welcome to The English We Speak. My name is William Kremer.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> And I'm Helen.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">William:</td><td> I've got something for you, Helen.</td></tr>
	<tr><td/><td class="examples">Burst of loud classical music (Beethoven's '5th Symphony')</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> It's nice to have a bit of music William, but why&#160;...&#160;</td></tr>
	<tr><td/><td class="examples">Burst of different classical music (Mendelssohn's 'Dance of the Clowns')</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">William:</td><td> What do you think&#160;... nice music, huh?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> Well, it's certainly dramatic! So are we having a special musical edition today, William?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">William:</td><td> Well, yes we are Helen. The BBC Proms start this Friday, remember?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> Ah, of course. The BBC Proms is a huge classical music festival that the BBC sponsors. It's over 100 years old.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">William:</td><td> Yes and every day for the next two months hundreds of music fans will queue to get their hands on a Â£5 ticket.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> Wow. Are you going to go?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">William:</td><td> No, I hate queuing! But anyway, I thought we could have a music-themed programme. And our phrase this week relates to one instrument in particular&#160;...&#160;</td></tr><p><em>Trumpet music solo</em></p>
<table border="0">
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> The trumpet?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">William:</td><td> Yes, do you know what it means to say someone 'blows his own trumpet'?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> Yes. It means that someone is talking too much about his achievements, right?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">William:</td><td> Exactly. Let's listen to an example.</td></tr><p><em>Woman: Who's going to be there tonight?</em></p><p><em>Man: I think Angela and Mark and that guy Martin&#160;...&#160;</em></p><p><em>Woman: Oh no, not Martin! He's such a bore. He's always blowing his own trumpet. Last time I saw him he went on and on about how he had been promoted twice in six weeks.</em></p><p><em></em></p>
<table border="0">
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> So this is quite a negative phrase then?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">William:</td><td> Yes, sometimes. But interestingly, it isn't <span>always</span> used in a negative way. Listen to this example. A woman is talking to her niece.</td></tr><p><em>Woman: I didn't know you'd come top in the class again! Why didn't you tell me? You really must start blowing your own trumpet a bit more!</em></p><p><em></em></p>
<table border="0">
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> So in that clip, the woman was telling her niece she ought to blow her own trumpet more?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">William:</td><td> Yes. And English people sometimes use this phrase because they are embarrassed to talk about their achievements. Listen to this clip:</td></tr>
	<tr>
		<td/>

			<table border="0" class="examples">
				<tr><td class="roles">Man:</td><td>How's it going at your work nowadays?</td></tr>
				<tr><td class="roles">Woman:</td><td>Well, at the risk of blowing my own trumpet, it's going very well. In fact, I've just won an award!</td></tr>

	</tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> She said "At the risk of blowing my own trumpet".</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">William:</td><td> Yeah, so that's like saying "Excuse me while I talk about my achievements"!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td>Well, I wonder whether <span>we</span> should blow our own trumpet a bit more. I mean here we are with a really popular website, bbclearningenglish.com&#160;...&#160;</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">William:</td><td>&#160;...&#160;yeah, making lots of little programmes that are entertaining, fascinating, useful&#160;...&#160;</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td>&#160;...&#160;and best of all, it's all free! Brilliant, huh?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">William:</td><td> Yeah, that's brilliant! But maybe we should stop blowing our own trumpet now! Shall we have some more of that nice music again to finish off?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> Oh yes! Bye!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">William:</td><td> Bye!</td></tr>
