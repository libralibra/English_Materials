<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>Harry and Feifei talk about a violent sounding expression that actually means a friend has said something against you.</p>
<h3>Transcript</h3>

<p>Note: This is not a word-for-word transcript</p>


<p><strong>Harry<br /></strong>Hello and welcome to The English We Speak! Harry with you here today, and joining me is Feifei.</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Hello everybody! And the expression we are going to look at in this programme is 'stab in the back'. So Harry, how are you?</p>


<p><strong>Harry<br /></strong>[Distracted] What? Oh, not bad. Well&#160;... no, fine. Nothing.</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>What? You're not telling me something. What's the matter? Has something happened?</p>


<p><strong>Harry<br /></strong>No, not really. I'm just annoyed with Jim. I don't really want to talk about it.</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>But I thought you were friends.</p>


<p><strong>Harry<br /></strong>Well, we were friends, until I discovered he stabbed me in the back&hellip;</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Stabbed you in the back?!</p>


<p><strong>Harry<br /></strong>Yes, exactly! He had a meeting with the boss, and right there, he stabbed me in the back! In front of everyone! I'm really annoyed.</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>But, surely you're more than annoyed! I mean, if he stabbed you in the back&#151;don't you need an ambulance at least? I mean, it's lucky he didn't kill you. What did he stab you with? A knife?</p>


<p><strong>Harry<br /></strong>Ah, no. He stabbed me in the back with his words. There was no actual violence.</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>He stabbed you with words?</p>


<p><strong>Harry<br /></strong>Yes. To stab someone in the back means to betray someone. He knew that I wanted to handle the new video project, and he said he'd help me get it. But in the meeting he told the boss that I didn't have enough experience to do a project like that.</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Ah, so stab in the back means he did something bad to you even though you thought you were friends.</p>

<p>Here are some more examples of 'stab in the back'.</p>


<p><strong>INSERT<br /></strong><em>A lot of young people think you have to stab people in the back to get ahead in business, but you don't.</em></p>

<p><em>She told me she was in love with me, but then she stabbed me in the back and went out with Dave.</em></p>

<p><em>I wouldn't trust Laura if I were you. She's nice to your face, but then she stabs you in the back.</em></p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>So, you're not happy with Jim. But personally I'm just relieved. It could have been a lot worse. I mean, you're not actually hurt. Remember sticks and stones may break your bones but words will never hurt you.</p>


<p><strong>Harry<br /></strong>Well, that's an expression for another programme!</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>You're right. Today's expression is to stab someone in the back. Not a very nice thing to do.</p>


<p><strong>Harry<br /></strong>Join us again soon on The English We Speak.</p>
