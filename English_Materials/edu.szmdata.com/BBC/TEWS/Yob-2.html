	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Yobs?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Callum:</td><td> Yes, yobs. Yob is our phrase for today. It's an informal word that refers to a man who is loud and rude and possibly rather violent.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Oh, that sounds like you!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Callum:</td><td> What are you talking about, sounds like me?! What do you mean? Are you asking for a fight?!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> No, no, no! But do you see what I mean? You sound like a yob.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Callum:</td><td> Erm&#160;... yes, OK. Sorry about that. Hmm. Anyway, I chose this word because as many people will know the UK recently experienced some violence on the streets of London and other cities. 'Yob' is a word that the British press used to describe the rioters. Let's hear some real headlines from some British newspapers:</td></tr>
</table>
<ul>
	<li><em>UK</em><em> riots: 11 councils to evict 'riot yobs'.</em></li>
	<li><em>Ken Clarke blames 'feral' yobs.</em></li>
	<li><em>600 riot yobs left DNA on windows.</em></li>
	<li><em>Riot yobs filmed attacking cop cars.</em></li>
	<li><em>Riot yobs can't hide.</em></li>
	<li><em>UK</em><em> riots: young yobs back on streets despite David Cameron's pledge.</em></li>
</ul><p><em></em></p>
<table border="0">
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Ah, I'm not sure I remember seeing this word yob on the BBC news site.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Callum:</td><td> Well no. It's a very negative and judgemental word. The BBC tends to avoid this kind of language in its news stories. But this is a piece of British slang that is very common in the UK. And we also sometimes use the word yobbo.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Yobbo. Hmm. But where do all these words come from?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Callum:</td><td> Well, interestingly, what we have here is an example of backslang. If you read the word yob backwards, what do you get?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Erm&#160;... B.O.Y., boy.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Callum:</td><td> Exactly. And that's what the word used to mean, but now it refers to a rude and violent man, often a young man but not always.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Listen Callum, I'm sorry about earlier. I don't really think you are a yob. You are a gentleman.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Callum:</td><td> Oh, thanks Li.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> But in any case you know if we were to get in a fight I would beat you. So don't you try that again!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Callum:</td><td> OK.</td></tr>
