<table border="0">
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> Hi Chris, I see you've got an interesting new jumper.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Chris:</td><td> Ah, yes. I went to the market this weekend. I wasn't looking for a new jumper but I walked past a vintage clothing stall and this just caught my eye.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> Ow, did it hurt?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Chris:</td><td> No, no. It's just a way of saying it attracted my attention and it made me want to take a closer look. I eventually bought it for only Â£10. What do you think?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> Well, it's OK. But I don't really like the yellow colour with orange sleeves. It's a bit bright.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Chris:</td><td> What do you mean?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> I have to be honest Chris: bright colours don't really suit you.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Chris:</td><td> Oh. Well, it might not be to your taste, but I'm sure other people will like it.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> Jen, what do you think of Chris's outfit today?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Jen:</td><td> Wow, that's an eye-catching jumper! Don't tell me you actually paid for that?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Chris:</td><td> Wh-</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> An eye-catching jumper. So when it catches your eye, you notice it.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Jen:</td><td> That's right, Helen. But eye-catching doesn't necessarily mean it's bright&#151;like Chris's interesting jumper. It can be something that you quickly see because it surprises or interests you.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Chris:</td><td> You can also catch other people's eyes.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> Urgh, I hope no-one throws their eyes at me!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Chris:</td><td> It's a gesture that can be romantic&#151;to catch someone's eye across a crowded room. Let's listen to some examples:</td></tr>
	<tr><td/><td class="examples">Jeff was about to give up and leave when he caught Sophie's eye at the bar.</td></tr>
	<tr><td/><td class="examples">David was impatient to leave the restaurant and raised his hand to catch the waiter's eye.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Chris:</td><td> So you can grab someone else's attention by looking at them with your eyes.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> Hmm. If I see someone I like, should I be polite and ask them if I can catch their eye?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Chris:</td><td> No, it's just something you do when you look at someone. You don't need to ask.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> I'm looking around the room. I'm looking around the room. And now I'm looking at you, Chris. I'm catching your eye.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Chris:</td><td> That's right.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> I'm catching your eye!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Chris:</td><td> Well, it is only temporary. If you look for any longer it can become a stare.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> I've caught your eye!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Chris:</td><td> Yes, yes you have&#160;... OK, you are definitely staring at me now.</td></tr>
