	<tr><td class="roles">Wang&#160;Fei:</td><td> In the first example, the speaker described a party that was ruined because kids crashed the party. So, to crash a party means to gatecrash a party?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">William:</td><td> Yeah. And in that second example, the speaker said that he was going to pay a guy to be on the door.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Wang&#160;Fei:</td><td> 'To be on the door'&#151;so this man will check that everyone who comes in has an invitation. Hmm&#160;... do you think that there might be someone on the door at this party tonight?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">William:</td><td> The one that you’re going to?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Wang&#160;Fei:</td><td> Yes.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">William:</td><td> The celebrity one in Cannes with George and Jack and Tom?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Wang&#160;Fei:</td><td> Yeah.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">William:</td><td> Yeah, I think, Wang Fei, there might be.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Wang&#160;Fei:</td><td> (crestfallen) Ah!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">William:</td><td> Well, I tell you what, Wang Fei, my friend's having a birthday party in the pub down the road. Why don't you come to that instead? You'll be a little bit overdressed but I'm sure it will be fun.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Wang&#160;Fei:</td><td> I was just looking forward to a bit of glamour for a change, with George, Jack and&#160;...&#160;</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">William:</td><td>&#160;...&#160;and Tom, yeah I know. One day, Wang Fei, if you keep making great programmes with BBC Learning English then I’m sure that one day you’ll be mixing it with George and Jack and Tom.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Wang&#160;Fei:</td><td> But for now, I’ll have to be happy with the pub. Again. Bye.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">William:</td><td>Bye!</td></tr>
