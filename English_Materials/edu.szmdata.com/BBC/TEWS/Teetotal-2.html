	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> And I'm Helen. Hello.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">William:</td><td>So, are you going to go out after work tonight, Helen?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> You mean for Rob's birthday? What's the plan?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">William:</td><td> Well, I think we're just going to head to the Fox and Flowerpot at 6.00pm.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> Going to the pub again? No, I think I'll give it a miss this time.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">William:</td><td> Oh no! Why? Have you got plans?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> No, it's just&#160;...&#160;</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">William:</td><td> You don't like Rob, maybe?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> No, no&#151;that's not the reason. I just don't like going to the pub all the time. I don't really drink, you know, and I always feel a bit awkward.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">William:</td><td> Ah, I didn't know you were teetotal, Helen!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> Teetotal?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">William:</td><td> Teetotal. This is an adjective that describes a person who doesn't drink alcohol.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> Right&#151;so does this person just drink tea?!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">William:</td><td> Well maybe! But actually, the word teetotal doesn't have anything to do with tea. It's spelled T.E.E.T.O.T.A.L. Let's listen to this example of the word being used:</td></tr>
	<tr>
		<td/>
		<td>
			<table border="0" class="examples">
				<tr><td class="roles">Man:</td><td>Have you bought the drinks for the party yet?</td></tr>
				<tr><td class="roles">Woman:</td><td>Yep&#151;I've got a case of wine and two boxes of beer. I've also got some soft drinks for Granny. She's teetotal nowadays.</td></tr>
			</table>
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> Can you say, "I don't feel like drinking beer tonight&#160;... I'm going to have a teetotal evening"?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">William:</td><td>Well not really. We describe people as teetotal, and it means that they never drink alcohol. Now, teetotal is an adjective, but there is also a noun that we can use. See if you can hear it in this example:</td></tr><p><em>Man: My father used to drink heavily, you know. Every night he'd have a bottle of Scotch. Maybe that's why I've always been a teetotaller.</em></p>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> I heard the word teetotaller. And the speaker in that clip was describing why he was a teetotaller. Now William, where does this word come from?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">William:</td><td> Well no-one is really sure, Helen. But it's worth saying that in the past it was used to describe someone who didn't drink and who also thought that drinking alcohol was a bad thing. I think nowadays it's a little bit softer.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> Well, truth be told William, I'm not a teetotaller. I like a drink every now and then but I just can't drink pint after pint of beer like you English people!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">William:</td><td> Well, good for you Helen! But why don't you come to the pub anyway? You can just have an orange juice or a lemonade. No-one will laugh at you.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> No, they won't laugh at me, but they will ask me to drive them home! No, please tell Rob happy birthday but I don't feel like it tonight. But thanks for telling us about this interesting word, William.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">William:</td><td> Well, don't mention it, Helen. Right, I'm off to the pub now.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> Don't drink too much!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">William:</td><td> I won't! Bye!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> Bye!</td></tr>
