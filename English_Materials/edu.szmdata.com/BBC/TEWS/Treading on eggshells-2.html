	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Hello and welcome to The English We Speak. I'm Li and with me is Rob. Hi Rob.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Hi Li. It looks like you've been busy.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> I've just picked up some groceries from the local shop, you know&#151;milk, eggs, bread, flour&#151;I'm going to make a cake.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Oh good. So how was Mr Brown, the shopkeeper? Hasn't he just split up with his wife?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> He has. It was tricky in the shop. I didn't want to say anything to him just in case I mentioned his wife. I only said: "Good morning", and he just said: "Is it?"</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Hmm, it sounds like you've been treading on eggshells.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Oh no, the shop was very clean, nothing on the floor&#151;I don't really think he's the sort of person to throw food around!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> No Li&#151;I mean you were trying very hard not to upset him&#151;that's what treading on eggshells means.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Oh! So it's about being nice&#151;it's about being sensitive to the situation?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Yes.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Well, I was very sensitive. But what have eggshells got to do with it?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Well, if there were eggshells on the floor literally you would have to be very careful where you put your feet!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> OK, but this phrase means you are being careful about what you say. Let's hear some examples:</td></tr>
	<tr><td/><td class="examples">I had to be so careful with what I said to my ex-girlfriend. The smallest thing made her angry: it was like treading on eggshells.</td></tr>
	<tr><td/><td class="examples">Ever since my argument with my neighbour about parking, I feel like I've been treading on eggshells.</td></tr>
<ul>
	<li><em>Since my friend's father died, I don't know what to say to him: it's like treading on</em><em>eggshells.</em></li>
</ul>
<table border="0">
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> So, treading on eggshells can be awkward because you don't know what to say and you don't want to offend someone. So Rob, what should I have said to Mr Brown?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> You could have said 'plenty more fish in the sea!'</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> What?!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Or&#160;...&#160;'I didn't like her much anyway'?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Rob, I think that's the opposite of treading on eggshells.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Really? Anyway let me help you with your shopping&#160;... oops (Rob drops the eggs!).</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Rob! You've dropped the eggs all over my kitchen floor.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Now you really will be walking on eggshells!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> That's not funny.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> I didn't like your cakes much anyway.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Both:</td><td> Bye.</td></tr>
