<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>Rob is worried because one of his friends has a problem with saving money because he has an urge to spend it all on pay day. Li has come up with the perfect phrase to describe these type of people. Listen and find out what it is.</p>


<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>Hello everyone, I'm Li. Welcome to the English We Speak. With me today is Rob.</p>


<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Hello everyone.</p>


<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>Rob, you look worried, what's on your mind?</p>


<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Oh, I'm just concerned about a good friend. He's been asking me for advice about saving money.</p>


<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>Well that's very kind of you, but does he have a problem?</p>


<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>He's one of those people that just can't save money. Every time he gets paid he goes out and spends it all.</p>


<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>I've heard of people like that. I'd say that money burns a hole in his pocket.</p>


<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>That's exactly right, money does burn a hole in his pocket. Whenever he has money he has to spend it.</p>


<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>That's the phrase for the English We Speak today. Let's hear some examples of how people use it.</p>


<p><strong>Examples<br /></strong>A: Why have you never got any money?
<br />B: Well, I have a bad habit of spending my money as soon as I get it. Money burns a hole in my pocket.</p>

<p>A: I find saving money so difficult. I like to buy the latest gadgets.
<br />B: The trouble with you is that money burns a hole in your pocket.</p>


<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>I also have a friend who is tempted to spend every penny.</p>


<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Well, the phrase can also be used in a slightly different way.</p>


<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>What way?</p>


<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>If something unexpected costs a lot of money, you can also say 'it's burnt a hole in your pocket'. Let's hear an example.</p>


<p><strong>Example<br /></strong>A: My daughter is getting married next year.</p>

<p>B: Oh that's fantastic news.</p>

<p>A: Yes, it is. But I think the cost of the wedding will burn a hole in my pocket.</p>


<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>You'd better start saving money now for your daughter.</p>


<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Yes, that's right. Well, unless, of course, she marries a rich guy.</p>


<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>Well, fingers crossed. You still look worried Rob. Are you thinking about your friend or your daughter?</p>


<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Oh, I'm thinking about friend. I think he might need professional help.</p>


<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>Or maybe he needs a girlfriend, someone who can stop him spending.</p>


<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>No. I think that will just make him spend even more.</p>


<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>I know, I was only joking. Bye.</p>


<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Bye bye.</p>
