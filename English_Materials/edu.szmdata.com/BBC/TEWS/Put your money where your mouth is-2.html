	<tr><td class="roles">Rosie:</td><td> Hi, I'm Rosie, and this is Li&#160;... Li? Hurry up! Ah, here's the karaoke bar.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Ahhh! Rosie, why is the bar on the top floor? So many stairs&#160;... Help me please. I'm so unfit. I need to start doing more exercise. I'm going to join the gym tomorrow.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rosie:</td><td> Why don't you join the gym today?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> I'll join it tomorrow and then I'll go every single day&#160;... I will. I really will.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rosie:</td><td> Li, you've been saying that for months but you never actually do it!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> This time I will, I promise.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rosie:</td><td> That's what you always say. You need to put your money where your mouth is.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> You want me to put my money where my mouth is? You want me to eat my coins and banknotes? That's disgusting!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rosie:</td><td> No, Li, that's not what I meant. To put your money where your mouth is means to stop just talking about something and to take action!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Ah, so you didn't really want me to put all these coins in my mouth?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rosie:</td><td> No, please don't. I want you to stop talking about joining the gym&#151;and to join it for real! Here are some more examples:
	<tr><td/><td class="examples">A: If we played a game of tennis I would easily win!</td></tr>

<br /><em>B: Why don't you put your money where your mouth is? I challenge you to a game!</em></td></tr>
	<tr><td/><td class="examples">He always talks about how great the charity is&#151;I think he should put his money where his mouth is and donate some money.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> So to put your money where your mouth is means to support your words with actions?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rosie:</td><td> Yes&#151;I think it's a great expression. So many people just talk and talk about doing things and never actually do them!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> So you'd say youâ€™re one of those people who puts their money where their mouth is?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rosie:</td><td> Definitely.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> That's interesting. So the other day you were saying that you love singing&#160;... and here we are in a karaoke bar&#160;...&#160;</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rosie:</td><td> Well yes but&#160;... I'm really terrible actually. And some of our colleagues are here&#151;how embarrassing.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> No excuses! Put your money where your mouth is and sing a karaoke song!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rosie:</td><td> Ohhhh&#160;... OK.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Oh&#151;maybe sometimes it's best NOT to put your money where your mouth is!</td></tr>
