<h3>Transcript</h3>

<p>Note: This is not a word-for-word transcript.</p>

<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Hello and welcome to The English We Speak with me Neil&hellip;</p>

<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>&hellip;and me Li. Hello.</p>

<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>In this programme, we're talking about clothes.</p>

<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>Clothes! Oh My favourite subject in the whole world! I know all the designers, I try different styles&hellip; I love clothes! Let's talk about MY clothes.</p>

<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Well&hellip; actually I thought we should talk about our smalls.</p>

<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>Smalls?! Do you think my clothes are too small for me? Are you calling me fat?</p>

<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>No, Li. You look fine. 'Smalls' is a word we use for underwear.</p>

<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>Smalls. So you are talking about women's knickers and men's underpants, socks, women's bras&hellip;</p>

<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Yes. And we can refer to our underwear as 'smalls' or 'undies'.</p>

<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>Undies. That's easy to remember because it refers to what we wear under our clothes&#151;undies.</p>

<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Two easy words to remember when you talk about underwear. And remember they are always plural.</p>

<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>I see. So you don't say 'one small' or one 'undy'.</p>

<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>No, you don't. Smalls and undies are always used in the plural and they mean underwear. Now let's hear some examples of how these words are used.</p>

<p><strong>Examples<br /></strong>Linda, hurry up or we'll miss the plane! Don't forget to pack your smalls!</p>
<p>Billy, don't walk around the house in your undies. Your granny is coming to visit and she'll be here at any time.</p>

<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Now don't forget that these words for underwear are very informal and British slang.</p>

<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>Well, smalls and undies can look good too, even if not many people will see them.</p>

<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>So you want to talk about fashion now.</p>

<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>Of course. I love fashion! Do you love fashion, Neil?</p>

<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Er&hellip; not so much&hellip;</p>

<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>Come on, Neil. Let's go shopping! I can help you choose the trendiest clothes&hellip; you've got to have a style. Let's go! Come on!</p>

<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Okay.</p>

<p><strong>Both<br /></strong>Bye!</p>
