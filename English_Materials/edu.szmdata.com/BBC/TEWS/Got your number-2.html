<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>What is Feifei up to? She's planning something but Rob thinks he's got her number. Does this mean her telephone number or something else? All will become clear in this programme.</p>
<h3>Transcript</h3>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Hello and welcome to The English We Speak. I'm Feifei&hellip;</p>


<p><strong><span>Rob
<br /></span></strong>&hellip;and I'm Rob.</p>


<p><strong>Feifei</strong>
<br /> Rob&hellip; are you in a rush to go home today?</p>


<p><strong>Rob</strong>
<br /> Err no Feifei. Why, do you want to go for a drink?</p>


<p><strong>Feifei</strong>
<br /> Well sort of. A friend of mine is visiting and I'd like to go for a drink her. You could join us later if you like?</p>


<p><strong>Rob</strong>
<br /> Oh I see! I've got your number!</p>


<p><strong>Feifei</strong>
<br /> Err yes&#151;you have&#151;so you can call me and meet us later. OK?</p>


<p><strong>Rob</strong>
<br /> No&#151;I mean I know what you're trying to do. You want to go to the pub now and leave me to present the rest of this programme?</p>


<p><strong>Feifei</strong>
<br /> Well&hellip;</p>


<p><strong><span>Rob
<br /></span></strong>I know what you're up to! Well you can't go until we've heard some more examples&hellip;</p>


<p><strong><span>Examples<span>
<br /></span></span></strong>So I'll cook and you wash up? Hmm, I've got your number; you're just going to watch TV all evening.</p>

<p>You can't fool me, I've got your number&#151;you're never going to pay me back.</p>

<p>Watch out, he's got your number&#151;he knows what you're up to.</p>


<p><strong><span>Feifei
<br /></span></strong>OK Rob&#151;if you say 'I've got your number' it means you understand what someone it trying to do or why they are behaving in a certain way.</p>


<p><strong><span>Rob
<br /></span></strong>Exactly&#151;it's not about having your telephone number. I knew when you asked me if I was rushing home you were after something.</p>


<p><strong><span>Feifei
<br /></span></strong>What&#151;so I could sneak out early to go for a drink? Honestly, who do you think I am?!</p>


<p><strong><span>Rob
<br /></span></strong>Well it sounded like you were planning something&hellip; but maybe I misunderstood you. You wouldn't leave me here alone, would you, Feifei? Feifei? Feifei? Oh she's gone. Now where did I put her phone number&hellip; Bye.</p>
