	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> No, I was too nervous! But he was saying something about going for some 'nosh' before recording. What does that mean? What is 'nosh'?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> In British English, 'to have some nosh' is a slang phrase which means to have some food or to have a meal. The word 'nosh' literally means 'food' or 'a meal'.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> OK, I see. So he was saying he would go and have some food before recording?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Yes, I believe so. Let's hear some examples on how to use the word 'nosh'.</td></tr>

<ul>
	<li><em>Our canteen serves good nosh.</em></li>
	<li><em>She likes her nosh.</em></li>
	<li><em>Do you fancy a bit of nosh?</em></li>
	<li><em>There was a lot of nosh at the party last night.</em></li>
</ul>
<table border="0">
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> So we can use 'nosh' as a noun, can we use it as a verb as well, Rob?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Yes, we can. If you 'nosh', you eat.</td></tr>

<ul>
	<li><em>I like to nosh when I watch TV.</em></li>

	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td><em> (Getting excited again)</em> Hey Rob, I'm just getting a bit hungry, do you mind finishing the programme? I'm just going to get some nosh from the canteen.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Is that so Feifei? I know why you are getting hungry&#160;...&#160;</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> What do you mean? I'm just hungry. Will be back later, bye&#160;...&#160;</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Errr, hold on&#160;... wait, wait for me, I might join you for some nosh too&#160;...&#160;<em>(talking to himself)</em> I hope Damien is still in the canteen. Don't forget to check out bbclearningenglish.com for more The English We Speak. Bye!</td></tr>
