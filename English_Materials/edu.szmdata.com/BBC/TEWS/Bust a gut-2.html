<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>Neil's wearing a vest, shorts and sweatbands in the recording studio. It's because he's in training for a marathon&#151;but he has less than a month to prepare. He uses an expression that means 'to make a great effort'.</p>
<h3>Transcript</h3>


<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Hello and welcome to The English We Speak. I'm Neil and joining me is Feifei.</p>


<p><strong>Feifei <br /></strong>Hi everyone.</p>


<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>In this programme we have an expression which means 'to make a great effort to achieve something'.</p>


<p><strong>Feifei</strong>
<br /> Neil, why are you wearing that running gear in the studio? I'm not sure that shorts and a vest are appropriate for the workplace! As for those sweatbands&hellip;</p>


<p><strong>Neil</strong>
<br /> Well, Feifei, it's because I'm desperate to get fit. You see, I'm running a marathon at the end of the month and I've barely started training. I'm really going to have to bust a gut to be ready on time.</p>


<p><strong>Feifei</strong>
<br /> Yes, you really do need to start training but surely busting a gut is not going to help!</p>


<p><strong>Neil</strong>
<br /> I'm not going to bust my gut literally! To bust a gut means 'to make a huge effort to achieve something'. Imagine working so hard that your stomach&#151;or gut&#151;actually breaks!</p>


<p><strong>Feifei</strong>
<br /> Urgh! Here are some examples of the expression 'to bust a gut':</p>


<p><strong>Examples<br /></strong>We're going to have to bust a gut to get this report done by tomorrow. We're only half-way through and it's already 7pm.</p>

<p>The problem with today's millionaire footballers is they're not prepared to bust a gut for their national team.</p>

<p>There are train strikes and the traffic is terrible. I had to bust a gut to get here on time today.</p>


<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>To bust a gut&#151;to make a great effort to achieve something.</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>As you can see from the examples, we can use 'to bust a gut' to talk about non-physical activities as well.</p>


<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Yes so come on Feifei. We need to bust a gut to get this programme finished so I can go out for a training run.</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Alright, alright, we're done now&#151;go and bust a gut.</p>


<p><strong>Neil</strong>
<br /> I'm off&#151;bye!</p>
