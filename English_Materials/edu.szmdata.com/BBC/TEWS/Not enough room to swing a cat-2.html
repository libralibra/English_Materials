	<tr><td class="roles">Finn:</td><td> This is flat number five, Li. I'm happy you came along to help me find a nice place to live.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td>Renting a new place is a big step, Finn. This one looks good. Look here. Big windows, lots of light coming in. Isn't it nice?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Finn:</td><td> Yeah. It's good but&#160;...&#160;</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> It's been painted recently. Look, the wooden floor is lovely!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Finn:</td><td> Yes, you're right, it's lovely but&#160;... Li&#160;... there's not enough room to swing a cat!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> A cat? Are you sure? No problem. I saw one outside. I'll be back in a minute.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>&#160;</td><td class="stageDescriptions">(She leaves the room for a few seconds)</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Finn:</td><td> Li, what is this?!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> It's a cat, Finn. I didn't know you liked swinging cats around, but&#160;... well, this cat was just outside and you can try swinging it! Just be gentle with it.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Finn:</td><td>No, Li. I don't swing cats. In English, you use the expression 'there's not enough room to swing a cat' when you want to say a place is much too small.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td>What a relief!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Finn:</td><td> 'Not enough room to swing a cat' is today's expression in The English We Speak. Let's hear some examples of how to use it.</td></tr>

<table border="0">
	<tr><td class="roles">Finn:</td><td> So, not enough room for me in this flat, Li. But thanks for coming with me all the same.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> So what are you going to do, Finn?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Finn:</td><td> I think I'll just move in with my brother.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Is his flat small? Could you&#160;... swing a cat there?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Finn:</td><td> In my brother's house cats rule! He loves furry little animals.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Well, I think this cat might join you there. Let's go, Finn. Bye.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Finn:</td><td> Bye. And no cat was harmed in the recording of this programme. Isn't that right, Tubby?</td></tr>
