<table border="0">
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Hello, I'm Li and welcome to The English We Speak.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> And hello, I'm Rob. Now Li, I need to tell you something. You know John in the office? Well, he's got a new job.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> That's great news. How is he feeling?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Well, obviously, he's over the moon.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> What? John is 'over the moon'? Is he going to be an astronaut?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> No Li! Well, I don't think so. I just mean he's extremely pleased and happy.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Oh I see. I know in the nursery rhyme Hey Diddle Diddle, "the cow jumped over the moon", but I've never heard of a man jumping over the moon, so he must be very, very, very excited.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> It's just a saying Li. He's not actually jumping over the moon. We say it to show that he's so excited that, in theory, he could jump as high as the moon!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> And over it!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Li, do you know how high the moon really is?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> No, but I know it's a long way away.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> It certainly is! Let's hear some more examples of people being over the moon&#160;...&#160;</td></tr>
</table>
<ul>
	<li>When Jane heard she had won the lottery, she was over the moon.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>When he found out he'd passed his exam he was over the moon.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>I can't hide it; I'm over the moon about getting a promotion.</li>
</ul><p>
<br /><strong>Li:</strong> So, being 'over the moon' means being very excited.
<table border="0">
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Of course John is not only over the moon about getting a new job, he's also on cloud nine.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> What? Now he's on cloud nine?! Is he going to be an airline pilot then, or even a bird?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Nothing like that. It's just another way of saying he's very excited and happy about something&#151;he's up on a very high cloud&#151;cloud nine.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> I see.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Here's some more examples&#160;...&#160;</td></tr>
</table>
<ul>
	<li>Julie got married last week and she's been on cloud nine ever since.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>I've never seen Fred so happy; he's been on cloud nine since he passed his exams!</li>
</ul><p>
<br /><strong>Rob:</strong> So now we know what to say about someone who's very excited and happy.
<table border="0">
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Yes, two good phrases. So, come on Rob, if John is not going to be a pilot or an astronaut, what is his new job? Something just as exciting maybe?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> No&#151;he's going to be an accountant.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Oh, boring! Are you sure? Who is that I can see jumping over the moon? Look!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Is it a cow? Is it a bird? Is it a plane?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> No, no, no&#151;it's John&#151;he really is over the moon! And he really is a star!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Come on Li, let's get down to earth and say goodbye to everybody.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Bye! See you next week for more The English We Speak. Rob, I think he got stuck over there!</td></tr>
