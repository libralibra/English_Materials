<h3><strong>Transcript</strong></h3>


<p><strong>Feifei</strong>
<br />Hello and welcome to The English We Speak&#151;I'm Feifei&hellip;</p>


<p><strong>Rob</strong>
<br />And hello, I'm Rob.</p>


<p><strong>Feifei</strong>
<br />Hey Rob, have you seen Finn today?</p>


<p><strong>Rob</strong>
<br />Yes, I saw him just a few moments ago&hellip; same old Finn.</p>


<p><strong>Feifei</strong>
<br />But when I saw him he was very cheerful&hellip; smiling and he was singing too!</p>


<p><strong>Rob</strong>
<br />Nothing wrong with singing at work.</p>


<p><strong>Feifei</strong>
<br />I know&hellip; but he just seems&hellip;</p>


<p><strong>Rob</strong>
<br />Full of the joys of spring?</p>


<p><strong>Feifei</strong>
<br />Full of the joys of spring? Erm, I don't think so&#151;it's winter Rob&#151;cold and wet.</p>


<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>No Feifei! The season might be winter but Finn's behaviour, or his mood, is cheerful and lively&#151;like springtime&#151;you know, bright, sunny, flowers growing, new animals being born, birds flying around&hellip;</p>


<p><strong>Feifei</strong>
<br />Mmm&#160;... that does sound like spring. It's a nice phrase. It means someone is happy?</p>


<p><strong>Rob</strong>
<br />Happy&#151;that's right. Shall we hear some more examples?</p>


<p><strong>Examples</strong>
<br />Emily's full of the joys of spring today&#151;her boyfriend has just asked her to marry him!</p>

<p>Raj seems full of the joys of spring today&#151;he must have some good news about his exam results.</p>

<p>I'm full of the joys of spring today&#151;I've just won &pound;1,000 in the lottery&#151;now, what shall I spend it on?</p>


<p><strong>Feifei</strong>
<br />So if someone is full of the joys of spring they are in a good mood. So Rob, why is Finn in such a good mood?</p>


<p><strong>Rob</strong>
<br />He's happy because he's going on holiday tomorrow&#151;swapping our cold winter for two weeks in the sun, on the beach in Thailand!</p>


<p><strong>Feifei</strong>
<br />Lucky Finn! But hold on Rob&hellip; there's a strike at the airport tomorrow. All flights are cancelled. Does he know that?</p>


<p><strong>Rob</strong>
<br />I don't think so. Shall we tell him?</p>


<p><strong>Feifei</strong>
<br />I don't know. That will make him 'empty of the joys of spring'&hellip;</p>


<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>&hellip;and full of the misery of winter!</p>


<p><strong>Feifei</strong>
<br />Is that another idiom?</p>


<p><strong>Rob</strong>
<br />No, I just made that one up. Come on, I'll go and tell him.</p>


<p><strong>Feifei</strong>
<br />Bye.</p>


<p><strong>Rob</strong>
<br />Bye.</p>
