	<tr><td class="roles">(In the office, people are discussing where they should go for a meal)</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</td><td>OK, everyone it's 6 o'clock, I'm done. I think it's time we go for dinner!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">B:</td><td>I'm starving. Shall we go to Big Eaters? I love their salad&#151;you can go bottomless.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">C:</td><td>I'm not a salad person. How about some fish and chips? Happy Fisher offers bottomless chips.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">D:</td><td>I suggest we go to Happy Chicken across the road. We can go bottomless with any soft drinks. I'm very thirsty.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">A:</td><td> Do we know anywhere that we can go bottomless on the main course?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">D:</td><td>Oh, that can only be your home!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td>Oh my God! Neil, what are you talking about? Are we really going 'bottomless' tonight? I'm afraid I can't go to the restaurant naked.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Neil:</td><td>Oh Li. You have misunderstood the word 'bottomless'.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td>Oh? What does it mean then?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Neil:</td><td>Here it simply means 'unlimited' or 'boundless'&#151;you can have as much food or drink as you like for the same price.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td>Ah, it sounds like a buffet, doesn't it? You can eat as much as you like. Can I say 'I had a bottomless buffet'?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Neil:</td><td> No, it's not a term people say or use, mostly you see it only on the menu in a restaurant.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> I have seen the word 'unlimited', but I've never seen the word 'bottomless'.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Neil:</td><td> Yes. They mean the same thing. Nowadays a lot of restaurants do this to attract customers, but the 'bottomless' only applies to soft drinks. Do you know why?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Because they are cheap! I guess no pubs in the whole of England would offer a bottomless service!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Neil:</td><td>Shame about that! However, there is another common expression you may come across: 'a bottomless pit'. Let's listen to some examples:</td></tr>
	<tr><td/><td class="examples">It's a poor country with a bottomless pit of debt.</td></tr><p><em></em></p>
<ul>
	<li><em>Jack will eat any food that's left over. His stomach is a bottomless pit!</em></li>
</ul>
<table border="0">
	<tr><td class="roles">Neil:</td><td> This expression is used to describe someone or something that always needs or wants more of whatever they are given, especially money.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td>I see. What a vivid expression!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Neil:</td><td>Finally the word 'bottomless' does have another meaning&#151;not wearing trousers.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> See, that's what I thought, going naked. Now that you have explained, I must not make the same mistakes again! Thanks Neil.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Neil:</td><td> You're welcome Li. For more idiomatic expressions just log onto bbclearningenglish.com. Bye!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td>Bye!</td></tr>
