<h3>Transcript</h3>


<p><strong>Feifei</strong>
<br />Hello and welcome to The English We Speak, I'm Feifei&hellip;</p>


<p><strong>Rob</strong>
<br />&hellip; and hello I'm Rob.</p>


<p><strong>Feifei</strong>
<br />Rob, thanks for giving me a lift home from the station tonight.</p>


<p><strong>Rob</strong>
<br />No problem Feifei. Happy to help&hellip; and look we're almost home&hellip; just turn this corner.</p>


<p><strong>Feifei</strong>
<br />Great&#151;I would have got very wet walking home in this rain.</p>


<p><strong>Rob</strong>
<br />That's OK&hellip; but I was wondering if you could do something for me now?</p>


<p><strong>Feifei</strong>
<br />Oh! Rob, did you just give me a lift home so that I would do something for you?</p>


<p><strong>Rob</strong>
<br />Well&hellip; err&hellip; you know what they say&hellip; 'one good turn deserves another'.</p>


<p><strong>Feifei</strong>
<br />'One good turn deserves another'? Are we talking about driving? There's no need to 'turn another corner', we're already at my house.</p>


<p><strong>Rob</strong>
<br />No Feifei&#151;I mean when someone does something to help you, you should do something helpful in return.</p>


<p><strong>Feifei</strong>
<br />Oh, is that right! We had better hear some more examples of this phrase&hellip;</p>


<p><strong>Examples</strong>
<br />A: Do you mind doing the washing up? I did do all the cooking and one good turn does deserve another!
<br />B: Oh, OK then.</p>

<p>Please can you help me with my homework, I did yours last week and you know what they say: one good turn deserves another!</p>

<p>He helped me fix my car, so I was happy to let him borrow it if he needed to&#151;one good turn deserves another.</p>


<p><strong>Feifei</strong>
<br />So one good turn deserves another&#151;do someone a favour and they should return the favour. Hmm, I've been thinking Rob, you're right&#151;you did me a kind favour and I should help you&#151;so how can I help?</p>


<p><strong>Rob</strong>
<br />Well, if you're sure Feifei&#151;I wondered if you could help me paint my house this weekend?</p>


<p><strong>Feifei</strong>
<br />Help you paint your house?</p>


<p><strong>Rob</strong>
<br />Not all of it&#151;just the living room, the kitchen, the bathroom and the bedroom.</p>


<p><strong>Feifei</strong>
<br />That's not fair! Rob, I'm sure one good turn deserves another of equal value&#151;giving me a lift home isn't the same as painting all you house!</p>


<p><strong>Rob</strong>
<br />Oh, so the answer is 'no' then?</p>


<p><strong>Feifei</strong>
<br />No! Bye.</p>


<p><strong>Rob</strong>
<br />Erm&hellip; bye. And you can walk next time!</p>

<p></p>
