	<tr><td class="roles">Kaz:</td><td> Well, it's dramatic, but there's another reason. I thought it could introduce today's expression.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Yang&#160;Li:</td><td> Tell me more.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Kaz:</td><td> The expression is 'It's not rocket science'.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Yang&#160;Li:</td><td> 'It's not rocket science', meaning?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Kaz:</td><td> Something that's not complicated or difficult to understand&#151;'it's not rocket science'.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Yang&#160;Li:</td><td> For example?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Kaz:</td><td> OK. Somebody can't get the television to work and asks you, "How do I switch this thing on?" You would say "It's not rocket science. Just press 'on' on the handset".</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Yang&#160;Li:</td><td> So there's nothing complicated about it. You just press the 'on' switch and away you go. But is the expression 'it's not rocket science' only used for gadgets?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Kaz:</td><td> No, not at all, Li. In fact it's used for many situations that are just obvious&#160;... for example&#151;why are we always short of money?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Yang&#160;Li:</td><td> Well, it's not rocket science Kaz&#151;we don't get paid enough!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Kaz:</td><td> Brilliant Li. That's an excellent example.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Yang&#160;Li:</td><td> Yes, I like it too. But let's listen to some more examples:</td></tr>

	<tr><td class="roles">Yang&#160;Li:</td><td> OK Kaz, the phrase 'it's not rocket science' is used for situations that are obvious. But I get the feeling that the phrase 'it's not rocket science' is quite informal, right?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Kaz:</td><td> You're right Li. So please use with care!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Yang&#160;Li:</td><td> Absolutely.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Kaz:</td><td> It's usually used with the negative 'It's not rocket science'.</td></tr>
