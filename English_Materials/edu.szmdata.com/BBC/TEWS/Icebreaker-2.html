	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Hmm. It is a scary thing to do. What you need is some kind of icebreaker.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Wang&#160;Fei:</td><td> An icebreaker? That sounds quite cold!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Don't worry, it's not. But an icebreaker has got something to do with warming up a cold situation. It will make things more relaxed.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Wang&#160;Fei:</td><td> An icebreaker is something you can do or some words you can say to make people feel relaxed. So an icebreaker will make things less formal?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Yes, that's right. Doing something or saying something at the start will hopefully make your date more relaxed and less tense.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Wang&#160;Fei:</td><td> I see. An icebreaker will make people feel more relaxed. Maybe I should sing a song or do a dance?!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Now that's a bit over the top&#151;why not start with a joke?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Wang&#160;Fei:</td><td> If singing or dancing is a bit over the top, or too much, I will think of a joke then.</td></tr>

	<li>Telling a joke is an excellent icebreaker.</li>
	<li>That party needed an icebreaker to make it less formal!</li>

<table border="0">
	<tr><td class="roles">Wang&#160;Fei:</td><td> So just now we heard people using icebreaker in their conversation. Rob, does icebreaker literally mean breaking the ice?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> It does. You can do it when you start a new job. Everything feels so formal that it's good to break the ice. We British can be a bit reserved or formal so it's good if someone can break the ice.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Wang&#160;Fei:</td><td> Yes, I agree. Sometimes British people can be quite reserved and formal. Rob I'm not good at jokes. Do you have any I can use?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Let's have a think. How about telling this one? "With my last girlfriend it was love at first sight&#151;then I took a second look!"</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Wang&#160;Fei:</td><td> It's a good joke. But honestly, did it work for you?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Um&#160;... It didn't actually. But it might be good for you!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Wang&#160;Fei:</td><td> Hmm&#160;... Actually I think I would rather find a good story on our website as an icebreaker.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Yes. Don't forget our website is a good place to learn some English phrases that might help you break the ice at a party.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Wang&#160;Fei:</td><td> And our website is&#160;...&#160;</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> www.bbclearningenglish.com. Bye bye.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Wang&#160;Fei:</td><td> Bye!</td></tr>
