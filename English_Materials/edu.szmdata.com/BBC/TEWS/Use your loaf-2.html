	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Hello and welcome to The English We Speak with me Rob and a very hungry-looking Li.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> (mouth full of food) Hello.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Erm, Li, you're talking with your mouth full. Can you wait till lunchtime please?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> No I can't&#151;I'm starving.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Well, be careful&#151;you're making such a mess in here.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Ever since I started jogging before work, I just have to eat a big snack mid-morning or I feel faint by lunchtime.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Well, maybe, but you know you're not supposed to eat food in the studio. It's a really bad idea&#151;you could damage the equipment. Oh no&#151;look! There's salad and mayonnaise all over the recording desk! Li, use your loaf!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Use my loaf? Yes, that's a good idea. If I use bread, I can make a sandwich, which will be much tidier.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> No, I mean use your brain&#151;think about things before you do them!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Eh?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Well, in English, if you are slightly annoyed with someone because they are doing something they haven't thought about properly, you can say 'use your loaf'.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Oh I see. Loaf here is slang for head.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> That's right. It's a little old-fashioned but it's still something you might hear. My parents or grandparents would use it for when I did something a bit&#160;... stupid.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Here are some examples.</td></tr>
	<tr>
		<td/>

			<table border="0" class="examples">
				<tr><td class="roles">Old&#160;man:</td><td>Use your loaf, son. Don't ride your bike on the motorway at night without lights. You'll get yourself killed.</td></tr>

</ul>
<table border="0">
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> So, 'use your loaf' means think about things before you do them otherwise you will make silly mistakes.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> That's right. So Li, use your loaf and stop eating food in the studio.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Yes, next time I'll use my loaf and eat sandwiches.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> No, don't eat food of any kind in the studio&#151;not even sandwiches.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> But sandwiches are nice and tidy.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> No they're not. You'll get lots of little crumbs everywhere.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> How about an apple?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> No! Juice might drip!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> A banana?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> No Li&#160;... oh goodness!</td></tr>
