<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>Neil's doing a partner dance on his own in the studio to help you learn English. Learn an expression which means two people need to accept the blame for a bad situation.</p>
<h3>Transcript</h3>


<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>(Tango music playing) Hello and welcome to The English We Speak, I'm Neil and joining me is Feifei&#160;...&#160;</p>


<p><strong>Feifei</strong>
<br /> Hi there. In this programme we've got an expression that means two people are involved in a tricky situation and both must accept blame and responsibility. Neil, what on earth are you doing?</p>


<p><strong>Neil</strong>
<br /> Dancing! (Tango music playing)</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Yes, I can see that but&#160;... on your own. You look pretty ridiculous if you don't mind my saying.</p>


<p><strong>Neil</strong>
<br /> Well, Feifei, that's because it takes two to tango!</p>


<p><strong>Feifei</strong>
<br /> Yes it does take two to tango&#151;and that is our expression for this programme.</p>


<p><strong>Neil</strong>
<br /> But the meaning's not as simple as you might think. Let's listen to some examples and then explain a little more.</p>


<p><strong>Examples<br /></strong>The ref should have sent both players off. I know Smith kicked Cooper but it takes two to tango.</p>

<p>Everyone blames Charlie for their break up but Lizzy was just as bad. It takes two to tango.</p>

<p>They should arrest the dodgy agent as well as the manager. After all it takes two to tango.</p>


<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>So, as you can see, 'It takes two to tango' is used to talk about bad or difficult situations.</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Yes, it's used to say that two people&#151;not just one&#151;are responsible for that bad situation.</p>


<p><strong>Neil</strong>
<br /> (Tango music playing) So, Feifei, won't you join me for this dance?</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>You're not exactly a great dancer, Neil. Though, I have to admit, I'm pretty terrible too.</p>


<p><strong>Neil</strong>
<br /> Who cares?! It takes two to tango!</p>


<p><strong>Feifei</strong>
<br /> Argh! You stepped on my toes!</p>


<p><strong>Neil</strong>
<br /> Sorry!</p>


<p><strong>Both<br /></strong>Bye!</p>
