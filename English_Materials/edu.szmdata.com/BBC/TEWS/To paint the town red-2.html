	<tr><td class="roles">Will:</td><td> Hello! I'm Will. It's Friday night&#151;time to have fun! This is the Burning Swan&#151;my favourite pub. I'm just waiting for Li. Oh there she is. My goodness! What is she wearing this time?</td></tr>

	<tr><td class="roles">Will:</td><td> Hi Li! Nice&#160;... blue overalls!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Thank you, these are new overalls, I bought them especially for tonight.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Will:</td><td> Right. Okay. Li, I don't really follow fashion, but in London at least, denim overalls are really just for builders and painters and carpenters.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Yes! Right, where do we start, Will?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Will:</td><td> Eh? What? What are you doing?</td></tr>

	<tr><td class="roles">Will:</td><td> No! No-one wants it to be red!</td></tr>

	<tr><td class="roles">Will:</td><td> It means that we'll go out and have a really exciting, crazy time. We'll paint the town red&#151;it just means we'll have fun, not actually paint things. Let's listen to some examples.</td></tr>
	<tr><td/><td class="examples">It's my daughter's birthday today. She's gone out with her friends. I expect they'll paint the town red!</td></tr>

	<li><em>We had a crazy night on Saturday, we painted the town red.</em></li>

<br /><strong>Li:</strong>So now, Will, tell me about all this crazy fun we're meant to have. What's your idea of painting the town red?
<table border="0">
	<tr><td class="roles">Will:</td><td> Well we drink, we dance, we laugh loudly, we meet people, we stay up all night.</td></tr>

	<tr><td class="roles">Will:</td><td> No, Li, stop, stop we'll get arrested.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Isn't that colour so much better?</td></tr>
