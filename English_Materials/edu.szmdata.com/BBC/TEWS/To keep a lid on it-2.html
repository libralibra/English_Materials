<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>Li and Neil go for a coffee, but why do they have to keep a lid on it?</p>
<h3>Transcript</h3>
<p>(sound of coffee cup being put on a table)</p>

<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>Thanks for the coffee, Neil. What a good idea to present The English We Speak from a coffee shop!</p>

<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Yes, Li, it's good to get out of the studio&#151;and anyway, I get the coffee for free here.</p>

<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>You don't pay for it?! So why do you get it for free?</p>

<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>(Sounding slightly vague) Contacts.</p>

<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>Err&hellip; contacts?</p>

<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Yes, people I know. Don't tell anyone but my friend works here and&hellip; well&hellip; when the boss isn't around, he gives me the coffee for free.</p>

<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>(loudly and surprised) He gives it to you for free?</p>

<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Ssshhh! Keep your voice down. If he gets found out he'll get the sack&#151;you know, lose his job. We need to keep a lid on it.</p>

<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>Keep a lid on it?! Why do we need to keep a lid on the coffee? Are we trying to hide it?</p>

<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>No Li. When you say <em>keep a lid on something</em>, it means keep it secret&#151;or keep it quiet about it&hellip;</p>

<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>Oh I see.</p>

<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>The phrase can also mean keep something strongly under control. Like your loud voice&#151;control it and don't tell anyone! Keep a lid on it.</p>

<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>We had better hear some examples while I drink my coffee&#160;... quietly!</p>

<p><strong>Examples<br /></strong>We need to keep a lid on the company merger&#151;if the newspapers get to hear about this, our share price will drop.</p>
<p>Our baby is due in November but keep a lid on the news&#151;we haven't told our parents yet.</p>
<p>Please&#151;keep a lid on your emotions&#151;otherwise the waiter is going to ask us to leave!</p>

<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>So that is keeping a lid on something. (sips coffee) Mmm, this coffee does taste good but I don't like the idea that you got it for free&#151;it's dishonest&hellip; I might have to tell someone about this dishonest behaviour.</p>

<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Ah! You mean you're going 'to lift the lid' on what I'm doing&#151;that means to tell someone about something bad&#151;well, you can but you know what that will mean?</p>

<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>What's that?</p>

<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>You'll be buying the coffee next time&#151;and it's not cheap!</p>

<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>Oh right&#151;let's just keep it our little secret for now shall we?</p>

<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>OK Li!</p>

<p><strong>Both<br /></strong>Bye.</p>
