<h3>Transcript</h3>


<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Welcome to The English We Speak: I'm Neil.</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>And I'm Feifei.</p>


<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>You know what, Feifei, I just love living here in London. I mean, the culture, the parks, the restaurants&#151;it's got everything.</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Yeah, it's not bad, though to be fair it's not the cheapest place to live.</p>


<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>You're right. Though most world capital cities are quite pricey to live in, to be fair.</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Actually, to be fair, I think there are a lot of reasons to move out of the big city&#151;you know, more space, better air, fewer people, and&hellip; nature!</p>


<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Feifei, I think we've given good arguments on both sides, to be fair! And I hope we've demonstrated today's phrase&#151;which is: to be fair.</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>It's a phrase you'll hear a lot, especially in British English. It's used when you want to explain more than one side of an issue.</p>


<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Let's listen to these examples:</p>


<p><strong>Examples<br /></strong>We played well in the first half, but to be fair we were awful in the second half.</p>

<p>Now, Luke. We know that wasn't your best exam result, but to be fair, you had very little time to prepare.</p>


<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>So&#151;it's a phrase that we use to give balance in a discussion. And it comes just before or after making a point, or giving an opinion.</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>But these days, especially in spoken English, people sometimes just use it when giving an opinion&#151;whether or not it's really about fairness.</p>


<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Yes, for example: To be fair, The Beatles were the best band of all time.</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>I think Italian food is the finest there is, to be fair.</p>


<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>So be careful when listening out for this phrase&#151;sometimes it's just a 'filler' phrase, something people say a lot with no real meaning. It might not always mean what you expect it to!</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>To be fair, that's why we make these programmes&#151;to help people understand real English.</p>


<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>And they are some of the best English learning materials available, to be fair.</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Though, to be fair, other programmes are available!</p>


<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Bye for now.</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Bye.</p>
