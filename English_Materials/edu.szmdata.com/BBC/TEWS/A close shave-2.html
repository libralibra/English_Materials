<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>Rob is nearly knocked off his bike but he describes his near miss with an expression that confuses Feifei. What has shaving got to do with it? Find out in the programme.</p>
<h3>Transcript</h3>

<p>Note: This is not a word-for-word transcript</p>

<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Hello and welcome to The English We Speak with me Feifei&#160;...&#160;</p>

<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>&#160;...&#160;and me Rob. Hello.</p>

<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Erm, Rob, are you OK? You've got some cuts on your face.</p>

<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Oh well, yes, I've had a bit of a bad morning.</p>

<p><strong>Feifei <br /></strong>I'm sorry to hear that. What happened?</p>

<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>I was cycling into the office and some idiot ran out in the road, right in front of me.</p>

<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Crikey&#151;did you hit him?</p>

<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>No&#151;but it was a close shave.</p>

<p><strong>Feifei</strong>
<br /> A close shave? Did he have a razor?!</p>

<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>No Feifei&#151;that would have hurt. This is an expression that describes a dangerous or unpleasant situation that has only just been avoided. It almost happened&#160;... but it didn't.</p>

<p><strong>Feifei</strong>
<br />Lucky for you! So you're saying you nearly had an accident but you didn't?</p>

<p><strong>Rob</strong>
<br /> Exactly. Let's hear some more examples of this phrase&#160;...&#160;</p>

<p><strong>Examples<br /></strong>We ran to catch the train&#151;it was a close shave but we just managed to get on.</p>
<p>I had a close shave when a fast car just missed me as I was crossing the road.</p>
<p>It was close shave but I don't think my mum saw us smoking.</p>

<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>So, a close shave describes a situation where you have a narrow escape from something bad. So you had a narrow escape this morning Rob?</p>

<p><strong>Rob</strong>
<br /> I did. Why don't people look when they cross the road?! I could have ended up falling off my bike and being hit by a bus.</p>

<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>But hold on Rob&#151;if you didn't fall off your bike, why have you got those cuts on your face?</p>

<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Oh&#160;... these! Well, I had a shave this morning and used a blunt razor.</p>

<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Ouch! So you really did have 'a close shave'!</p>

<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Ha ha. You're as sharp as a razor Feifei! I mean intelligent or sharp-witted.</p>

<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Unlike your razor.</p>

<p><strong>Both<br /></strong>Bye!</p>
