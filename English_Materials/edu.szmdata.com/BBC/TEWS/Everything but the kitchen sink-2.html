	<tr><td class="roles">Neil:</td><td> Hi, Li. The car's outside. Are you ready for our camping trip? Have you packed?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Yes. I'm excited Neil. This is my first camping trip! I have the plastic forks and spoons&#160;... and plates&#160;... and the cups that you told me to get&#160;...&#160;</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Neil:</td><td> Good. I have a couple of pans and a small gas cooker. And I've got the tent and sleeping bags&#160;...&#160;</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Oh Neil, how about my TV? I can't miss my favourite programmes!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Neil:</td><td> A TV?! Well&#160;... OK.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> And&#160;... I can't sleep without my goose feather pillow. Actually, I use two of them.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Neil:</td><td>Pillows? OK&#160;...&#160;</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td>And chairs&#160;... We have to take my comfortable chair. And&#160;... and my lovely soft rug.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Neil:</td><td>A rug?! What?! You want to take everything but the kitchen sink!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Oh, the sink? I might need a sink, Neil, but I think it might be difficult to move it. Unless I try to&#160;... well, I could call a plumber&#160;...&#160;</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Neil:</td><td>No plumber, Li! We're not taking a plumber camping! In English, when we say 'take everything but the kitchen sink', we mean: take far more things than we need.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td>Ah. So you think I might be taking far more things than necessary.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Neil:</td><td> Yes, Li. 'Everything but the kitchen sink' is the expression in this edition of The English We Speak. Now let's hear some examples of how it is used.</td></tr>
	<tr><td/><td class="examples">When Emma went on holiday to Greece, she took everything but the kitchen sink</em><em>. She had to pay a lot extra at the airport!</td></tr>
	<tr><td/><td class="examples">Peter went to London for the weekend with a huge bag of things&#151;clothes, computers, his special shampoo&#160;... He really took everything but the kitchen sink!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Oh. No sink then. I think I'm ready to go Neil.</td></tr>
	<tr><td/><td class="examples">(A sudden clap of thunder)</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Neil:</td><td> Oh, no!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> What is it?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Neil:</td><td> A storm is coming! That's not great for camping. I think this trip will have to wait, Li.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td>No problem. We can go camping another time. Why don't you enjoy my comfortable chair?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Neil:</td><td>Oh, let me just sit down here. Mmm&#160;... it is quite comfortable, isn't it?<strong></strong></td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td>Who needs camping after all! You watch some TV while I go and wash some dishes in my nice and shiny&#160;... kitchen sink. Bye.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Neil:</td><td> Bye.</td></tr>
