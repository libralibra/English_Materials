<h3>Transcript</h3>


<p><strong><span>Neil
<br /></span></strong><span>Hello. I'm Neil. In this programme, we're going to talk about movies. Now, what kind of movies do you like, Feifei?</span></p>


<p><strong><span>Feifei
<br /></span></strong><span>I love romcoms, Neil! 'Romcom' is a word which takes the first two halves of the words 'romantic' and 'comedy'. And what about you, Neil, what sort of movies do you like the most?</span></p>


<p><strong><span>Neil
<br /></span></strong><span>Well, I can't resist a 'whodunnit'. 'Whodunnit' is short for 'who has done it'. The point of these films is for the audience to try to guess who committed a serious crime&#151;usually murder.</span></p>


<p><strong><span>Feifei
<br /></span></strong><span>Ah, you like detective movies! In a 'whodunnit' you can try to beat the detective and work out who committed the crime. That's the fun of it! Sherlock Holmes is a perfect example.</span></p>


<p><strong><span>Neil
<br /></span></strong><span>Yes, 'romcom' and 'whodunnit' are today's expressions in The English We Speak. And&#160;... there's one more. See if you can guess this one now Feifei: 'Hello. I'm a robot sent from the future to prevent war and destruction!'</span></p>

<p><span><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>A sci-fi movie! 'Sci-fi is a word which takes the first two halves of the words 'science' and 'fiction.' These films usually feature robots, aliens and inventions from the future. I love sci-fi too. But sometimes it's scary!</span></p>


<p><strong><span>Neil
<br /></span></strong><span>Well, there's no need to be scared of BBC Learning English&#151;because we explain everything to you so clearly. Let's hear some examples of today's three movie-related expressions.</span></p>


<p><strong><span>Examples</span></strong></p>

<p><em>My favourite <strong>sci-fi</strong> movie is Star Wars. I can't wait for the next film in the series!</em></p>

<p><em>I'm catching a movie with my friends after work. We're going to watch the latest <strong>romcom</strong>.</em></p>

<p><em>Alfred Hitchcock was the master of the <strong>whodunnit</strong>. Nobody makes better films in that genre than he did!</em></p>


<p><strong><span>Feifei
<br /></span></strong><span>That's it! I am fetching the popcorn!</span></p>


<p><strong><span>Neil
<br /></span></strong><span>And I'm going to get some drinks!</span></p>


<p><strong><span>Feifei
<br /></span></strong><span>Let's catch a movie! A sci-fi?</span></p>


<p><strong><span>Neil
<br /></span></strong><span>Yes, indeed! We're going to catch a movie&hellip; I am a robot who came from the future to catch a movie with you, Feifei.</span></p>


<p><strong><span>Feifei
<br /></span></strong><span>You deserve an Oscar! Let's go! Bye!</span></p>


<p><strong><span>Neil
<br /></span></strong><span>Bye!</span></p>
