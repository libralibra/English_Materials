<p class="storyTitle">Chew the fat</p>
<p>(At the coffee shop)
<table border="0">
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Hello and welcome to The English We Speak. Hi, Feifei. I saved this table for us. This is my favourite coffee shop.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> Hi, Rob. Thanks for inviting me to have breakfast with you. It's nice to have the first meal of the day in the company of a colleague before going to the office.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Yes, indeed. Let's chew the fat.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> Ah, you won't catch me this time! I know what you mean by 'chew the fat'!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Every language has some expressions that have a literal meaning and a figurative one. I'm glad you've heard this one before.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> In English, the expression 'chew the fat' means to talk in a friendly way, socially, without actually exchanging too much serious information. Maybe gossip a bit&#160;...&#160;</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Yes. It's a casual conversation, like the one we might have now, over breakfast.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> But first, let's hear some examples of how to use the expression 'chew the fat'.</td></tr>
</table>
<ul>
	<li>I don't want arguments at the dinner table! Let's not talk about football or politics&#151;letâ€™s just chew the fat about other things.</li>
	<li>Mary left the company two years ago but she's always around chewing the fat with her old colleagues.</li>
</ul>
<table border="0">
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> So now you know what 'chew the fat' means. Let's enjoy some fat. I took the liberty of ordering some food for you&#151;and it's on its way now.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Waitress:</td><td> And here you have two plates of your typical English breakfast, as you ordered, sir.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Thank you. Mmmmm&#151;that smells delicious! Come on, Feifei, tuck in while it's still hot.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> Oh Rob. It looks nice but it's a lot of food. Fried egg, cooked mushrooms, half a tomato, a lot of bacon&#160;...&#160;
<br />Rob: Yes. It is our typical fry-up.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> I like eggs and tomato but&#160;... there's a lot of fat here.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Come on, just chew the fat! It's very cold outside and there's nothing like a hearty meal to start the day full of energy.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> Well, it is really cold and the meal smells nice. Maybe eating a bit of fat occasionally won't make me&#160;... well&#160;... fat.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Come on, let's chew the fat. I've heard that John hired a new secretary. He's got one already so why does he need two?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> I know. And she doesn't have much to do anyway&#160;... Mmmmm&#160;... this bacon is really crispy. Let's chew the fat. Bye.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Bye. Mmmmm. Glorious greasy food! Mmmmm&#160;...&#160;</td></tr>
