<table border="0">
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> Hello and welcome to The English We Speak. I'm Helen and with me is Rob. Hi Rob</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Hi Helen. How was your weekend?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> Good thanks, I didn't do much, just relaxed. How was yours?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Interesting. I bumped into Bob&#160;...&#160;</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> Bob? Oh the guy we used to work with.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Yes, that's him. Well, I had a good chat with him. You know all he talked about was computers and how he could never get a girlfriend&#160;... well guess what?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> He's now head of IT?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> No!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> He's won the lottery and is a millionaire?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> No Helen. He's getting married!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> Oh that's good news. Is he marrying anyone we know?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Yes. That's the thing&#151;it's someone we know really well.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> Who's that?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Hmm&#160;... erm&#160;... I can't remember her name&#160;... it's on the tip of my tongue.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> The tip of your tongue? That's a strange place&#151;well ok, stick your tongue out.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> (with his tongue out) Why do I need to do this Helen?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> You said it was 'on the tip of your tongue'.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> No Helen. I mean I know her name but I can't quite remember it right now.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> Why didn't you say! But Rob, will you remember the information soon?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Yes I will. It really is just on the tip of my tongue. Let's hear some examples and her name might come back to me.</td></tr>
	<tr><td/><td class="examples">We nearly won the quiz; John had the answer to the last question on the tip of his tongue&#151;but the other team said it first.</td></tr>
	<tr><td/><td class="examples">The name will come to me soon, it's on the tip of my tongue&#160;... ah yes, his name is Paul.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> So if something is on 'the tip of your tongue', it means there is some information you can't quite remember, but hopefully will soon. So Rob, is the name of the woman that Bob is marrying, still on the tip of your tongue?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> No. I remember it now&#151;her name is Alison.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> Alison&#151;from accounts? That's great news.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> It is and Bob says we're invited to the wedding.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> Brilliant. I love a good wedding&#151;when is it?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Oh, erm&#160;... errr&#160;...&#160;</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> Don't tell me. It's on the tip of your tongue.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> It is&#160;... sorry. I'll remember soon.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> I hope you do.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Both:</td><td> Bye.</td></tr>
