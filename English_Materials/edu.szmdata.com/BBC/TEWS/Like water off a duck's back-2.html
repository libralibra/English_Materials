<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Feifei is upset because her mother-in-law is always criticising her. She goes to the park with Finn, who gives her some good advice. Listen to the programme to find out what this is.</p><h3>Transcript</h3>
<p>(Feifei and Finn are in the park feeding the ducks.)</p>
<p><strong>Feifei<br clear="none"></strong>It's so nice to be here in the park, Finn.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br clear="none"></strong>Yes, it is Feifei. I love coming here and feeding the ducks.</p>
<p><strong>Feifei<br clear="none"></strong>Being here helps take my mind off things. I had a fight with my mother-in-law yesterday.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br clear="none"></strong>What was it about?</p>
<p><strong>Feifei<br clear="none"></strong>Well, she is always criticising everything I do. Last night it was my cooking!</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br clear="none"></strong>Well, don't take too much notice of it, Feifei. My mother-in-law is the same. But it's just like water off a duck's back to me.</p>
<p><strong>Feifei<br clear="none"></strong>A duck's back?!</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br clear="none"></strong>Yes, in English the phrase 'water off a duck's back' means that criticisms or negative things have no effect on you&#151;they're just like water off a duck's back&#151;we don't let them upset or affect us.</p>
<p><strong>Feifei<br clear="none"></strong>What an unusual expression!</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br clear="none"></strong>Yes, it is but, you know, it makes sense. Look at those ducks in the water&#160;...&#160;</p>
<p><strong>Feifei<br clear="none"></strong>Ah, I get it! They have oily feathers and water can't get through them&#151;it doesn't affect them&#151;so I shouldn't let the criticism affect me and make me upset.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br clear="none"></strong>That's right. And the phrase 'water off a duck's back' is what we're teaching today in The English We Speak. Now, let's listen to some examples of how it's used.</p>
<p><strong>Examples</strong></p><p>I won't give up on my singing career just because someone said I'm no good. Criticism is water off a duck's back to me!</p><p>I told John not to drive so fast but it was like water off a duck's back. Last week he crashed his new car. Thankfully nobody was hurt.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br clear="none"></strong>Feifei, which dish was it that you cooked that your mother-in-law didn't like? I'm making dinner tonight and I need a recipe&#160;...&#160;</p>
<p><strong>Feifei<br clear="none"></strong>Well, this is probably not the place to mention it&#160;...&#160;</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br clear="none"></strong>Oh, I'm intrigued. Can't you tell me?</p>
<p><strong>Feifei<br clear="none"></strong>I cooked Peking Duck. You'll need pancakes, spring onions, a nice juicy roast duck&#160;...&#160;</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br clear="none"></strong>Oh, the ducks are not happy!</p>
<p><strong>Feifei<br clear="none"></strong>I don't think they like my recipe at all. Let's go Finn. I can give you a good chicken recipe instead.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br clear="none"></strong>I'd like that. My mother-in-law is coming for dinner too. Bye.</p>
<p><strong>Feifei<br clear="none"></strong>Bye.</p>
