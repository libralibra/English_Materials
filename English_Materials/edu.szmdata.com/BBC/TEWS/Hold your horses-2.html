<table border="0">
	<tr><td class="roles">William:</td><td> Hello and welcome to The English We Speak. My name is William Kremer.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> And I'm Li. William, what's our phrase today?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">William:</td><td>Well, hold on a second Li, let me just play you -</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> No, come on, tell me now&#151;what phrase are we looking at today?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">William:</td><td> Well, we'll come onto that in a minute but I've got some very special FX for you&#160;...&#160;</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> More special FX?! And special music? That's not what our people want! They want authentic English phrases, and they want them now! So what's our phrase today?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">William:</td><td> Li, hold your horses!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Eh?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">William:</td><td> Hold your horses. It means: be patient.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Oh&#160;... where does this phrase come from, William?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">William:</td><td> Well, apparently it comes from battles in times of war:</td></tr>
	<tr><td/><td class="examples">FX&#151;Battle re-enactment noise</td></tr>
	<tr>
		<td/>

			<table border="0" class="examples">

	</tr>
	<tr><td/><td class="examples">FX&#151;gunfire, horses whinnying</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Wow, Will, your FX this week are really special!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">William:</td><td> Hmmm, I know! In that clip we heard a soldier telling his men to hold their horses before he started firing weapons.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> But nowadays, I am guessing, you don't need to be a soldier to use this phrase, right?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">William:</td><td> Exactly, yes. It means: don't rush, be patient. Let's hear a couple of examples:</td></tr><p><em>Man: I've just gone online to order us some new computers. What's our charge code again?</em></p><p><em>Woman: Ah, well you're going to have to hold your horses! I haven't agreed a budget yet with the management team.</em></p><p><em>Man 2: I've just spoken to Mark&#151;</em></p><p><em>Woman 2: Have you indeed? Well don't listen to a word that man says! He's never liked me&#160;...&#160;</em></p><p><em>Man 2: Hey, hey hey! Hold your horses. We didn't discuss you at all, as a matter of fact.</em></p>
<table border="0">
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> So in that first example, the man couldn't order his computers yet because the company hadn't agreed a budget. He had to wait; he had to hold his horses.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">William:</td><td> Hmm. And in the second example it was slightly different. In that clip we heard a woman interrupt the man because she thought she knew what he was going to say.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Ah yes, the man told her to hold her horse and wait for him to finish speaking.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">William:</td><td> Ah, yeah, but Li we never say "Hold your horse" we always say "Hold your horses".</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Oh OK, I'll bear it in mind. But, er, Will&#160;...&#160;?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">William:</td><td> Yeah?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Can you hold this for me please?</td></tr>
	<tr><td/><td class="examples">Horse whinnying</td></tr>
</table>
