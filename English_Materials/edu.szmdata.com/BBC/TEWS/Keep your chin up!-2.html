<p><em>(Rob visits Vera in hospital)</em></p>
<table border="0">
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td>So, how are you feeling, Vera?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Vera:</td><td> Thank you for visiting me here in hospital, Rob. I feel awful! My leg is broken, my chin is bruised and my pride is hurt! I had a silly fall while I was skiing over the weekend.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Oh, bad luck, really. But your leg will heal and your bruises will disappear soon, Vera. There will be no sign of them in a few weeks' time.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Vera:</td><td> Yes, I know Rob. But now I'm in pain! I'm in pain!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td>But you'll get better, Vera. Just keep your chin up!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Vera:</td><td> Keep my chin up?! (<em>Talking to herself</em>) Keep my chin up might be a new form of treatment&#160;... Rob has always been very knowledgeable of these alternative medicines and treatments. Perhaps it is good for circulation. (<em>To him</em>) Is it good for circulation, Rob?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> No Vera, it doesn't help your circulation! Keep your chin up but&#160;... well, what are you doing? That's not what I mean!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Vera:</td><td> It's not what you mean?! My chin is up now. Isn't it high enough? Will it help my bruises disappear, Rob?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Not really. But it will make you feel better, Vera.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Vera:</td><td> How come, Rob?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> In English, when we tell someone to keep their chin up, we are telling them to stay positive in a tough situation. Let's listen to some examples.</td></tr>
</table>
<ul>
	<li><em>"When young people say it is difficult to earn a living nowadays, I tell them to work hard, keep their chin up and they will go places."</em></li>
	<li><em>"I've just had an argument with my husband. My daughter said she wants to leave school and my cat ran away. I feel like crying. Sometimes it is hard to keep my chin up."</em></li>
</ul>
<table border="0">
	<tr><td class="roles">Vera:</td><td> Ah, I've got it&#151;when you want to tell someone to remain positive in a tough situation, you say "keep your chin up!" That's a relief, Rob. My chin was feeling even more painful than it was before.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Well, you can relax now. And next time you go to some slope for some skiing make sure you stay on the nursery slopes.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Vera:</td><td> Nursery?! But that's where children do their skiing! That's for kids!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td>No, not just for kids, Vera&#160;... for beginners too! Anyway, don't be angry! Keep your chin up! With a lot of training, one day you will be a great skier.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Vera:</td><td> Yes, maybe you are right. If I keep my chin up and train a lot, one day I will be a great skier!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Good. Well, bye for now.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Vera:</td><td> Bye.</td></tr>
