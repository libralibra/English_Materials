<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>Rob is annoyed. He has spent hours filling in forms for his small house extension. Can Feifei help him? Listen to the programme to find out.</p>
<h3>Transcript</h3>

<p>Note: This is not a word-for-word transcript.</p>

<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Hello Rob. You look so busy, what are all these papers?</p>

<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Oh, Feifei, I have to get a permit to build an extension to my house. It's a very small bit of building work but I have to fill in all these forms.</p>

<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>What is this one for?</p>

<p><strong>Rob <br /></strong>Well, this one here is for my local council. I need to apply for planning permission. And then they want lots of supporting documents to make sure it fits in with building regulations.</p>

<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>It sounds exhausting.</p>

<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>It is. I hate red tape. If I could cut through this red tape it would be brilliant!</p>

<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>So your problem is red tape? Say no more, Rob! The solution is in my bag! Ah, here they are!</p>

<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>A pair of scissors and blue tape?</p>

<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Yes. You use the scissors to cut through your red tape and&#160;... if you don't like red tape, use blue. I love the colour blue!</p>

<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Thank you, Feifei. You're a good friend. But in English we call the rules and processes required to get official permits&#151;which usually seem to be pointless&#151;'red tape'.</p>

<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Ah, bureaucracy! So let's hear some examples of how this expression is used.</p>

<p><strong>Examples<br /></strong>Small firms won't be subject to new regulations under a government plan to cut red tape and boost the economy.</p>
<p>Andrea almost gave up studying abroad. The amount of red tape to get a visa was unbelievable!</p>

<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>I think most people hate bureaucracy, Rob.</p>

<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>I'm not surprised. Some people say this expression might come from the 16th century, when bundles of documents were held together with red tape. I hate all these forms!</p>

<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Well, it's the 21st century now and we still have red tape. Good luck with your red tape, Rob. I'm off to paint the town red!</p>

<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Oh, no more idioms with red for me today please.</p>

<p><strong>Both</strong>
<br /> Bye.</p>
