	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Well, since today's words are stuff and stuffed, I think you will be just perfect to explain them.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Neil:</td><td> Oh that's easy. I knew I was going to a launch party this lunchtime, so I skipped breakfast.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> That's not good.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Neil:</td><td> Anyway, I got there and a lovely buffet was set up. The stuff on offer looked great.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Stuff? You mean the food?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Neil:</td><td> Yes. The word 'stuff' can mean anything really. It almost has the same meaning as 'things'. Let's hear these people:</td></tr>

	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Well, we hear the word stuff used a lot in conversations. People say it all the time. My stuff, your stuff, his stuff. All referring to things.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Neil:</td><td> Yes. You can also use it like a verb: I stuffed myself with food.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> You are stuffed? Completely full?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Neil:</td><td> Yes, I am completely stuffed, I can barely move.</td></tr>

	<tr><td class="roles">Neil:</td><td> I can't stand them. They are stuffed full of wool or cotton or something. They are for girls; I much prefer proper wooden toys.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Maybe you'd prefer a wooden pillow too?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Neil:</td><td> Are you joking! I've got to have a nice and soft pillow. But I must make sure it has the right stuffing in it?</td></tr>

	<tr><td class="roles">Neil:</td><td> Anything but feather or duck down.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Why?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Neil:</td><td> Allergies. I can't stand anything stuffed with feathers.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> I think we've talked long enough about stuff you eat for lunch, stuff that you liked and stuff that gives you allergies.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Neil:</td><td> Well, it's time for you to get your stuff ready for Sunday Roast.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> That's right. Join us next time. Bye bye!</td></tr>
