<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>Feifei and Harry discuss a new purchase that has revolutionised Harry's life.</p>
<h3>Transcript</h3>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Hello and welcome to The English We Speak. I'm Feifei and joining me is Harry.</p>


<p><strong>Harry<br /></strong>Hello there! And the popular modern expression we are going to look at in this programme is 'game changer'.</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Game changer. We'll look at what it means and when you can use it. So Harry&#151;did you end up buying a new TV like you were planning?</p>


<p><strong>Harry<br /></strong>I certainly did&#151;and then some! I don't know if 'TV' is really the right word for it though.</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Why not?</p>


<p><strong>Harry<br /></strong>Well, it's so much more. It's got a 72-inch curved screen with ultimate high-definition and it's 3D. When you watch a programme, it's like you're really there.</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Wow&#151;it sounds amazing.</p>


<p><strong>Harry<br /></strong>It is! TV will never be the same again. In TV terms, it's a real game changer.</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>A game changer? What's that?</p>


<p><strong>Harry<br /></strong>Well, it's so unlike any normal TV, that it's changed the rules of what TVs are. You will never think of TV in the same way if you watch my TV&#151;it's a new world of television.</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>So 'game changer' means something that is so new and different, it changes the rules of the game.</p>


<p><strong>Harry<br /></strong>Exactly. It could be technology, like my TV, or a person with new ideas, or a new direction in music or fashion. Any new innovation that changes the current situation.</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>I see. Let's listen to some examples:</p>


<p><strong>Examples<br /></strong>The Beatles' album Sergeant Pepper was a real game changer&#151;it transformed pop music forever.</p>

<p>Our company needs a game changer&#151;someone who can come in and rethink the way we do everything.</p>

<p>Last year my boss said we could all work from home whenever we needed to. It's been a real game changer in the way we work.</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>So, some different types of game changers there. For people learning English, I suppose the internet has been a real game changer. You can study anytime, anywhere now.</p>


<p><strong>Harry<br /></strong>You can&#151;especially if you visit our website <a href="http://www.bbclearningenglish.com/">bbclearningenglish.com</a>.</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Very true, if you want to improve you English, our website can be a real game changer. So, I suppose you're going to be staying in tonight.</p>


<p><strong>Harry<br /></strong>Me? No, I'm going out.</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>But, you've got an amazing new TV, the game changer.</p>


<p><strong>Harry<br /></strong>I know, but it's Thursday, and there's never anything good on TV on Thursdays. And to be honest, I think I've been watching too much TV. I need to get out more.</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Oh well&#151;I guess your TV didn't change the game for long. Join us again for more The English We Speak.</p>


<p><strong>Both<br /></strong>Bye!</p>

<p></p>
