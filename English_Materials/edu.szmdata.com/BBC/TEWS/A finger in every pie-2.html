<table border="0">
	<tr><td class="roles">Rosie:</td><td> Hi and welcome to The English We Speak. Today we're having an office party with the whole BBC Learning English team.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> And we're eating some delicious cakes and pies that Jen has baked for us. Have you tried the apple tart?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rosie:</td><td> Mmm&#160;... It's so tasty. Jen really has a lot of different skills, doesn't she?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> Yeah, she really gets involved in lots of different activities. She's always organising different parties, goes rowing&#160;... and did you know she works as a weather presenter at the weekend?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rosie:</td><td> And she's a good cook too&#151;this blueberry crumble is delicious. She really does have a finger in every pie.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> Ugh, really? I mean they taste good, but now I know she puts her fingers in them&#160;... I think I've just lost my appetite.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rosie:</td><td> That's not what I meant when I said she has a finger in every pie. It means she gets involved in a lot of different things.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> So someone has a finger in every pie when they're involved in different activities? Is it a good thing then?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rosie:</td><td> Well, in this case, when I said Jen has a finger in every pie, I meant it as a good thing, but it can sometimes suggest someone gets involved in things when they shouldn't.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> So it can be a good or a bad thing&#160;... Let's have a look at some examples:</td></tr>
</table>
<ul>
	<li><em>If you need any information just ask Annabel. She has a finger in every pie and always knows the answer.</em></li>
	<li><em>At work I'm a teacher but I also do some accounting and organise the end-of-term play. I like to have a finger in every pie!</em></li>
	<li><em>"I can't seem to do anything without him being there&#151;yesterday I went to the photography club and he was there." "Well, unfortunately he does have a finger in every pie."</em></li>
</ul>
<table border="0">
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> So if someone gets involved in too many different things and people disapprove of this, it can be used as a criticism.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rosie:</td><td> Yes, and Shakespeare used it in his play Henry VIII. In the play it's used as a criticism of someone who gets involved in everything when he shouldn't:
	<tr><td/><td class="examples">No man's pie is freed</td></tr>

<br /><em>From his ambitious finger.</em></td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> So the person criticised here feels the need to put his 'ambitious finger' in every single pie that's baked to taste them all&#160;...&#160;</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rosie:</td><td> Yes, which means he gets involved in things he shouldn't.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> But Shakespeare used the expression in a slightly different way from how we use it today. Now we just say someone has a finger in every pie.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rosie:</td><td> Yes, it's slightly less poetic than "no man's pie is freed from his ambitious finger".</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> Well, this is all very interesting, but I haven't tried the peach pie yet&#160;...&#160;</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rosie:</td><td> Well, no pie is freed from Helen's greedy fingers, is it? Only joking, Helen!</td></tr>
