<p align="left"><strong><span>Rob
<br /></span></strong>Welcome to The English We Speak with me Rob and &hellip;. oh&hellip; oh&hellip; Feifei&hellip; Feifei, where are you?</p>


<p><strong>Feifei</strong>
<br />Hi&hellip; hi&hellip; over here&hellip; come quickly.</p>


<p><strong>Rob</strong>
<br />Oh&hellip; oh&hellip; what seems to be the problem?</p>


<p><strong>Feifei</strong>
<br />I think there's been a murder!</p>


<p><strong>Rob</strong>
<br />What?! Really&#151;a murder, here? How can you be so sure?</p>


<p><strong>Feifei</strong>
<br />Well, last night I was speaking to my friend and we were talking about Jenny from our office&hellip;</p>


<p><strong>Rob</strong>
<br />Oh yes Jenny, I haven't seen her around for a while &hellip; so?</p>


<p><strong>Feifei</strong>
<br />My friend said Jenny has probably met someone, got married and moved to Australia&#151;but then she said something very strange, she said it was 'a stab in the dark'.</p>


<p><strong>Rob</strong>
<br />'A stab in the dark'? Ha&#151;so you think she's been murdered?</p>


<p><strong>Feifei</strong>
<br />Well possibly&#151;she hasn't been seen for a long time and then someone was stabbed&#151;and in the dark&#151;so she must have been murdered at night. Oh dear, I think we should call the police!</p>


<p><strong>Rob</strong>
<br />No, don't call them yet. That phrase isn't as bad as you think. There's not been a murder. When you say you are 'taking a stab in the dark' it means you don't really know the truth and you are just guessing.</p>


<p><strong>Feifei</strong>
<br />Really? Oh phew. That is good news.</p>


<p><strong>Rob</strong>
<br />Ok. Let's hear the phrase in action&hellip;</p>


<p><strong>Examples</strong>
<br /><em>It might be a stab in the dark but I think my football team is in a good place to win the league this season.</em></p>

<p><em>I don't know how many people came to see the show, but I'll take a stab in the dark and say about 300.</em></p>

<p><em>John thought we could sell our old car for &pound;500&#151;but really he was taking a stab in the dark!</em></p>


<p><strong>Feifei</strong>
<br />So the phrase 'to take a stab in the dark' does not involve stabbing people! But Rob, if we're not sure what did happen to Jenny, it's still a bit of mystery.</p>


<p><strong>Rob</strong>
<br />Well maybe she didn't move to Australia&hellip; maybe she just got a new job&hellip; but I'm just taking a shot in the dark.</p>


<p><strong>Feifei</strong>
<br />A shot in the dark! Now you're talking about her being shot in the dark?</p>


<p><strong>Rob</strong>
<br />No no no no&#151;a shot&#151;or a stab in the dark means the same thing&#151;it means I'm guessing&#151;I don't really know.</p>


<p><strong>Feifei</strong>
<br />Well guess no longer&#151;look, here she comes!</p>


<p><strong>Jenny</strong>
<br />Hello you two.</p>


<p><strong>Rob</strong>
<br />Jenny!</p>


<p><strong>Jenny</strong>
<br />Why are you looking so worried&#151;has someone died?!!</p>


<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Bye!</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Bye bye!</p>
