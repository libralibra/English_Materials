<p>(Finn and Feifei on a visit to the zoo)
<table border="0">
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> Hi. I'm Feifei and joining us here today in the zoo to present The English We Speak is Finn.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Finn:</td><td> Hi.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> What's the matter, Finn? You sound worried. The zoo is a place of fun.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Finn:</td><td> Yes, and I love animals too. But I don't know what I'm going to do with that white elephant.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> That one over there?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Finn:</td><td> No. The one my uncle is giving me.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> Your uncle is giving you an elephant?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Finn:</td><td> Yeah, he is moving to South Africa and he's giving away some of his things.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> And are you ready to take care of an elephant?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Finn:</td><td> That's the problem. I'm not. It is beautiful&#160;...&#160;</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> Oh yes, I'm sure it is!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Finn:</td><td>&#160;...&#160;and it is powerful&#160;...&#160;</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> Yes, very powerful!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Finn:</td><td> But it needs too much petrol!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> Petrol?!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Finn:</td><td> Yes. Old sports cars need a lot of petrol, you know.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> That's a relief. You're talking about a car.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Finn:</td><td> Of course! I wasn't talking about an actual elephant.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> The elephant sounds relieved too.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Finn:</td><td> Yes, he does. In English, when you call something a 'white elephant' you mean that it's large, costs a lot of money to keep and has no useful purpose.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> A sports car is useful.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Finn:</td><td> Not for me. I am a cyclist and I love my bicycle. Listen to some examples of how to use this expression.</td></tr>
	<tr><td/><td class="examples">I've paid a lot of money for this posh designer dress that I never use. It is a white elephant!</td></tr>
	<tr><td/><td class="examples">The new airport is a white elephant! It's got four runways and it's equipped with the latest technology, but not many people visit this region.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> Oh. So a 'white elephant' is something that might look good but in reality it's a waste of space.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Finn:</td><td> Yes, it is.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> Unlike these elephants we have here in the zoo. They seem to be very popular.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Finn:</td><td> Shall we go and have a look, Feifei?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> Indeed and they're grey, not white!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Finn:</td><td> Bye.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> Bye.</td></tr>
