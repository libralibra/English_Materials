<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>Sian is amused because Feifei is looking for a stamp to post her letter. Why doesn't she just send an email? In this programme you'll learn an adjective that describes people or things that seem old-fashioned.</p>
<h3>Transcript</h3>


<p><strong>Sian <br /></strong>Hello and welcome to The English We Speak from BBC Learning English. I'm Sian.</p>


<p><strong>Feifei</strong>
<br /> Hi everyone, I'm Feifei.</p>


<p><strong>Sian<br /></strong>What on earth are you looking for Feifei? Why are you taking everything out of your bag?</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>I'm just looking for a stamp&#151;I know I've got one in here somewhere. I just can't seem to find it.</p>


<p><strong>Sian<br /></strong>A stamp? What do you want a stamp for?</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>I've written a letter to my family and I want to get it in the post before midday.</p>


<p><strong>Sian<br /></strong>You've written a letter? That's a bit old-school isn't it?</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>'Old-school'? Who are you calling 'old-school'? I'm younger than you!</p>


<p><strong>Sian<br /></strong>Yeah but writing letters is quite old-school, you know&#151;it's a bit old-fashioned. Most people just email or send instant messages nowadays.</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Yeah, but it's so nice to get a real letter in the post! So 'old-school' basically describes something that's from an earlier time&#151;something old-fashioned. Let's hear some examples:</p>


<p><strong>Examples<br /></strong>Woah! That haircut is so old-school!</p>

<p>You want to go roller-skating tonight? Man, that's so old-school!</p>

<p>Our new teacher is a bit old-school in his approach, but he always gets good results.</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>So 'old-school' is used as a bit of an insult, right?</p>


<p><strong>Sian<br /></strong>No, it doesn't have to be. It can also be used a compliment&#151;to talk about something from the past that you admire. Or to describe something you feel nostalgic about.</p>


<p><strong>Examples<br /></strong>I love your new coat&#151;it's so old-school!</p>

<p>Look at these old-school computer games, aren't they awesome?!</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Exactly, I think it's a good thing to be old-school. If only I could find that stamp.</p>


<p><strong>Sian<br /></strong>Why don't you just fax it?</p>


<p><strong>Feifei</strong>
<br /> Well, that really would be old-school Sian. Get with the times!</p>
