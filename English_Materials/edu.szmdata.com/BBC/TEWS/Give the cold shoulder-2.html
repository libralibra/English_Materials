<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>Feifei thinks she has a solution to her former friend Lisa's cold shoulder. But Rob wonders if Feifei's expensive designer shawl will warm Lisa's heart. Listen to the programme to find out more.</p>
<h3>Transcript</h3>

<p>Note: This is not a word-for-word transcript.</p>


<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Hi Feifei. What a beautiful woollen shawl you're wearing! But it looks far too elegant to use for just another day in the office&hellip;</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>I know, Rob. I wanted to give it to Lisa, now that she's got that promotion&hellip;</p>


<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Really? But she's hardly even said hello to you since her promotion and you used to be friends&hellip;</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>I know. She's been giving me the cold shoulder. That's why I brought this woollen shawl for her.</p>


<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Feifei, you do know there's a difference between Lisa's shoulders being cold because it's winter and her 'giving you the cold shoulder', don't you? You can't just warm her shoulders and be friends again.</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Yes, I do. In English, someone giving you the cold shoulder means they're behaving in a way that is not friendly at all and they're doing it for no obvious reason.</p>


<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Yes. It means they are rejecting you or ignoring you. And 'give the cold shoulder' is today's expression in The English We Speak.</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Let's hear some examples.</p>


<p><strong>Examples<br /></strong>After Mary divorced her rich husband all their friends gave her the cold shoulder. She was not invited to their lavish parties anymore.</p>

<p>My brother told our parents I haven't been studying at all and my marks are low. I'm not happy and I've been giving him the cold shoulder. Let's see if he's got the message.</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Rob, I know what giving someone the cold shoulder means, but even so I think this shawl might help me get Lisa to change how she's acting.</p>


<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>How come?</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Well, Lisa loves fashion and designer clothes. As soon as she sees me with this lovely shawl, she'll be impressed and stop ignoring me. She won't think she's better than me anymore!</p>


<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Well, and if you lend it to her, she might not feel cold anymore&hellip; it's been rather cold in the last few weeks&#160;...&#160;</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Yes. This woollen shawl will stop her having cold shoulders and might even stop her giving me the cold shoulder. How about that?</p>


<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Now that is a clever use of the English language!</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Bye.</p>


<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Bye bye.</p>
