<h3><strong>Transcript</strong></h3>


<p><strong>Helen<br /></strong>Hello and welcome to The English We Speak. I'm Helen and joining me today is Rob.</p>


<p><strong>Rob</strong>
<br />Hello. Hey, have you heard Neil's good news?</p>


<p><strong>Helen</strong>
<br />No, what's that?</p>


<p><strong>Rob</strong>
<br />Well, he ran in the London Marathon and he came first!</p>


<p><strong>Helen</strong>
<br />That's impossible.</p>


<p><strong>Rob</strong>
<br />Well I know it's hard to believe but he has been training very hard and he's quite a fast runner.</p>


<p><strong>Helen</strong>
<br />Sorry Rob&#151;he's lying through his teeth&#151;he went to the cinema on Sunday!</p>


<p><strong>Rob</strong>
<br />Oh, did he really? Well, you've just used a perfect phrase&#151;'to lie through your teeth'&#151;it means to tell someone something that's completely untrue.</p>


<p><strong>Helen</strong>
<br />That's why I said it! So he's giving you false information.</p>


<p><strong>Rob</strong>
<br />Yes, I'm going to have words with him&#151;but before I do, let's hear some more examples of this phrase&hellip;</p>


<p><strong>Examples</strong>
<br />When she said she was nearly 30 years old, I knew she was lying through her teeth!</p>

<p>They promised we'd get free drinks every day at our hotel but they were lying through their teeth.</p>

<p>He lied through his teeth when he said he bought her an expensive engagement ring&#151;it was just a cheap one from the catalogue.</p>


<p><strong>Helen</strong>
<br />So, 'to lie through your teeth' means to say something that's false. Neil was telling an outrageous lie, I can't believe you fell for it.</p>


<p><strong>Rob</strong>
<br />Well actually, it was me who was lying through my teeth. Neil didn't tell me he'd won the marathon&#151;it was a trick to find out where Neil really was on Sunday&#151;and now you've told me&#151;he was at the cinema on his own! Thanks very much.</p>


<p><strong>Helen</strong>
<br />Well, to be honest, he wasn't alone at the cinema&#151;he went with me but we forgot to invite you. Sorry!</p>


<p><strong>Rob</strong>
<br />You liar!</p>


<p><strong>Helen</strong>
<br />It was just a little white lie&#151;a lie that's told just to avoid upsetting someone.</p>


<p><strong>Rob</strong>
<br />Well it hasn't worked. I'm off. Good bye!</p>


<p><strong>Helen</strong>
<br />Oh dear, Rob.</p>
