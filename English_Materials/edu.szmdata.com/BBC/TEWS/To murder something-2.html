<p class="storyTitle">To murder something</p>
<table border="0">
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td>Hi Helen. I thought I would pop round to talk to you about today's Authentic Real English but&#160;... err&#160;... it looks like you're busy&#160;... what are all these police cars doing here?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> Quick, come in, shut the door&#160;...&#160;
<br />&#160;...&#160;now this is very serious. There has been a murder.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> What?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> A murder! I know it's not very nice&#160;... but to be honest the police can't find any blood or a body. It's like a murder mystery.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Hmm, we need to do our own investigation. So what exactly happened?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> Well, my friend came to see me this morning.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> I see.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> And we were having a nice chat when she said I could murder a coffee and then she disappeared and I haven't heard from her since.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Right. Well Helen, relax, I think she's still alive and everything is ok.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> There's no murder?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> No murder. When people say they could murder something it's an informal way of saying they are starving or thirsty and are desperate to have something to eat or drink.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> But murder is a strong word.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Yes. It stresses how desperate someone is for something. A direct translation would mean you are so desperate for something you would kill it! But in reality, we don't go that far.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> Thank goodness!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Here are some more examples:</td></tr>
	<tr><td/><td class="examples">It's been a really tough day at work, I could murder a beer or two&#151;anyone want to join me at the pub?</td></tr>
	<tr><td/><td class="examples">I'm starving, I could murder a curry.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> It's amazing what people will commit murder for!! But in reality when we would murder for something, we just have a desperate need for something.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> People also describe a situation or a feeling as murder&#151;but again there is no killing involved&#151;they are just trying to explain that something is bad or uncomfortable.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> So the word murder is also used to emphasise a bad situation or uncomfortable feeling. Such as Rob?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Such as in these examples:</td></tr>
	<tr><td/><td class="examples">Running a marathon is murder on my knees.</td></tr>
	<tr><td/><td class="examples">I've been decorating all day and my back is murder.</td></tr>
<ul>
	<li><em>Don't go on the London underground during the rush hour, it's murder!</em></li>
</ul>
<table border="0">
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> So by saying 'it's murder' he means it's awful; it's terrible. Anyway Helen, now we know there's not been a real murder, I think we should tell these policemen to go home now.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> Good idea. Excuse me&#160;... there's been a terrible misunderstanding. There's not been a murder so you can all go home.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Policeman:</td><td> Oh right. So we've been wasting our time then? But hold on&#160;... I think there might be another murder soon.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> Oh, why's that?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Policeman:</td><td> Well, I could murder a cup of tea!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> Of course.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> I'll put the kettle on.</td></tr>
</table>

<br />
<br /><strong>Helen &amp; Rob:</strong> Bye.
<table border="0">
	<tr><td class="roles">Policeman:</td><td> Milk, two sugars please!</td></tr>
