<br />Rob:</strong> Mmm, saying get lost is quite impolite so you need to be careful how you say it and who you say it to. Maybe I was a bit rude to Helen. Helen, Helen, come back&#160;... I didn't mean to be so rude.

	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td>&#160;...&#160;well you weren't being very nice. Anyway, I was going to come back and find you.</td></tr>

	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> OK Rob. See you next time.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Both:</td><td> Bye.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Right, it's definitely this way.</td></tr>
