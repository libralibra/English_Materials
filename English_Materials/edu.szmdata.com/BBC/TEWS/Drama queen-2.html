<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>Feifei is in the studio and Callum is nowhere to be seen. The clock is ticking. Where is he? There he is, with a shopping bag. Oh dear, he's been shopping without a care in the world. Feifei is very angry but&hellip; will her anger last? Listen to the programme to find out.</p>
<h3>Transcript</h3>

<p><strong>Callum<br /></strong>Oh, hello, Feifei. Already here to present The English We Speak.</p>

<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>What do you mean by 'already here', Callum?! And what are all these bags you have with you?</p>

<p><strong>Callum<br /></strong>Shopping.</p>

<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Shopping?! I'm here in the studio, waiting for you and you went shopping?! This is absurd.</p>

<p><strong>Callum<br /></strong>Oh, come on, Feifei, we still have a couple of minutes to go. Don't be such a drama queen!</p>

<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Drama queen?!</p>

<p><strong>Callum<br /></strong>Yes, drama queen! We say someone is a drama queen when he or she becomes very angry or upset over tiny small things like&hellip;</p>

<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>&hellip; like you being late&hellip;</p>

<p><strong>Callum<br /></strong>Not late&#151;shopping. Now, let's hear some examples of how the expression 'drama queen' is used.</p>

<p><strong>Examples<br /></strong>A: Oh, it's raining and my new hairdo is ruined! All those hours in the hairdresser for nothing!
<br />B: Don't be such a drama queen. Here, take my umbrella.</p>
<p>I'm not dining out with Peter anymore. If the dish is not cooked exactly the way he likes he makes a big fuss. He's such a drama queen!</p>

<p><strong>Callum<br /></strong>That's it, Feifei. And now, here, in my bag&hellip;</p>

<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>What, now you're going to sort out your shopping?</p>

<p><strong>Callum<br /></strong>This is for you, Feifei!</p>

<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Oh, a present for me?! Oh&hellip; you shouldn't have&hellip;</p>

<p><strong>Callum<br /></strong>You didn't want people to know it's your birthday, but&hellip; well, happy birthday, Feifei!</p>

<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Ohhh! I don't know what to say&hellip; I guess I'll have to take back my words. Thank you, Callum. You know what? We can make the programme a bit later. Let's celebrate!</p>

<p><strong>Callum<br /></strong>OK.</p>

<p><strong>Both<br /></strong>Bye!</p>
