<table border="0">
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> Hi Finn. I'm so happy. I finally bought that laptop I was so keen on.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Finn:</td><td> That's great, Feifei. It took you a long time to decide on the brand, the model&#160;... and even the colour, didn't it?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> Yes, I know. But there are so many options on the market&#160;... Every computer has its good and bad points, but I followed your advice!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Finn:</td><td> My advice?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> Yes, your very good advice! Let me take the laptop out of the bag and show you&#160;...&#160;</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Finn:</td><td>Bells?!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td>Yes, bells! Aren't they lovely?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Finn:</td><td> And what on earth are those?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> Those are whistles!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> And this one, too.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Finn:</td><td>Feifei, the laptop is a good one. This is the latest model of a very good brand&#160;...&#160;</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> Yes, it is! And you told me to buy one with all the bells and whistles!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Finn:</td><td>Yes, but when I said that, I didn't mean actual bells and whistles. In English, when you say 'bells and whistles', you mean something extra, like all the add-ons and gadgets.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td>No whistles? And no bells?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Finn:</td><td>I'm afraid not. 'Bells and whistles' is today's expression in The English We Speak. Let's hear some examples of how it's used.</td></tr>
	<tr><td/><td class="examples">My neighbour is very jealous of me. I've just bought a car with all the bells and whistles! It's even got a mug holder for my coffee by the dashboard!</td></tr>
	<tr><td/><td class="examples">I don't need a mobile phone with the latest bells and whistles. They add to the cost and all I do is answer calls and send text messages.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> Well, even if you didn't mean actual bells and whistles, Finn, you gave me good advice.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Finn:</td><td> Oh? How come?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> When I left the shop, with my brand new laptop, a mugger tried to steal it from me.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Finn:</td><td> Oh, that's terrible, Feifei!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> Yes, I know. But I managed to unzip my bag, shook the laptop and blew the whistle. A policeman who was nearby heard the noise; he rushed over and arrested the mugger!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Finn:</td><td> Oh, that's brilliant! Well, maybe I should attach some bells and whistles to my laptop, too.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td>Yes. A computer with all the bells and whistles is great, I say!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Finn:</td><td> OK. Bye.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td>Bye.</td></tr>
