	<tr><td class="roles">William:</td><td> Oh right. What's that?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> What was that word you used just now, William? Hulla&#160;...&#160;?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">William:</td><td> Hullabaloo.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td>Oh, that's it.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">William:</td><td>Hullabaloo. You spell it H.U.L.L.A.B.A.L.O.O. Hullabaloo. It means a loud noise or commotion.</p><p></td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Hullabaloo (wrong pronunciation).</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">William:</td><td>Hullabaloo.</p><p></td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td>Hullabaloo (correct pronunciation).</p><p></td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">William:</td><td>Exactly, yeah.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Let's hear another example of this word being used.</td></tr>
	<tr><td/><td class="examples">I tried to quieten the class down, but there was such a hullabaloo that no-one could hear me!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td>So in that example, a teacher's class was making such a hullabaloo that no-one could hear her. Is this word used in any other ways, William?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">William:</td><td> Well, the word hullabaloo can imply anger and disapproval. Can you imagine lots of people shouting because they're angry? Have a listen to this example:</td></tr>
	<tr><td/><td class="examples">That actor was so angry with the film's director and producer that he refused to do any promotional work. But then when he didn't go to the premiere in L.A., there was such a hullabaloo from his fans that he had to apologise.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> So in that example, a film star didn't go to a premiere and there was a hullabaloo from his fans because they were angry with him.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">William:</td><td> And in that situation, 'hullabaloo' doesn't mean lots of loud noise, but maybe some angry blog articles and some harsh words in the press.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td>William, I must say, 'hullabaloo' is a very strange sounding word! Where does it come from?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">William:</td><td> Well, no-one really knows for sure. But some people think it comes from people going "Hullo! Hullo! Hullo!"</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Really? That's very&#151;</td></tr>
	<tr><td/><td class="examples">Shouting and banging starts again.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Oh, our own hullabaloo has started again!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">William:</td><td> Right. I'm going to see what they want!</td></tr>
	<tr><td/><td class="examples">Gets up and opens studio door.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">William:</td><td>What's all this noise? We're trying to record a programme here!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Fan&#160;1:</td><td>Is Yang Li here?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Hello, yes? Who is it?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Fan&#160;1:</td><td>Yes! She is, she is!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Fan&#160;2:</td><td>Oh brilliant! Hi Li! Hi!</p><p></td></tr>

	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td>Oh well, I&#160;...&#160;</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">William:</td><td> Oh Li, I didn't know that you had a fan club! Well, I think we'd better end the programme there! Goodbye!</p><p></td></tr>
