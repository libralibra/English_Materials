<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>Rob and Feifei are in the office. He's been busy deleting some emails. Feifei is curious to know what they are. Listen to the programme to find out.</p>
<h3>Transcript</h3>


<p><strong>Rob <br clear="none" /></strong>Delete! Delete! Delete!</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br clear="none" /></strong>Rob? Why are you so annoyed? And what are you deleting.</p>


<p><strong>Rob<br clear="none" /></strong>Can't you see, Feifei? I'm checking and deleting my emails and &hellip; all this phishing!</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br clear="none" /></strong>I thought you liked fishing, Rob. You always show us pictures of all the big fish you've caught.</p>


<p><strong>Rob<br clear="none" /></strong>No. Fishing with an 'F' is good but phishing with a 'ph' is not!</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br clear="none" /></strong>So you're deleting all the 'ph's? All the spelling mistakes?</p>


<p><strong>Rob<br clear="none" /></strong>It's not a spelling mistake. Phishing&#151;with 'ph'&#151;is one of those words that's become popular as we use the internet more and more. It's the name of a particular kind of fraud on the internet.</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br clear="none" /></strong>Fraud?</p>


<p><strong>Rob<br clear="none" /></strong>Yes. It's what we say when someone sends you an email pretending to be a reputable company or person hoping you'll respond and give them your personal information. They want things like your bank account number, password, that kind of thing.</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br clear="none" /></strong>Oh! So the email is a bait!</p>


<p><strong>Rob<br clear="none" /></strong>Yes, exactly. 'Phishing' with 'ph' is today's expression in The English We Speak. Let's hear some examples of how it's used.</p>


<p><strong>Examples<br clear="none" /></strong><em>Our bank never sends emails to clients asking them to reply to a message confirming their password. I'm afraid you've been a victim of phishing, sir.</em></p>

<p><em>I've just received an email informing me that I won the lottery. They want my bank details to deposit the prize. But I've never entered the lottery. This must be phishing!</em></p>


<p><strong>Rob<br clear="none" /></strong>So now you know what kind of phishing I was talking about!</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br clear="none" /></strong>Yes. They wanted your bank details, but we're not taking their bait, are we?<strong></strong></p>


<p><strong>Rob<br clear="none" /></strong>No, we're not. Definitely not!</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br clear="none" /></strong>Hmmm, I think I have some of these phishing emails in my inbox too.</p>


<p><strong>Rob<br clear="none" /></strong>So let's get rid of them all! Come on!</p>


<p><strong>Both<br clear="none" /></strong>Delete! Delete! Delete! Bye!</p>


<p><strong>Rob<br clear="none" /></strong>Delete!</p>
