<h3>Transcript</h3>
<p>Note: This is not a word-for-word transcript.</p>

<p><strong>Helen<br /></strong>Hello welcome to The English We Speak, I'm Helen.</p>

<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Hello everyone. I'm Neil. It's great to be here today, Helen.</p>

<p><strong>Helen<br /></strong>You are very cheerful today.</p>

<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>I feel pretty good, I walked from the train station to the office and it seems to have really energised me.</p>
<p>(phone rings)</p>

<p><strong>Helen<br /></strong>That's my phone. Hello, hello? Anyone there? Hello?</p>

<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Oh, it looks like you may be out of juice.</p>

<p><strong>Helen<br /></strong>What? I am not drinking any juice, but my phone has just gone dead.</p>

<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>That's what I mean. Your phone isn't working because it's out of juice.</p>

<p><strong>Helen<br /></strong>Please explain: what's juice got to do with my phone?</p>

<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>When you've used all the battery power of something like a mobile phone, so that it doesn't work anymore, we can say it's 'out of juice'. It's a slang expression. Have a listen to these examples:</p>

<p><strong>Examples<br /></strong>My laptop's out of juice. This is so frustrating.</p>
<p>I am packing three spare phone batteries so I don't run out of juice on my climbing trip.</p>

<p><strong>Helen<br /></strong>I see. Can we use it for anything else apart from batteries?</p>

<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Sure, sometimes if a person feels low on energy, they could say 'I'm out of juice'. Also if your car is low on petrol, you could say 'The car's running out of juice.'</p>

<p><strong>Helen<br /></strong>Thanks for explaining this phrase. Now I'm feeling quite thirsty&#151;a glass of juice would be most welcome.</p>

<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Let's go and get some then. Meanwhile, charge your phone, so it's got plenty of juice.</p>

<p><strong>Helen<br /></strong>Will do.</p>

<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>See you next time.</p>

<p><strong>Both<br /></strong>Bye!</p>
