<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>Sian is running late for the show, because she has just got back from her summer holiday to find hundreds of emails in her inbox. She has a strange expression about 'sheds' to emphasise this huge number. Find out what it is in the programme.</p>
<h3>Transcript</h3>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Hello and welcome to The English We Speak. I'm Feifei and joining me is Sian. If she ever arrives. Where is she?</p>


<p><strong>Sian<br /></strong>Hi everyone. Sorry I'm late Feifei.</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>That's OK, you're here now. How was your trip to France?</p>


<p><strong>Sian<br /></strong>The holiday was lovely thanks&#151;but it's not so great being back! I've returned to a shedload of emails. That's why I'm so late.</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>A 'what' load of emails?&#151;did you forget how to speak English on your holiday Sian!?</p>


<p><strong>Sian<br /></strong>Of course not! 'A shedload' just means 'a lot'. So, 'a shedload of something' is 'a very large amount or number of something'.</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Hmmm, so I can say 'I've got shedloads of money'?</p>


<p><strong>Sian<br /></strong>Yes&#151;that's right. Lucky you! We can also use the singular form 'a shedload', as in 'you've got a shedload of money'. Let's hear some more examples.</p>


<p><strong>Examples<br /></strong>Jim gets paid shedloads of money, so don't worry, I'm sure he can afford it.</p>

<p>We don't need to go out for dinner tonight; we've got a shedload of food in the fridge!</p>


<p><strong>Sian<br /></strong>We can also use 'shedload' or 'shedloads' without 'of' if it's clear what we're talking about. Like in these examples.</p>


<p><strong>Examples<br /></strong>He spent shedloads on his new car.</p>

<p>I can't go anywhere. I've got shedloads to do today.</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Great, so shall we go and get some lunch now?</p>


<p><strong>Sian<br /></strong>I told you I've got all those emails to get through.</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Yes&#151;but you've got shedloads of time! There's no rush.</p>


<p><strong>Sian<br /></strong>OK, but as you've got shedloads of money, you're paying!</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>I didn't say that.</p>


<p><strong>Sian<br /></strong>Yes you did, you said it a few minutes ago&#151;we all heard you!</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>But it was just an example&hellip; Oh never mind. Come on&#151;lunch is on me!</p>
