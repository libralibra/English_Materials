	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> Rob, I like your trainers, very cool&#160;... and look at your designer jeans. Trendy! Rob's looking quite trendy today&#151;for a change!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> So you like them then?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> I do but&#160;... it's not really what someone your age normally wears.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> I see. But don't you think it makes me look cool and fashionable and&#160;... younger?</td></tr>

	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> So Rob, to do this you have to dress like a teenager?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Not just that. I share the same interests as young people. I listen to their music on my mp3 player. Like this.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> Could you turn that down please! So you're acting young when really you aren't! It seems getting down with the kids is about behaving like them. Well, you are certainly a big kid Rob! Let's hear some examples of people using this phrase.</td></tr>
	<tr><td/><td class="examples">My Dad's bought a new skateboard so that he can be down with the kids!</td></tr>

	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> So Rob, what else are you doing to be down with the kids?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Hey Helen, doing things like chillin' and being where it's at.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> Rob not all kids talk like that.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Oh right. Well, I've got some rollerblades so I can blade round the park. The only trouble is&#160;... I can't seem to get them on&#160;... Ouch, my back!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> Are you OK? It looks like Rob has a bad back, so he won't be down with the kids for a while! Do you need some help?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Thanks. I think I'll just put my slippers on&#151;much more comfortable.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> Remember, being down with the kids can be hard work. See you next time. Bye bye!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Bye. Ouch, my back! Helen, could you just put that slipper over there please? Thanks!</td></tr>
