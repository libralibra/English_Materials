<p>Note: This is not a word-for-word transcript</p>

<p><strong>Yang Li</strong>
<br />Hello and welcome to the English We Speak from BBC Learning English. I'm Li. Neil&#160;... Hey, where is Neil? Although he's great presenter he's often late. Oh, here he comes!</p>

<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Sorry, sorry Li, I'm here now. Sorry, I'm a bit late.</p>

<p><strong>Yang Li</strong>
<br />Wow Neil, you look so different today: a suit and tie&#151;what's happening?</p>

<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Well, I have to present our video: 'The Perfect English Gentleman' it's called.</p>

<p><strong>Yang Li</strong>
<br />That sounds fun. Don't you want to do it?</p>

<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Not really.</p>

<p><strong>Yang Li</strong>
<br />Why not? You are a great presenter. Everyone loves your voice.</p>

<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Well, it's not my voice that's the problem. Look at this massive, broken nose and spotty skin, my missing teeth, and long greasy hair&#160;... Li, I'm pretty ugly. I kept saying to my boss that I have a face for radio, but he insisted I present the video. What can I do?</p>

<p><strong>Yang Li</strong>
<br />Did you say you have a face for radio? But you don't need to show your face as a radio presenter, do you?</p>

<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>That's exactly the point, Li. If you say someone's got a good face for radio, it's an indirect way of saying they are not very good looking!</p>

<p><strong>Yang Li</strong>
<br />I see. I like this phrase 'a face for radio'&#151;an indirect way of saying someone is not very attractive. Here are some examples:</p>

<p><strong>Examples</strong>
<br />Man: Jane looked beautiful at her wedding.
<br />Woman: Really? She must have had a good make-up artist because, to be honest, she's got a face for radio.</p>
<p>Man: No one's going to choose me at this speed-dating event.
<br />Woman: Why on earth not? You're such a warm-hearted guy.
<br />Man: Thanks. But you have to admit, I've got a face for radio.</p>

<p><strong>Yang Li</strong>
<br />So that's 'a face for radio'&#151;our expression today. Hey Neil, I think I have got a solution for your video presenting problem&#160;... How about this for a good opening line? Do you want to hear it?</p>

<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Go on then.</p>

<p><strong>Yang Li</strong>
<br />(clearing her throat): 'This modern English gentleman has got a face for radio. Just shut your eyes, relax and listen&#160;...&#160;'</p>

<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Now you're making fun of me, Li!</p>

<p><strong>Yang Li</strong>
<br />OK, seriously, I think you will be just as good on video as you are in front of a microphone. You have a unique way of saying things which is clear, funny and engaging. What face could beat that!</p>

<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Thanks Li. I feel a lot more confident now! Just pass me that mirror&#160;... Actually I'm not that bad looking, am I?</p>

<p><strong>Yang Li</strong>
<br />No, you're not. You've got a face for TV and a voice for radio!</p>

<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Hey, thanks Li, you've made my day!</p>

<p><strong>Both</strong>
<br />Bye!</p>
