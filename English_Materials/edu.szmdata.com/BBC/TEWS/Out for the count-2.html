<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Neil shares his weekend experience with Li and shows her how a boxing expression can be used to describe his kids.</p>

<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Hello and welcome to The English We Speak. I'm Neil and joining me today is Li.</p>

<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>Hello everyone. The expression that Neil and I will talk about today is "out for the count".</p>

<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>This expression comes from the sport of boxing and describes a boxer who has been knocked unconscious who can't stand up within a count of ten seconds. The boxer is said to be "out for the count" and loses the match. But the expression can also be used in another way&#160;...&#160;</p>

<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>Oh, how?</p>

<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Well, I had a really active weekend. I went hiking in Wales with my wife and our two children.</p>

<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>Hiking in Wales, that sounds like hard work.</p>

<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Well not to my kids. They loved it, they were racing each other, running up and down the hills&hellip;then we went to the zoo where they had more fun.</p>

<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>So you had a nice day out then?</p>

<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Definitely. The evening was even nicer for us, me and my wife as there was no reading of bedtime stories and no computer games. By 7 o'clock, the kids were in bed, and the next thing we knew, they were out for the count!</p>

<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>Oh I think I've got it. Do you mean they were so tired from all the exercise that they fell asleep immediately their heads touched the pillows?</p>

<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Yes, that's right. Let's hear some examples how this expression is used:</p>

<p><strong>Examples</strong></p>
<p><em>Jack had so much to drink last night that when he got home he was out for the count.</em></p>
<p><em>There was some trouble outside my house last night but I didn't hear it: I was so tired I was out for the count.</em></p>


<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>Oh, how I wish I could fall asleep quickly&#151;but I often have to take a sleeping pill.</p>

<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>That's not good. You should try doing some exercise to make you tired: how about jogging?</p>

<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>Oh no, it's boring, it's too monotonous.</p>

<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Well, how about something relaxing like yoga?</p>

<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>Yoga, no, I'm not very flexible, I never have been.</p>

<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Well, what about boxing? It's exciting and you could be knocked unconscious&#151;out for the count!</p>

<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>Very funny!</p>

<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Anyway you have learned a good expression and it's time to say goodbye.</p>


<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>Bye!</p>
