	<tr><td class="roles">Female&#160;customer:</td><td> Oooh, beef please.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> There you are.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Female&#160;customer:</td><td> Thanks.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td><em>(whispering)</em> Hello and welcome to the programme&#160;... and the flight. I'm Li and I'm doing a bit of extra work as a flight stewardess. Lunchtime has just started so I'd better get back to work&#151;lots of hungry customers.
<br />
<br /> Chicken or beef sir?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Familiar&#160;customer:</td><td><em>(irritated</em>) Actually, I have a beef with you.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Beef? Ok, there you go.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Familiar&#160;customer:</td><td> No, no&#151;I don't want beef. I have a beef with you about this menu.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> You want some beef&#160;... with me? Sorry sir, I don't think we can provide that service.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Familiar&#160;customer:</td><td> Listen. My beef is you don't have vegetarian food.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Er&#160;... I'm not quite sure I understand.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Familiar&#160;customer:</td><td><em>(genuinely willing to help)</em> Oh, I'm very sorry, do let me explain. In English, we can use the word 'beef' to mean 'complaint' or 'disagreement'.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Oh I see&#160;...&#160;</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Familiar&#160;customer:</td><td> Yes&#151;we say 'I have a beef with someone or something over or about something else'&#151;a disagreement about something. Let me see if the other passengers can help give us some examples. Would you mind, sir?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Male&#160;customer:</td><td> Not at all. How about: I had a beef with my teacher about the amount of homework we were getting.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Familiar&#160;customer:</td><td> Yes&#151;if you felt you were getting too much homework you might say that! Thank you.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Male&#160;customer:</td><td> Welcome.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Familiar&#160;customer:</td><td> Anyone else?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Female&#160;customer:</td><td> Oh, I can think of one: Mark had a beef with his wife.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Familiar&#160;customer:</td><td> Very good. He had a disagreement with his wife. What was the reason? A full sentence please.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Female&#160;customer:</td><td> Mark had a beef with his wife over&#160;... over&#160;... parking their car. He thought she always parked it very badly.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Familiar&#160;customer:</td><td> Great. Well I hope she's better at parking now. Is that clear, Li?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Yes, it is now thank you teacher, I mean sir&#160;... I mean&#160;... you look a bit familiar! A bit like our presenter Finn.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Familiar&#160;customer:</td><td> Shhhh&#160;... yes it is me. But I'm on holiday&#151;not working, well only working a bit. After explaining this phrase I'm done!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Well, have a nice holiday!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Familiar&#160;customer:</td><td> Thanks. And I do still have a beef with this menu&#151;why don't you have a vegetarian option?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> We do&#151;but you need to reserve it online first, Finn, I mean sir. And while you're online, why not check out our website bbclearningenglish.com for more phrases like this one!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Familiar&#160;customer:</td><td> Yes, it's a wonderful site. Back to holidays now. Bye.</td></tr>
