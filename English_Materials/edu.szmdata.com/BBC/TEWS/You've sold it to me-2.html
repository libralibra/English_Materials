<h3><strong>Summary</strong></h3>

<p>Helen has just returned from her dream holiday and she's feeling fabulous. What about Finn, is he tempted to go on a break too? Will he get the special offer in time?</p>
<h3><strong>Transcript</strong></h3>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1"><strong>Finn<br /></strong>Hello and welcome to The English We Speak. I'm Finn.</span></p>


<p><strong>Helen</strong>
<br />Hello everyone. I'm Helen.</p>


<p><strong>Finn</strong>
<br />You look a bit different today.</p>


<p><strong>Helen</strong>
<br />Oh, really? In what way?</p>


<p><strong>Finn</strong>
<br />Erm, you are glowing, you look so energised.</p>


<p><strong>Helen</strong>
<br />Really, I'm so flattered. I was invited to this amazing place on a tiny island by my friend.</p>


<p><strong>Finn</strong>
<br />Oh wow, so you were away for the weekend?</p>


<p><strong>Helen</strong>
<br />Oh yes. It's the best holiday I've had in years.</p>


<p><strong>Finn</strong>
<br />It sounds great. What was it like?</p>


<p><strong>Helen</strong>
<br />Sun, sea, just beautiful and tranquil.</p>


<p><strong>Finn</strong>
<br />Was it expensive?</p>


<p><strong>Helen</strong>
<br />It wasn't. It was actually about &pound;200 pounds for both of us including flights. You should think about going.</p>


<p><strong>Finn</strong>
<br />Wow, you know, you've sold it to me.</p>


<p><strong>Helen</strong>
<br />Em, but I don't sell holidays. I just make English learning programmes.</p>


<p><strong>Finn</strong>
<br />No, what I mean is that I want to go. 'You've sold it to me' is a very colloquial way of saying 'you've convinced me'. Here are some examples.</p>


<p><strong>Examples</strong>
<br />A: I lost five pounds after just a week on this new diet. It's definitely worth a try.
<br />B: You've sold it to me. I need to get in shape for my school reunion.</p>

<p>A: Your phone looks amazing.
<br />B: It's brilliant, does everything, fab photos and great apps. AND it only cost me 10 pounds.
<br />A: 10 pounds. You've sold it to me. Where can I get one today?</p>


<p><strong>Helen</strong>
<br />If you're serious about going, you'd better hurry. I think the special offer ends today at noon.</p>


<p><strong>Finn</strong>
<br />What, I can't believe it. It's just past noon!</p>


<p><strong>Helen</strong>
<br />Oh no, I'm sorry. I'm sure there'll be another chance later.</p>


<p><strong>Finn</strong>
<br />Just my luck!</p>
