<p class="storyTitle">Shut up</p>
<p><em>(Li and Rosie are at the cinema)</em></p>
<table border="0">
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> No, come on&#160;... Don't do it! Don't do it!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rosie:</td><td> Li&#160;... She's an actress in a film, she can't hear you. And besides, it's rude to talk in the cinema.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> But it's just so frustrating. Don't go into the house! Don't do it! Oh, no! I can't watch!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rosie:</td><td> Li, shut up!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> I know, he's shut her up in that house and won't let her go. She's his prisoner now&#160;...&#160;</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rosie:</td><td> No, Li&#160;... I was telling <em>you</em> to shut up. It's a rude way of saying 'Be quiet.'</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Spectator:</td><td> Excuse me, will you please shut up?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rosie:</td><td> I'm really sorry. Li, I can't take you anywhere.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Oh well look, the film is over now, anyway. Sorry about the talking, but I just get a bit carried away.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rosie:</td><td> Well, I'm sorry I told you to shut up. It is quite a rude expression in English, but you just kept talking and wouldn't shut up!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> So can I tell someone to shut up when they're making noise?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rosie:</td><td> You can, but it's informal and can be rude. So, if you're in a formal context, you should say something like "Could you please be quiet?"</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> OK, so in a meeting, if someone is speaking, I won't tell them to shut up. I'll say: "Could you please be quiet?" But if I'm really annoyed at one of my friends, I can tell them to shut up.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rosie:</td><td> Yes, although sometimes it's used when people are joking in English. Let's listen to some examples:</td></tr>
</table>
<ul>
	<li><em>"I'm so tired. And thirsty. When are we going to get there? If only you'd drive a bit faster&#160;...&#160;"</em></li>
	<li><em>"Will you please shut up? I can't concentrate with your constant moaning."</em></li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><em>"I look fat in this dress. It's so clingy!"</em></li>
	<li><em>"Oh shut up! You look great."</em></li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><em>"I just read the whole book in an hour."</em></li>
	<li><em>"Shut up! No one can read that quickly."</em></li>
</ul>
<table border="0">
	<tr><td class="roles">Rosie:</td><td> So in that first example, we heard the expression 'shut up' used in a serious way. But in the second and third examples, it doesn't mean we want someone to be quiet&#151;it means: "I don't believe you" or "Don't be ridiculous!"</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> So when someone says something silly or ridiculous, we can say 'shut up'. And again, we only really do this with people we know well as it's informal. You've been warned!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rosie:</td><td> Well, one thing's for sure, I'm never, and I mean <em>never</em>, going to the cinema with you again.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Shut up! I don't believe you&#160;... You love going to cinema with me. I always buy you popcorn!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rosie:</td><td> Shut up! I always get the popcorn!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Oh, shut up.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rosie:</td><td><em> You</em> shut up&#160;...&#160;</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> No <em>you</em> shut up.</p></div></div></div></div><p><em>
<br /></em></p></div></div></div></td></tr>
