<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>Rob and Feifei take to the road to learn a new phrase. Rob sits in the back to demonstrate the phrase but Feifei soon realises you don't need a car to use this expression. Get your seatbelt on and join them in Authentic Real English.</p>
<h3>Transcript</h3>

<p>Note: This is not a word-for-word transcript.</p>

<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Hello, it's Feifei and Rob here with today's The English We Speak.</p>

<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Feifei, keep your eyes on the road! Look where you're going.</p>

<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>OK, OK! Rob is making me drive around while we present today's programme. Rob, why <em>exactly</em> am I driving my car?</p>

<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Well, I really wanted you to understand the phrase we're going to learn today. But I'm going to leave it all to you.</p>

<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>So what are you going to do then?</p>

<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Oh nothing. I'm just going to a take a back seat today. You carry on, I'll just watch.</p>

<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Take a back seat? Hmmm&#151;so you're going to let me take control&#151;do all the work&#151;while you sit there and watch?</p>

<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Yes&#151;look, I'm just sitting here&#151;on the back seat</p>

<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Oh I get it! 'To take a back seat' is an idiom that means to give up control and let someone else take responsibility.</p>

<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>That's it Feifei. Let's hear from some other people who are 'taking a back seat'&hellip;</p>

<p><strong>Examples<br /></strong>Mary was happy to take a back seat and let Jim run the meeting.</p>
<p>I'm going to take a back seat this year and let you decide where we go on holiday.</p>
<p>Now he's getting older he's decided to take a back seat in running the company.</p>

<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>So, to take a backseat means to choose not to take control and let someone else be in charge. Rob, does this mean you're just being lazy?</p>

<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Of course not, Feifei. It just means I'm letting you have a turn at being in charge&#151;I trust you&#151;although&#160;... What are you doing?!</p>

<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Letting you take the back seat while I show you how to really drive!</p>

<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Feifei! Watch out for that roundabout&#160;... and that traffic light&#160;... aren't you driving a bit fast?</p>

<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Rob&#151;don't be such a back seat driver!</p>

<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>A what?</p>

<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>A back seat driver&#151;someone who offers unwanted advice&#151;someone who tells the driver how to drive. But we'll leave that expression for another day!</p>

<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>OK OK&#151;but you are going really fast&#151;can I take the front seat now?</p>

<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Stay where you are!</p>

<p><strong>Both<br /></strong>Bye.</p>
