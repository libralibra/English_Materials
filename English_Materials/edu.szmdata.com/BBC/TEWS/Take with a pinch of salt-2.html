	<tr><td class="roles">Kaz:</td><td> Hi. You're listening to The English We Speak. I'm Kaz and today I'm having dinner at Li's house.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Hi, I'm Li and I've prepared some chocolate mousse for dessert.</p><p></td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Kaz:</td><td> Oh thanks. I love chocolate mousse. Mmm, it's delicious.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Good! Anyway, what was I saying? Oh yes, I don't know if I want to stay in this house. I mean, Chris thinks it's haunted and that there are ghosts here! He says he can sense their presence&#160;...&#160;</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Kaz:</td><td> Really? I can't sense anything.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Shhh&#160;... listen? Can you hear something?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Kaz:</td><td> No Li, I can't hear anything&#151;just the wind outside. If you want my advice, you should take it with a pinch of salt.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> OK, I will&#160;... Yuck! That's disgusting.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Kaz:</td><td> Li, what are you doing?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> I just ate my chocolate mousse with a pinch of salt, as you suggested, and it's absolutely disgusting.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Kaz:</td><td> Li, I was talking about what Chris said about ghosts in your house. In English, if you take something with a pinch of salt, it means you don't completely believe it.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Really? What a weird expression. So if I take something with a pinch of salt, it means I doubt whether something is true.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Kaz:</td><td> Yes, and sometimes Chris does exaggerate, so you shouldn't always believe everything he says.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Let's hear some examples:</td></tr>

<ul>
	<li><em>Apparently they're going to sell the company and make everyone redundant.</em></li>
	<li><em>You should take it with a pinch of salt; it's only a rumour.</em></li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><em>The other day he told me he speaks 23 languages fluently.</em></li>
	<li><em>I take everything he says with a pinch of salt because I know he likes to exaggerate.</em></li>

<table border="0">
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Ah, right. So when Chris told me there were spirits or ghosts in my house, I should take it with a pinch of salt. Maybe he's just making it up to scare me!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Kaz:</td><td> I'm sure he just said it as a joke. Do you want some more chocolate mousse&#151;without a pinch of salt this time?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Good idea. Mmm, it does taste really nice without salt.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>&#160;</td><td class="stageDescriptions">(Sound of banging, creaking)</td></tr>

	<tr><td class="roles">Kaz:</td><td> What the&#160;...&#160;? Hang on a minute, I recognise that voice.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Chris, Chris? Is that you? Why are you covered in a white sheet?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Chris:</td><td> I'm a ghost that's come to haunt you&#160;... I heard you made some chocolate mousse, Li, so I came over to eat some&#160;... Ooooo&#160;...&#160;</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> You scared us! I really do have to take what you say and do with a pinch of salt.</td></tr>
