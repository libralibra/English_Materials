	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Hello and welcome to The English We Speak from BBC Learning English. I'm Rob.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> Hello, I'm Helen. This is the programme where we try to help you understand language often heard in English conversations.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Well, I went to a presentation this morning and I heard a word that made me laugh.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> What is it?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> See if you can guess, Helen. Let's play a word game. Are you ready?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> Yes I am.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td>OK. Well, It's made up of two words and the first word is a cute little animal.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> OK.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> And if you kiss this animal, it may turn into a prince.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> I know this one. If you kiss a frog, it turns into a prince. The first word is 'frog'.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Well done. The second word is the type of walk that soldiers do.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> Easy&#151;marching.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> You got it. I heard the word 'frogmarch' this morning. And do you know what we call a lot of frogs together?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> A school of frogs?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> No.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> A herd of frogs?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> No, it's an 'army' of frogs. I just have this cartoon picture in my mind of an army of frogs all wearing boots and marching down the river.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> Oh that's hilarious. But what does 'frogmarch' really mean? Surely it's not a way of marching.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> No, 'to frogmarch' means to force someone who is unwilling to move forward or to walk somewhere, often by holding their arms tightly. Here are some examples.</td></tr>
	<tr><td/><td class="examples">The drunken suspect was handcuffed by the police and frogmarched to the waiting police van.</td></tr>
	<tr><td/><td class="examples">In major sporting events, if you disrupt the game, you risk being frogmarched out of the stadium b</em><em>y security guards.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> Ouch, that's pretty harsh, isn't it? So how did you hear it used?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> The presenter told us that his lecture on social dynamics was a must for everyone and so we either all had to sign up voluntarily or he would frogmarch us there himself.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> Oh, that's a threat.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Exactly, so of course we all signed up.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> Very effective. The next time I want full attendance, I'll know exactly what to say.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Frogmarching someone? Well, make sure you have enough people to do the job. It usually takes at least two people to frogmarch one person. Bye bye.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> Bye.</td></tr>
