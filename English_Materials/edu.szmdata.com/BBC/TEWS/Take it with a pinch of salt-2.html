	<tr><td class="roles">Neil:</td><td> Hello Helen. Thanks for inviting me here. It's a lovely cafe, isn't it?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> Yes, it is, Neil. Actually, I wanted to ask you a favour. I know you play the piano and I'd like you to teach me.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Waitress:</td><td>Here is your tea. Madam, sir&#160;...&#160;</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td>Thank you. I'll pour it.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Neil:</td><td> I'd be happy to teach you the piano. Are you buying one?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> No. Our colleague John is giving me one.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Neil:</td><td> Giving you a piano?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td>Yes. He said he's moving to Australia and will give me his piano. Sugar in your tea?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Neil:</td><td> I'd take that with a pinch of salt!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> Oh&#160;... OK.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Neil:</td><td> What are you doing?!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> You said you would take that with a pinch of salt, so I am putting some in your tea.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Neil:</td><td> No, I didn't mean put salt in my tea! I was talking about our colleague John. You need to take what John says with a pinch of salt.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td>I'm confused.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Neil:</td><td>In English, when we say 'take it with a pinch of salt', we mean don't believe in it completely because it might not be true.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> Oh. So, John's not going to give me his piano?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Neil:</td><td>John's always planning to move abroad and promising things. I'm still waiting for a sofa he promised me last year. He said he was going to Peru!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td>Oh, I see.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Neil:</td><td>'With a pinch of salt' is today's expression in The English We Speak. Here are some examples of how it's used.</td></tr>
	<tr><td/><td class="examples">When my cousin says he has absolutely no money, you have to</em><em>take that with a pinch of salt. He's just mean.</td></tr>
	<tr><td/><td class="examples">I take everything Mary says with a pinch of salt. She tends to exaggerate things.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> Thank you for warning me, Neil. John is a good person but he can't make up his mind.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Neil:</td><td> That's right. But if you ever want to learn to play the piano, I can teach you. I'm not very good at it but I can teach you what I know. And you don't need to take that with a pinch of salt.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td>Oh, you're such a sweetie!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Neil:</td><td> A sweetie who likes his tea with sugar rather than salt.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td> I'm sorry about that!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Neil:</td><td> Bye.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Helen:</td><td>Bye.</td></tr>
