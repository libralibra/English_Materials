<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>

<p>Finn arrives late for the studio recording. When he finally arrives, why does Li say that a woman from the marketing department fancies him?</p>


<p><strong>Transcript</strong></p>

<p>Note: This is not a word-for-word transcript.</p>

<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>Welcome to The English We Speak, I'm Li. I've got a word connected to love to teach you today&#160;... But where's Finn? I'll call his mobile.</p>
<p><em>(Phone ringing as Finn comes in breathless)</em></p>

<p><strong>Finn<br /></strong>Hi Li. Sorry I'm late. I just couldn't get away.</p>

<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>Oh! Finn, there you are. You couldn't get away, from what?</p>

<p><strong>Finn<br /></strong>You know I gave a presentation at lunch time about our new Shakespeare series?</p>

<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>Yeah, but that finished over an hour ago.</p>

<p><strong>Finn<br /></strong>Yeah, yeah I know. But this woman from the marketing department kept asking me questions. You know, she said she loves Shakespeare.</p>

<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>Was anyone else there?</p>

<p><strong>Finn<br /></strong>No, it was just the two of us. I tried to get away but she kept asking more and more questions.</p>

<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>Oh dear Finn, I think it might be you that she fancies, not Shakespeare.</p>

<p><strong>Finn<br /></strong>Oh, you think so? Oh, and actually, that is a good word to learn. If you fancy someone, you find them physically attractive.</p>

<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>Yes, that's a good definition. Let's hear some examples:</p>

<p><strong>Examples<br /></strong>Look at the figure-hugging clothes you're wearing, Betty. Is there someone you fancy at the party?</p>
<p>He's a lovely guy. We're really good friends. Actually, I fancy him a little&hellip;</p>

<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>So if you fancy someone, you want to go out with them, don't you?</p>

<p><strong>Finn<br /></strong>Yes, you do. Actually, that woman at the Shakespeare presentation was very nice&hellip; You know, interesting, pretty&hellip;</p>

<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>It sounds like you fancy her as well, don't you, Finn?</p>

<p><strong>Finn<br /></strong>Well, I think she fancies me more. Look at this!</p>

<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>Wow! Did she give you this box of chocolates?</p>

<p><strong>Finn<br /></strong>Yes, nice isn't it? Do you fancy one?</p>

<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>Of course! But let's say goodbye before we go.</p>

<p><strong>Finn and Li<br /></strong>Bye!</p>
