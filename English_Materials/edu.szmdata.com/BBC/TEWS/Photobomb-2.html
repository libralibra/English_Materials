<h3>Transcript</h3>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Hello and welcome to The English We Speak, I'm Feifei</p>


<p><strong><span>Sian
<br /></span></strong>&hellip;and I'm, Sian. Hello! How was your weekend Feifei?</p>


<p><strong>Feifei</strong>
<br /> It was awesome! I went to that film premi&egrave;re&#151;and look who I managed to get a photo with on the red carpet!</p>


<p><strong>Sian</strong>
<br /> Oh wow! He's even got his arm around you!</p>


<p><strong>Feifei</strong>
<br /> I know&#151;Exciting huh? I'm going to get this picture printed out and put on my wall!</p>


<p><strong>Sian</strong>
<br /> Ha ha oh dear&#151;have you seen this guy behind you making a funny face? Look here on the left.</p>


<p><strong>Feifei</strong>
<br />Where? Let me see! Oh no, I didn't notice him. Oh he's totally ruined it.</p>


<p><strong>Sian</strong>
<br /> You know we have a word for that? When an unexpected person appears in a photo as it's being taken?</p>


<p><strong>Feifei</strong>
<br /> Yes&#151;it's called a photobomb or you can photobomb someone. Let's hear some examples:</p>


<p><strong><span>Examples<span>
<br /></span></span></strong>Oh no! My graduation photo has been totally ruined by a photobomber! Look</p>

<p>This photo of my girlfriend and me would have been really nice, but my sister photobombed it!</p>


<p><strong><span>Feifei
<br /></span></strong>So people photobomb as a kind of practical joke? I don't think it's very nice to ruin someone's photo though.</p>


<p><strong><span>Sian
<br /></span></strong>Well not always, photobombing&#151;can also be done by accident, in fact even animals can photobomb! Lets hear another example.</p>


<p><strong><span>Examples
<br /></span></strong>Look at this hilarious website showing pictures of animals photobombing. I think the goat one is the funniest!</p>


<p><strong><span>Sian
<br /></span></strong>You know Feifei I don't think it's ruined your photo&#151;it's actually really funny. Look here, I was photobombed once too.</p>


<p><strong> Feifei</strong>
<br />That's a nice pic &hellip; hang on! Is that the Queen in the background?</p>


<p><strong>Sian<br /></strong>Yes, I was photobombed by the Queen of England!</p>


<p><strong><span data-mce-mark="1">Feifei
<br /></span></strong>Well that photobomb has improved your photo&#151;I don't think it's the same for mine though. I'm going to find a way to get rid of him from my perfect photo. Bye!</p>


<p><strong><span>Sian
<br /></span></strong>Good luck. Bye!</p>
