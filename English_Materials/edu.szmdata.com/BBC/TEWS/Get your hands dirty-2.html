	<tr><td class="roles">Yang&#160;Li:</td><td> For the neighbourhood festival&#151;it's tonight you know!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Neil:</td><td> I know. But I think I'm going to be having a shower and making myself clean, rather than dirty. Maybe this is some kind of low-cost spa treatment&#160;...&#160;?</td></tr>

	<tr><td class="roles">Neil:</td><td> Did he?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Yang&#160;Li:</td><td> Yes, last week he asked each of us to contribute and said if it's going to be a success, you must all get your hands dirty.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Neil:</td><td> Ohhhhhh!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Yang&#160;Li:</td><td> What?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Neil:</td><td> I don't think he meant you should actually come with dirty hands. It's an expression!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Yang&#160;Li:</td><td> An expression?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Neil:</td><td> Yes. 'To get your hands dirty' means to get really involved in the work&#151;including the parts that are not enjoyable&#151;rather than standing back and watching others do it.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Yang&#160;Li:</td><td> Oh.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Neil:</td><td> For example.

	<tr><td class="roles">Yang&#160;Li:</td><td> You know what? I don't care, I was really beginning to enjoy myself in the mud, and I'm sure my skin feels softer. Come on Neil, try, this is fun. Let's get our hands dirty&#151;for real! Come on, come on&#160;...&#160;</td></tr>
