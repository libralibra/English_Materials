<table border="0">
	<tr><td class="roles">William:</td><td> Hello and welcome to The English We Speak. I'm William Kremer.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Yang&#160;Li:</td><td> And I'm Yang Li.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">William:</td><td> So this Sunday is Father's Day here in the UK and in many countries around the world.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Yang&#160;Li:</td><td> William, I know you are married but you are not a father yet, right?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">William:</td><td> Yes, that's right.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Yang&#160;Li:</td><td> Well in that case, I don't think you are well qualified to talk about this topic, William!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">William:</td><td> Well, I disagree. All that matters is that we can speak English! So today I thought we could look at a couple of very common phrases relating to fatherhood. Let's listen to this clip of a woman talking to her friend about her son. Try and hear a phrase relating to fatherhood.</td></tr>
	<tr>
		<td/>
		<td>
			<table border="0" class="examples">
				<tr><td class="roles">Woman:</td><td>And how's Jonathan?</td></tr>
				<tr><td class="roles">Woman&#160;2:</td><td>Good question&#151;I'd like to know the answer! He's ever so quiet and I never know what he's thinking&#160;...&#160;</td></tr>
				<tr><td class="roles">Woman:</td><td>Oh yeah.</td></tr>
				<tr><td class="roles">Woman&#160;2:</td><td>Mind you, his dad's exactly the same. Like father, like son.</td></tr>
			</table>
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Yang&#160;Li:</td><td>Like father, like son. So that means that the son is just like the father, is that right?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">William:</td><td> Exactly, yes.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Yang&#160;Li:</td><td> So, William, can you say 'like mother, like daughter'?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">William:</td><td> Well, you could say that but it's not really a phrase in English. 'Like father, like son' is quite a common phrase. And you have to use those exact words, you can't say 'Like his father, like my son'&#151;it has to be 'like father, like son'.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Yang&#160;Li:</td><td> So are you like your father, William?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">William:</td><td> That's a good question. What do you think, Dad?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">William's Dad:</td><td> Oh, that's a difficult question&#151;</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Yang&#160;Li:</td><td>Wow, I didn't know&#151;I didn't realise you were here, Mr Kremer! It's very nice to meet you! Very nice to meet you.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">William's Dad:</td><td> Nice to meet you too. I always like to keep an eye on William, make sure he's being a good son. And I think I was a good son to my father, so in that way, I think he is like me.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> I think you look quite alike, except that William is much taller than you&#151;he is a giant!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">William's Dad:</td><td> I have to carry a chair with me wherever I go just to keep up with him!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">William:</td><td> Alright, Dad. So, before we finish today, let's have a look at another phrase connected with fatherhood. And this phrase means a long time before you were born. In this clip a woman is talking to her uncle. Try and hear the phrase.</td></tr>
	<tr>
		<td/>
		<td>
			<table border="0" class="examples">
				<tr><td class="roles">Woman:</td><td>I didn't know you used to have a motorbike!</td></tr>
				<tr><td class="roles">Man:</td><td>Oh yes. I had one for a couple of years&#160;... it must have been in the sixties; before you were even a twinkle in your father's eye!</td></tr>
			</table>
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Yang&#160;Li:</td><td> Wow that was quite a long phrase&#151;'Before you were even a twinkle in your father's eye.'</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">William:</td><td>Yeah, or you could say, 'You weren't even a twinkle in your father's eye'. A twinkle is something that shines brightly, like a star. So it's quite a romantic word. Maybe the phrase means: before your father ever looked at your mother in a romantic way; so, long before you were born.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Yang&#160;Li:</td><td> Well, we hope that these English phrases might be useful to you this Sunday. Happy Father's Day!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">William:</td><td> Happy Father's Day!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">William's Dad:</td><td>Oh thanks guys!</td></tr>
