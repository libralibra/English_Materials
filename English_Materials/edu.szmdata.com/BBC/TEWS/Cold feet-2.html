	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Why?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Well, because I work very hard, I get results, I do much more than I really should, and nobody notices&#151;I don't get any recognition.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Yes, you do work hard, Rob. You should earn a fortune!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> I know. You see&#151;that's it! I'm going to go and see the boss right now! I am going to ask for a pay rise!</td></tr>

	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Well, actually, I'm getting cold feet.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> That's no problem at all. Let's see&#160;... I have a solution right here&#160;... There you go. Take these.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Thick, woolly socks?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Yes. You should feel warm when talking to a tough boss like ours! Come on, use these.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> It's OK. There's nothing wrong with my feet, Li. In English, when we say we've got cold feet we mean we lack the confidence or courage to do something.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> So you're afraid of going into our boss's office.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Yes, I must admit I am a bit. Let's hear some examples of how to use today's expression 'cold feet', in The English We Speak.</td></tr>
	<tr><td/><td class="examples">Mary knew Tony had bought her engagement ring and was planning to propose on Valentine's Day. She just hoped he wouldn't get cold feet before then.</td></tr>
	<tr><td/><td class="examples">The company directors were getting cold feet about a deal which could make or break their business.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> So, no need for these socks. But thank you anyway, Li.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Maybe next week you can approach the boss and remind him what a good worker you are.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Good idea. Maybe that's the right way to do it.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> One thing is true: your cold feet saved you from your hot head.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Yes indeed.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Bye bye.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Rob:</td><td> Bye.</td></tr>
