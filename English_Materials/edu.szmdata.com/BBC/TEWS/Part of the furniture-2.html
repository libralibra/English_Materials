<p><strong>Helen<br /></strong>Hello and welcome to The English We Speak. I'm Helen and joining me today is Neil.</p>


<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Hello everyone.</p>


<p><strong>Helen<br /></strong>Neil, guess who I met yesterday?</p>


<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>No idea. Anyone I know?</p>


<p><strong>Helen<br /></strong>The name is Jonathan Kendall&#151;he said you guys worked together a long time ago.</p>


<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Oh yes, we did. Gosh, it must have been nearly 15 years ago if my memory is right.</p>


<p><strong>Helen<br /></strong>Wow, that is a long time ago.</p>


<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>So what's he doing now?</p>


<p><strong>Helen<br /></strong>He works at Radio Melody. He's now the station manager.</p>


<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Is he still there? Wow, he really is part of the furniture.</p>


<p><strong>Helen<br /></strong>What do you mean 'he's part of the furniture'? He is a person, not a sofa or a table.</p>


<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Oh, I don't mean it literally. It's an expression we use to describe someone or something that's been in the same place for a very long time. You almost that think they'll be there forever. Let's listen to a few examples.</p>


<p><strong>Examples<br /></strong>John has been the school caretaker for nearly twenty years. He's become part of the furniture.</p>

<p>We come here so often, it's almost as if we are part of the furniture.</p>

<p>She's had a seat in parliament for over 50 years&#151;she's part of the furniture in the House of Commons.</p>


<p><strong>Helen<br /></strong>Right, I've got it. So how long have you been at the BBC?</p>


<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>I've lost count. Let me see, I left school at 18, did an apprenticeship for 2 years and then I joined the BBC in 1995.</p>


<p><strong>Helen<br /></strong>That's twenty years. My goodness! So you are part of the furniture at the BBC!</p>


<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Yes, you are absolutely right. Where have all the years gone?</p>


<p><strong>Helen<br /></strong>Will you be here for the next twenty years?</p>


<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Who knows? Let's wait and see.</p>
