<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>Feifei has a nice surprise for Rob&#151;tickets to see their favourite singer. It's an unexpected surprise but where did she get them from? Rob uses an expression which leads to some confusion. Maybe this programme will pull an explanation out of the hat?!</p>
<h3>Transcript</h3>

<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Hello and welcome to The English We Speak. I'm Feifei and I'm waiting for Rob&hellip; I have some good news for him!</p>

<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Oh hi Feifei. You're looking very pleased with yourself.</p>

<p><strong>Feifei</strong>
<br /> Yes, I am. You know that new singer we really really like and wanted to go and see?</p>

<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>You mean Justin Timberriver?</p>

<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Yes him. And you know that his world tour is a sell-out&#151;there are no tickets left?</p>

<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Yes, sadly.</p>

<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Well, look at these!</p>

<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Wow! Two tickets to see Justin Timberriver in London tomorrow! That's amazing, how did you manage to pull those out of the hat?</p>

<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Err Rob&#151;I didn't pull them out of anyone's hat&#151;I used my own money to buy them from a friend.</p>

<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>No Feifei&#151;if you 'pull something out of a hat' it means you produce something unexpectedly&#151;by surprise&#151;and solves a problem.</p>

<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>OK, I see! So these tickets are an unexpected surprise?</p>

<p><strong>Rob</strong>
<br /> Yes&#151;I thought we would never get any. Let's hear some more examples while I calm down!</p>

<p><strong>Examples<br /></strong>We thought we'd never complete the project on time but somehow, Javeed managed to pull it out of the hat.</p>
<p>Our team has had a bad season but they still managed to pull a cup victory out of the hat by the end of it.</p>

<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>So, if you pull something out of a hat, you do something that is not expected and it makes a bad situation better. You can also say 'to pull something out of thin air'. So it's like magic?</p>

<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Yes. It's just like how a magician pulls a rabbit out of a hat&#151;I don't suppose you could do that could you?</p>

<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>No Rob. But maybe you could pull something out of the hat for me?</p>

<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Oh, what's that?</p>

<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>The tickets cost &pound;100 each&#151;could I have the money now please?</p>

<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>&pound;100? Where am I going to find that?</p>

<p><strong>Feifei</strong>
<br /> Look inside that silly hat you're wearing.</p>

<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>It's not silly.</p>

<p><strong>Both</strong>
<br /> Bye!</p>
