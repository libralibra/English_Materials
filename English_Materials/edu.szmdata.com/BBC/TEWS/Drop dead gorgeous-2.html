	<tr><td class="roles">Jen:</td><td> Hello, I'm Jennifer. Welcome to The English We Speak. I'm joined today by Li&#151;hi Li!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Hello everyone.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Jen:</td><td> I've been dying to see you all day. I met up with Rosie last night, and I met her new boyfriend too!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Oh, tell me more! What's he like?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Jen:</td><td> Well, he seemed very charming and intelligent, very kind too, but she hadn't told me that he is drop dead gorgeous!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> What?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Jen:</td><td> Yes, don't tell her, but I'd definitely say he is drop dead gorgeous!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> But&#160;... he's dead&#160;...&#160;? Do you mean he's actually dead, like a zombie? Or maybe he just looks dead. Sometimes when I'm tired I get dark circles under my eyes and look like death!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Jen:</td><td> Of course he's not dead&#151;he's very much alive.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> So, what did you mean by 'drop dead gorgeous'?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Jen:</td><td> It's just one of those phrases we use in English that you can't take too literally. If someone is described as 'drop dead gorgeous', it means they are really good looking.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Strange phrase&#160;...&#160;</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Jen:</td><td> Think of it this way: Imagine someone who is so good looking, so handsome, that your heart starts beating really fast, you start to feel short of breath, and you just drop down dead!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Someone so good looking, so handsome&#160;... Yes, I've thought of someone&#160;... My heart is beating fast just thinking of him!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Jen:</td><td> OK, well, while you're thinking of your fancy man, let's hear some more examples of the phrase 'drop dead gorgeous' in action&#160;...&#160;</td></tr>
	<tr><td/><td class="examples">Daniel Craig is in town for the premiere of the new James Bond film. I love him as Bond&#151;he's drop dead gorgeous in a tuxedo!</td></tr>
	<tr><td/><td class="examples">I'm going on a date with a girl from my university next week. I can't believe she wants to go out with me&#151;she's drop dead gorgeous.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Jen:</td><td> So you see, it's a great phrase to use when describing someone who is handsome or good looking, like Rosie's new man.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> It's a really good phrase and I'll definitely try to use it.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Jen:</td><td> So, Li, are you going to tell me which handsome man you were thinking of earlier?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> Well, I'd really rather not&#160;...&#160;</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Jen:</td><td> Don't be like that! Who is it? Is it someone I know&#160;...&#160;?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> No!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Jen:</td><td> It is someone I know! Come on, Li, tell me, I won't tell anyone. Who do you think is drop dead gorgeous?</td></tr>

	<tr><td class="roles">Jen:</td><td> But Li&#160;... that's&#160;... the boss?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Li:</td><td> He really is drop dead gorgeous! Don't tell anyone!</td></tr>
