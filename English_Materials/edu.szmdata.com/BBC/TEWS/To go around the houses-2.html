<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Hello and welcome to The English We Speak, with me Feifei&#160;...&#160;</p>


<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>&#160;...&#160;and me, Rob. Hello!<strong></strong></p>


<p><strong>Feifei</strong>
<br />Rob, I've been meaning to ask&#160;... you've got a car haven't you?</p>


<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Yes, Feifei, I have.</p>


<p><strong>Feifei</strong>
<br />Is it a quite special car? You know, a valuable, expensive one?</p>


<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>No no, it's just an old car&#151;but it gets me around. Why are you asking?</p>


<p><strong>Feifei</strong>
<br />Oh no reason&#160;... you don't use it much do you?</p>


<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>No&#160;... Feifei there's no need to go around the houses&#151;just say what you want to say.</p>


<p><strong>Feifei</strong>
<br />OK&#160;... can I borrow your car please? But don't worry, I won't take it around the houses&#151;I just want to go to the supermarket.</p>


<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Ha! Feifei when I said there's no need 'to go around the houses'; I wasn't referring to where you drive my car. I mean, you don't have to waste time saying lots of unimportant things before you actually say what you want to say.</p>


<p><strong>Feifei</strong>
<br />I see! So I should just say what I want to say&#151;I should get to the point?</p>


<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Yes, that's another way of putting it. Basically it means you take a long time to say or do something, when in reality it can be done or said a lot quicker. Let's hear some examples of the phrase 'to go around the houses' in action&#160;...&#160;</p>


<p><strong>Examples</strong></p>

<p>Don't go around the houses; just tell me straight, what have you done?</p>

<p>He went all around the houses talking about the match but all I wanted to know was who won?</p>

<p>I didn't know how to tell him he'd failed his exams so I went all around the houses before I let him know.</p>


<p><strong>Feifei</strong>
<br />So, to go around the houses means you go a long way round before asking what you want to ask. Rob, you haven't answered <em>my</em> question yet.</p>


<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Oh yes, what was the question?</p>


<p><strong>Feifei</strong>
<br />Can I borrow your car&#160;... please?</p>


<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Oh well, erm, I need to fill it up with petrol&#160;...&#160;</p>


<p><strong>Feifei</strong>
<br />Oh right&#160;...&#160;</p>


<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>And I need to drive to work&#160;...&#160;</p>


<p><strong>Feifei</strong>
<br />But that's not until Monday!</p>


<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>It's not very tidy inside&#160;...&#160;</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Rob&#151;don't go around the houses&#151;your answer is 'no' isn't it?</p>


<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Yes Feifei. You can't borrow it. I crashed it last week&#151;nobody can drive it!</p>


<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>You certainly won't be going around any houses then Rob!</p>


<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Very funny Feifei!</p>


<p><strong>Both<br /></strong>Bye!</p>
