	<tr><td class="roles">William:</td><td> Hello! Hi! My name's William. I'm six years old and this is my best friend, Wang Fei.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Wang&#160;Fei:</td><td> Oh&#160;... hello everybody.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">William:</td><td> (<em>Yawn</em>) I feel sleepy! It’s almost time for beddy-byes!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Wang&#160;Fei:</td><td> Er&#160;... William, why are you speaking so strangely?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">William:</td><td> I'm pretending that I’m six years old.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Wang&#160;Fei:</td><td> Six years old! No wonder you sound more intelligent than normal.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">William:</td><td> Ha ha, very funny. Well, the reason I'm talking like a six-year-old is that last Sunday, 15 May, was International Day of the Family. So I thought it might be nice to look at some language which is used by children and with children.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Wang&#160;Fei:</td><td> So is the language used with children special in some way?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">William:</td><td> Yeah, I think in English, like in any language, you wouldn’t use difficult words when you are talking to young children. And probably, like in any language, there are some special words that we tend to use only with children.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Wang&#160;Fei:</td><td> Special words&#160;... such as?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">William:</td><td> Such as the phrase that I used a moment ago, beddy-byes.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Wang&#160;Fei:</td><td> Beddy-byes. What's this?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">William:</td><td> Well, if I say, 'beddy-byes', that means, 'time for bed'. Let’s listen to this clip of a father talking to his little boy. As you listen, see if you can hear some other examples of baby talk.</td></tr>

			<table border="0" class="examples">
				<tr><td class="roles">Father:</td><td>Come on Alex, beddy-byes! Beddy-byes! Have you got your teddy? Put on your jim-jams. Put on your jim-jams&#151;that’s it! On they go. Jump into bed, then. Sleepy time!</td></tr>

	<tr><td class="roles">Wang&#160;Fei:</td><td> In that clip, I heard the man say 'jim-jams'.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">William:</td><td> Yes, he said 'put on your jim-jams'. Jim-jams is a baby phrase for pyjamas&#151;the clothes that we wear to sleep in. He also made sure that his little boy had his teddy, his soft cuddly toy.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Wang&#160;Fei:</td><td> And then at the end, he didn’t say goodnight to him.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">William:</td><td> No, he said 'nighty-night'. Now, there was a lot of language in that clip, so let’s hear it again.</td></tr>
