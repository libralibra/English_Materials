<h3>Transcript</h3>


<p><strong>Feifei</strong>
<br />Hello and welcome to The English We Speak. I'm Feifei&hellip;</p>


<p><strong>Rob</strong>
<br />&hellip; and hello, I'm Rob. So Feifei, how was your holiday&#151;did you go anywhere special?</p>


<p><strong>Feifei</strong>
<br />Yes, I did. I went walking.</p>


<p><strong>Rob</strong>
<br />Very healthy. And where did you go?</p>


<p><strong>Feifei</strong>
<br />Oh, I walked up Mount Everest&hellip;. It was tough and cold but I made it.</p>


<p><strong>Rob</strong>
<br />Oh&hellip; You walked up Mount Everest&#151;the highest mountain in the world? Are you sure?</p>


<p><strong>Feifei</strong>
<br />You don't think I'm fit enough to do it, do you?</p>


<p><strong>Rob</strong>
<br />Come on Feifei, you're pulling my leg.</p>


<p><strong>Feifei</strong>
<br />I'm not even touching you.</p>


<p><strong>Rob</strong>
<br />No, I don't mean you're actually pulling my leg&#151;I mean you're lying aren't you? You're joking with me?</p>


<p><strong>Feifei</strong>
<br />You think I'm not telling the truth&#151;I'm tricking you? But am I?!</p>


<p><strong>Rob</strong>
<br />Come on Feifei, stop teasing me&#151;you didn't do it did you?</p>


<p><strong>Feifei</strong>
<br />I did. I'll show you some photos. But let me hear some more examples of the phrase in action first&hellip;</p>


<p><strong>Examples</strong>
<br />A: So I got to the restaurant and sat down at my table and guess who was sitting on the next table&#151;George Clooney!
<br />B: You're pulling my leg!</p>

<p>I was pulling his leg when I said I was going to marry Jenny but he believed me and bought me a present!</p>

<p>Oh stop pulling my leg&#151;you can't have won the lottery, you didn't even buy a ticket!</p>


<p><strong>Feifei</strong>
<br />So to pull someone's leg means to fool or trick them but in a fun way. Look at this photo Rob, you can see how much snow there was on Everest&#151;and look, there's me on top.</p>


<p><strong>Rob</strong>
<br />Hold on&#151;this is a trick photo&#151;you had this taken in one of those photo-booths where you stand in front of a big screen. You're not pulling my leg!</p>


<p><strong>Feifei</strong>
<br />Ooo&hellip; ouch&hellip; actually&hellip;</p>


<p><strong>Rob</strong>
<br />It looks like you've pulled something in your own leg&#151;a muscle, maybe? Who's the fool now?</p>


<p><strong>Feifei</strong>
<br />Ok, I didn't walk up Everest. I was teasing you but you almost believed me!</p>


<p><strong>Rob</strong>
<br />Didn't.</p>


<p><strong>Feifei</strong>
<br />Did!</p>


<p><strong>Rob</strong>
<br />Did not.</p>


<p><strong>Feifei</strong>
<br />Did.</p>

<p></p>
