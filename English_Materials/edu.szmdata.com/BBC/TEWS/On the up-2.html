<p class="storyTitle">On the up</p>
<p>(Jennifer and Jean are finishing work for the day.)
<table border="0">
	<tr><td class="roles">Jennifer:</td><td> Jean, look at the time! It's 5 o'clock. Time to go home. Are you coming out for a drink after work?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Jean:</td><td> Sure, shall we go to the bar on the ground floor?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Jennifer:</td><td> Great idea, I love it there. It's very handy working six floors above one of the best bars in London!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Jean:</td><td> I know. Let's go. Shall we take the stairs? I know six floors is a long way down, but the lift is always broken.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Jennifer:</td><td> I think it's been fixed now&#160;... let's see&#160;...&#160;
<br />
<br />(Pushes button, lift doors open)</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Jean:</td><td> It has been fixed. Great!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Jennifer:</td><td> Things are on the up in this place!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Jean:</td><td> Up? That's not right, we need to go down. The bar is on the ground floor, we are on the sixth, so we definitely shouldn't be going up&#160;...&#160;</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Jennifer:</td><td> No, that's not what I mean. In English, the phrase 'on the up' is used to describe something that is improving, or getting better. Things are 'on the up' here&#151;they are getting better because the lift has been fixed.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Jean:</td><td> I see!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Jennifer:</td><td> Let's hear some more examples of this phrase.</td></tr>
</table>
<ul>
	<li>My sister has just got a new job. The company has given her a house and a car as part of the deal&#151;things are on the up for her!</li>
	<li>The economy is on the up now that the new government is in power. They've already helped to create thousands of new jobs!</li>
</ul>
<table border="0">
	<tr><td class="roles">Jean:</td><td> On the up. Great phrase!
<br />
<br />(Lift bell rings)</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Jennifer:</td><td> Well, here we are, I'll get the drinks in. What would you like?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Jean:</td><td> I think I'll go for a cocktail, please, a Cosmopolitan maybe?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Jennifer:</td><td> No problem, I'll get one too. Two Cosmopolitans, please.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Barman:</td><td> It's your lucky day! All cocktails are half price today!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Jean:</td><td> Brilliant, things are on the up because the price has gone down!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Jennifer:</td><td> Very good!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Jean:</td><td> Cheers! (Clinking glasses)</td></tr>
