<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>Bait is what you use to attract and catch something, such as a fish. But what's clickbait? Join Neil and Feifei on a beautiful English riverbank to learn about this word that describes tempting online links.</p>
<h3>Transcript</h3>

<p><strong>Neil</strong>
<br /> Hello and welcome to this beautiful riverside for this edition of The English We Speak. We're going to teach you a new word connected to the internet. I'm Neil and with me is Feifei.</p>

<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Hi there.</p>

<p><strong>Neil</strong>
<br /> Nothing beats a bit of fishing for relaxation, does it Feifei? Can you pass me the bait?</p>

<p><strong>Feifei</strong>
<br /> Bait&#151;that's the stuff you use to attract the fish. Worms are often used. OK Neil, but where is the bait?</p>

<p><strong>Neil</strong>
<br /> Don't say we forgot to bring it. OK, well, let's just have a look on my smartphone for places nearby we can buy some&#160;... Oh look at this Feifei&#151;how to earn a million pounds a year working from home.</p>

<p><strong>Feifei</strong>
<br /> Don't follow that link Neil&#151;it's just clickbait. It'll be some nonsense.</p>

<p><strong>Neil</strong>
<br /> Clickbait. As we said, 'bait' is something used to attract fish when you are trying to catch them. Clickbait is a link on a website that's trying to attract you&#151;to make you click on it.</p>

<p><strong>Feifei</strong>
<br /> It's a word made up of two words: click and bait. Clickbait. Here are some examples.</p>


<p><strong>Example<br /></strong>I can never read a long article online. I'm so distracted by the clickbait I always end up on some other site.</p>
<p>I should have known that article wasn't really going to be about Justin Bieber. They're just using his image as clickbait!</p>
<p>I used to love social media but now it's just full of adverts and clickbait. Rubbish!</p>

<p><strong>Neil</strong>
<br /> Clickbait. A link on a website designed to draw your attention and make you click!</p>

<p><strong>Feifei</strong>
<br /> It has a quite negative sense. You feel a little like you've been tricked when you click on clickbait.</p>

<p><strong>Neil</strong>
<br /> That's right. The main aim of the clickbait is to get hits to a site rather than genuinely informing you. Right, now Feifei, how are we going to get some worms to make this fishing trip a success?</p>

<p><strong>Feifei</strong>
<br /> Let's have another look at your phone&#151;oh look, 'Celebrity clothing failures&#160;...&#160;'</p>

<p><strong>Neil</strong>
<br /> Feifei, that's clickbait. I need bait!</p>

<p><strong>Both</strong>
<br /> Bye!</p>
