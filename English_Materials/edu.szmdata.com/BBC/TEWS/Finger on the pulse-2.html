<p class="storyTitle">Finger on the pulse</p>
<p>(Finn and Feifei are in the cinema; the film is about to start)
<table border="0">
	<tr><td class="roles">Finn:</td><td> Hi, I'm Finn. This is The English We Speak. And this is Feifei.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> Hi. I hope you can hear me. This cinema is very crowded! I've never heard of this movie&#160;... and who are these actors, Finn?!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Finn:</td><td> Well, Feifei, when it comes to the best new actors, I have my finger on the pulse.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> Finger on the pulse? Oh, don't do that here, Finn. You mean you touch the wrists of all these film actors? Where is your British reserve?!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Finn:</td><td> No. I am not going to touch anybody's pulse or wrists and my fingers are here, in my popcorn. In English, 'to have your finger on the pulse' means: to be familiar with the latest trends and developments.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> Ahhhh, that's a relief.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Finn:</td><td> You might hear the expression 'to have your finger on the pulse' or 'to keep your finger on the pulse'. Let's hear some examples.</td></tr>
	<tr><td/><td class="examples">You have to keep your finger on the pulse of consumer trends if you want to succeed in business.</td></tr>
	<tr><td/><td class="examples">How do I manage to dress so well all the time? I buy this fashion magazine every week because it really has its finger on the pulse.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> Ah I see. So this expression is about keeping up-to-date with trends.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Finn:</td><td> Yes it is.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> Finn, I've been looking at the poster of the film while we wait for the door to open and&#160;... this film&#160;...&#160;</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Finn:</td><td> 'The City That Never Sleeps'. Yes?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> There is a picture of a zombie on the poster&#160;... and&#160;... what is that in the corner? A dead woman! Is it a horror movie, Finn?!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Finn:</td><td> Calm down. It is a great movie. Full of blood and suspense. It will be a thrill!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td>Oh. I don't like that, Finn! I really don't like that! I get really upset when I watch this sort of movie. My heart races&#160;... here, put your actual finger on my actual pulse&#160;... Here.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Finn:</td><td> Oh, OK, OK, sorry Feifei. Your heart is beating very fast. I didn't know you had a problem with horror movies. Let's go and watch a musical then.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> 'The Sound of Music'?</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Finn:</td><td> Go on then!</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Feifei:</td><td> That's much nicer! Bye.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Finn:</td><td> Bye.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="roles">Both:</td><td> (Singing) Doe, a deer, a female deer. Ray, a drop of golden sun&#160;...&#160;</td></tr>
