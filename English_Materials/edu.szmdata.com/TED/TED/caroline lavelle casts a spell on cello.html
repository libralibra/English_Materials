	<p>Thank you very much. Now, I've got a story for you. When I arrived off the plane, after a very long journey from the West of England, my computer, my beloved laptop, had gone mad, and had&#151;oh!&#151;a bit like that!&#151;and the display on it&#151;anyway, the whole thing had burst. And I went to the IT guys here and a gentleman mended my computer, and then he said, "What are you doing here?" and I said "I'm playing the cello and I'm doing a bit of singing," and he said, "Oh, I sort of play the cello as well." And I said, "Do you really?" Anyway, so you're in for a treat, because he's fantastic, and his name's Mark.</p>
	<p>(Applause)</p>
	<p>I am also joined by my partner in crime, Thomas Dolby.</p>
	<p>(Applause)</p>
	<p>This song is called "Farther than the Sun."</p>
	<p>(Music)</p>
	<p class="lyrics">Strung in the wind I called you</p>
	<p class="lyrics">but you did not hear&#160;...&#160;</p>
	<p class="lyrics">And you're a plant that needs poor soil</p>
	<p class="lyrics">and I have treated you too well</p>
	<p class="lyrics">to give up flowers&#160;...&#160;</p>
	<p class="lyrics">Oh, I have been too rich for you&#160;...&#160;</p>
	<p class="lyrics">Farther than the sun from me</p>
	<p class="lyrics">Farther than I'd have you be</p>
	<p class="lyrics">And I go north, I get so cold</p>
	<p class="lyrics">My heart is lava under stone</p>
	<p class="lyrics">You are not worthy</p>
	<p class="lyrics">You are not worthy&#160;...&#160;</p>
	<p class="lyrics">With your calculating eyes</p>
	<p class="lyrics">spinning figures</p>
	<p class="lyrics">you cannot see me</p>
	<p class="lyrics">You cannot see me&#160;...&#160;</p>
	<p class="lyrics">And if I tell myself enough</p>
	<p class="lyrics">I'll believe it</p>
	<p class="lyrics">You are not worthy</p>
	<p class="lyrics">The sea, it freezes over&#160;...&#160;</p>
	<p class="lyrics">to trap the light</p>
	<p class="lyrics">And I'm in love with being in love</p>
	<p class="lyrics">and you were never quite the one</p>
	<p class="lyrics">In Gerda's eyes</p>
	<p class="lyrics">Fragments of what you've become</p>
	<p class="lyrics">And all the moths that fly at night</p>
	<p class="lyrics">believe electric light is bright</p>
	<p class="lyrics">You are not worthy</p>
	<p class="lyrics">You are not worthy</p>
	<p class="lyrics">With your calculating eyes</p>
	<p class="lyrics">Spinning figures</p>
	<p class="lyrics">You cannot see me, no</p>
	<p class="lyrics">And if I tell myself enough</p>
	<p class="lyrics">I'll believe it</p>
	<p class="lyrics">You are not worthy</p>
	<p class="lyrics">Farther than the sun from me</p>
	<p class="lyrics">Farther than I'd have you be</p>
	<p class="lyrics">And I go north, I get so cold</p>
	<p class="lyrics">My heart is lava under stone</p>
	<p class="lyrics">You are not worthy</p>
	<p class="lyrics">You are not worthy</p>
	<p class="lyrics">With your calculating eyes</p>
	<p class="lyrics">Spinning figures</p>
	<p class="lyrics">You cannot see me, no&#160;...&#160;</p>
	<p class="lyrics">And if I tell myself enough, I'll believe it</p>
	<p>(Applause)</p>
	<p>Thank you very much.</p>
