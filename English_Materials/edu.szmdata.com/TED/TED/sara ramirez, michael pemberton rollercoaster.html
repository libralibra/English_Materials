	<p>(Guitar) </p>
	<p>(Singing) </p>
	<p>Rollercoaster, carousel. </p>
	<p>Where the highs are heaven, but the lows, oh, they can be hell. </p>
	<p>You can grab the ring, you can ring that bell, </p>
	<p>when the ride is over, you can never tell. </p>
	<p>People tell you this one thing&#151;will make your life complete. </p>
	<p>So you, you give it everything you got and you wind up on the street. Then one day you wake up, </p>
	<p>and they tell you "you're a queen," </p>
	<p>but then you find that someone else is pulling on the strings. </p>
	<p>Rollercoaster, carousel. </p>
	<p>Where the highs are heaven, but the lows, oh, they can be hell. </p>
	<p>You can grab the ring, you can ring that bell, </p>
	<p>when the ride is over, you can never tell. </p>
	<p>The one you love, they love you&#151;oh yeah&#151;until the end of time. </p>
	<p>But lose your edge or lose your cool, they will drop you like a dime. </p>
	<p>Everyone is crowding 'round when fortune is your friend. </p>
	<p>When your luck is running out, you're all alone again. </p>
	<p>Rollercoaster, carousel. </p>
	<p>Where the highs are heaven but the lows, oh, they can be hell. </p>
	<p>You can grab the ring, you can ring that bell, when the ride is over you can never tell. </p>
	<p>Well, maybe I'm just cynical, and all these words are lies, </p>
	<p>but experience keeps telling me that the cautious one is wise. </p>
	<p>But caution makes you hesitate, and hesitate you're lost, </p>
	<p>so take your opportunities and never count the cost. </p>
	<p>Rollercoaster, carousel. Where the highs are heaven, but the lows, oh, they can be hell. </p>
	<p>You can grab the ring, you can ring that bell, </p>
	<p>when the ride is over&#151;over, over, you can never, ever tell. </p>
	<p>Rollercoaster, carousel, rollercoaster, yeah, yeah, yeah, carousel. Carousel, carousel, carousel, carousel. </p>
	<p>(Applause) </p>
	<p>Michael Pemberton. </p>
	<p>(Applause) </p>
	<p>Thank you so much. </p>
	<p>Thank you. </p>
