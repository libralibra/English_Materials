	<p class="storyTitleTed">eddi reader on "what you've got"</p>
	<p>This song is one of Thomas' favorites, called "What You Do with What You've Got."</p>
	<p class="lyrics">You must know someone like him</p>
	<p class="lyrics">He was tall and strong and lean</p>
	<p class="lyrics">With a body like a greyhound</p>
	<p class="lyrics">and a mind so sharp and keen</p>
	<p class="lyrics">But his heart, just like laurel</p>
	<p class="lyrics">grew twisted around itself</p>
	<p class="lyrics">Till almost everything he did</p>
	<p class="lyrics">brought pain to someone else</p>
	<p class="lyrics">It's not just what you're born with</p>
	<p class="lyrics">It's what you choose to bear</p>
	<p class="lyrics">It's not how big your share is</p>
	<p class="lyrics">It's how much you can share</p>
	<p class="lyrics">It's not the fights you dreamed of</p>
	<p class="lyrics">It's those you really fought</p>
	<p class="lyrics">It's not what you've been given</p>
	<p class="lyrics">It's what you do with what you've got</p>
	<p class="lyrics">What's the use of two strong legs</p>
	<p class="lyrics">if you only run away?</p>
	<p class="lyrics">And what's the use of the finest voice</p>
	<p class="lyrics">if you've nothing good to say?</p>
	<p class="lyrics">What's the use of strength and muscle</p>
	<p class="lyrics">if you only push and shove?</p>
	<p class="lyrics">And what's the use of two good ears</p>
	<p class="lyrics">if you can't hear those you love?</p>
	<p class="lyrics">What's the use of two strong legs</p>
	<p class="lyrics">if you only run away?</p>
	<p class="lyrics">And what's the use of the finest voice</p>
	<p class="lyrics">if you've nothing good to say?</p>
	<p class="lyrics">What's the use of strength and muscle</p>
	<p class="lyrics">if you only push and shove?</p>
	<p class="lyrics">And what's the use of two good ears</p>
	<p class="lyrics">if you can't hear those you love?</p>
	<p class="lyrics">Between those who use their neighbors</p>
	<p class="lyrics">and those who use the cane</p>
	<p class="lyrics">Between those in constant power</p>
	<p class="lyrics">and those in constant pain</p>
	<p class="lyrics">Between those who run to glory</p>
	<p class="lyrics">and those who cannot run</p>
	<p class="lyrics">Tell me which ones are the cripples</p>
	<p class="lyrics">and which ones touch the sun</p>
	<p class="lyrics">Which ones touch the sun</p>
	<p class="lyrics">Which ones touch the sun</p>
	<p>(Applause) Thank you very much.</p>
