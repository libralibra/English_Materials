	<p>Has anyone ever been to Aspen, Colorado? It's not a joke yet; those aren't the jokes. Is this thing off? I went to Aspen recently and stumbled into this song.</p>
	<p class="lyrics">Black men go to Aspen</p>
	<p class="lyrics">and rent colorful chalets.</p>
	<p class="lyrics">Giggle at the questions</p>
	<p class="lyrics">their mere presence seems to raise.</p>
	<p class="lyrics">Get taken for men</p>
	<p class="lyrics">we don't resemble in the least.</p>
	<p>"Are you&#160;...&#160;?" "No."</p>
	<p class="lyrics">It's a winter wonderland</p>
	<p class="lyrics">in the belly of the beast.</p>
	<p class="lyrics">And black men ski.</p>
	<p class="lyrics">Black men ski.</p>
	<p class="lyrics">Black men send back sushi</p>
	<p class="lyrics">with a scorned Yakuza's flair.</p>
	<p class="lyrics">We make postmodern art</p>
	<p class="lyrics">with bacon grease</p>
	<p class="lyrics">and hot combed hair.</p>
	<p class="lyrics">We secretly play Beethoven</p>
	<p class="lyrics">inside our bassmobiles.</p>
	<p class="lyrics">We can tell you how cool looks</p>
	<p class="lyrics">but cannot show you how it feels</p>
	<p class="lyrics">when black men ski.</p>
	<p class="lyrics">When black men ski.</p>
	<p class="lyrics">Black men now are students</p>
	<p class="lyrics">of gay sensibility.</p>
	<p class="lyrics">We wear ironic T-shirts</p>
	<p class="lyrics">drenched in code unknown to thee.</p>
	<p class="lyrics">We get baptized in Walden Pond</p>
	<p class="lyrics">amongst a searing mob</p>
	<p class="lyrics">because the cleansing blood of Jesus</p>
	<p class="lyrics">could not do a thorough job.</p>
	<p class="lyrics">Black men ski.</p>
	<p class="lyrics">Black men ski.</p>
	<p class="lyrics">Chinese guys can jump real high</p>
	<p class="lyrics">and Germans cook soul food.</p>
	<p class="lyrics">White boys rap and hippies nap</p>
	<p class="lyrics">their dreads up to look rude.</p>
	<p class="lyrics">Jazz is now suburban</p>
	<p class="lyrics">it's Marsalisly clean.</p>
	<p class="lyrics">And now we've got Viagra</p>
	<p class="lyrics">everyone's a sex machine.</p>
	<p class="lyrics">So black men ski.</p>
	<p>What else can we do?</p>
	<p class="lyrics">Black men ski.</p>
	<p class="lyrics">Black men ski.</p>
	<p class="lyrics">Black men ski.</p>
	<p class="lyrics">Some kids I'll describe as friends</p>
	<p class="lyrics">say I am race-obsessed.</p>
	<p class="lyrics">The luxury of your opinion</p>
	<p class="lyrics">shows that you are blessed.</p>
	<p class="lyrics">See, I have poems about sunsets</p>
	<p class="lyrics">flowers and the rain.</p>
	<p class="lyrics">I've read them to policemen</p>
	<p class="lyrics">but it was all in vain.</p>
	<p class="lyrics">So black men ski.</p>
	<p class="lyrics">Black men ski&#160;...&#160;</p>
	<p> elegantly.</p>
	<p class="lyrics">Black men ski.</p>
	<p class="lyrics">Black men ski.</p>
