	<p>I'd like to dedicate this next song to Carmelo, who was put to sleep a couple of days ago, because he got too old. But apparently he was a very nice dog and he always let the cat sleep in the dog bed.</p>
	<p class="lyrics">(Dog panting noise) Heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh.</p>
	<p class="lyrics">I'm just a'walking my dog, singing my song, strolling along.</p>
	<p class="lyrics">Yeah, it's just me and my dog, catching some sun. We can't go wrong.</p>
	<p class="lyrics">My life was lonely and blue.</p>
	<p class="lyrics">Yeah, I was sad as a sailor,</p>
	<p class="lyrics">I was an angry 'un too.</p>
	<p class="lyrics">Then there was you&#151;appeared when I was entangled with youth and fear,</p>
	<p class="lyrics">and nerves jingle jangled, vermouth and beer were getting me mangled up.</p>
	<p class="lyrics">But then I looked in your eyes</p>
	<p class="lyrics">and I was no more a failure.</p>
	<p class="lyrics">You looked so wacky and wise.</p>
	<p class="lyrics">And I said, "Lord, I'm happy, 'cause I'm just a'walking my dog,</p>
	<p class="lyrics">catching some sun. We can't go wrong."</p>
	<p class="lyrics">Yeah, it's just me and my dog, singing our song, strolling along.</p>
	<p class="lyrics">'Cause I don't care about your hating and your doubt,</p>
	<p class="lyrics">and I don't care what the politicians spout.</p>
	<p class="lyrics">If you need a companion, why, just go out to the pound,</p>
	<p class="lyrics">and find yourself a hound, and make that doggie proud,</p>
	<p class="lyrics">'cause that's what it's all about.</p>
	<p class="lyrics">(Dog panting noise) Heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh.</p>
	<p class="lyrics">My life was tragic and sad.</p>
	<p class="lyrics">I was the archetypal loser.</p>
	<p class="lyrics">I was a pageant gone bad.</p>
	<p class="lyrics">And then there was you&#151;on time, and wagging your tail</p>
	<p class="lyrics">in the cutest mime that you was in jail.</p>
	<p class="lyrics">I said, "Woof, be mine!" and you gave a wail and then</p>
	<p class="lyrics">I was no longer alone.</p>
	<p class="lyrics">And I was no more a boozer.</p>
	<p class="lyrics">We'll make the happiest home.</p>
	<p class="lyrics">And I said, "Lord, I'm happy, 'cause I'm just a'walking my dog,</p>
	<p class="lyrics">singing my song, strolling along."</p>
	<p class="lyrics">Yeah, it's just me and my dog, catching some sun. We can't go wrong,</p>
	<p class="lyrics">'cause I don't care about your hating and your doubt,</p>
	<p class="lyrics">and I don't care what the politicians spout.</p>
	<p class="lyrics">If you need a companion, why, just go out to the pound,</p>
	<p class="lyrics">and find yourself a hound, and make that doggie proud,</p>
	<p class="lyrics">'cause that's what it's all about,</p>
	<p class="lyrics">that's what it's all about,</p>
	<p class="lyrics">that's what it's all abou-BOW-WOW-WOW-WOW</p>
	<p class="lyrics">that's what it's all about.</p>
	<p class="lyrics">(Dog panting noise) Heh, heh, heh, heh, heh.</p>
	<p>Good dog!</p>
	<p>Thank you.</p>
