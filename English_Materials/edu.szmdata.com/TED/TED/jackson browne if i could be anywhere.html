	<p>(Applause)</p>
	<p>Thank you.</p>
	<p>(Music)</p>
	<p class="lyrics">Slide into the shimmering surface</p>
	<p class="lyrics">between two worlds.</p>
	<p class="lyrics">Standing at the center of time</p>
	<p class="lyrics">as it uncurls.</p>
	<p class="lyrics">Cutting through the veil of illusion.</p>
	<p class="lyrics">Moving beyond past conclusions.</p>
	<p class="lyrics">Wondering if all my doubt and confusion will clear.</p>
	<p class="lyrics">If I could be anywhere,</p>
	<p class="lyrics">if I could be anywhere,</p>
	<p class="lyrics">if I could be anywhere right now,</p>
	<p class="lyrics">I would want to be here.</p>
	<p class="lyrics">Searching for the future</p>
	<p class="lyrics">among the things we're throwing away.</p>
	<p class="lyrics">Trying to see the world</p>
	<p class="lyrics">through the junk we produce everyday.</p>
	<p class="lyrics">They say nothing lasts forever,</p>
	<p class="lyrics">but all the plastic ever made is still here.</p>
	<p class="lyrics">And no amount of closing our eyes</p>
	<p class="lyrics">will make it disappear.</p>
	<p class="lyrics">If I could be anywhere,</p>
	<p class="lyrics">if I could be anywhere,</p>
	<p class="lyrics">if I could be anywhere in history,</p>
	<p class="lyrics">I would want to be here.</p>
	<p class="lyrics">The Romans, the Spanish</p>
	<p class="lyrics">the British, the Dutch,</p>
	<p class="lyrics">American exceptionalism, so out of touch.</p>
	<p class="lyrics">The folly of empire repeating its course,</p>
	<p class="lyrics">imposing its will</p>
	<p class="lyrics">and ruling by force</p>
	<p class="lyrics">on and on through time.</p>
	<p class="lyrics">But the world can't take it very much longer.</p>
	<p class="lyrics">We're not going to make it</p>
	<p class="lyrics">unless we're smarter and stronger.</p>
	<p class="lyrics">The world is going to shake itself free of our greed</p>
	<p class="lyrics">somehow.</p>
	<p class="lyrics">If I could be anywhere,</p>
	<p class="lyrics">if I could be anywhere in time,</p>
	<p class="lyrics">if I could be anywhere and change things,</p>
	<p class="lyrics">it would have to be now.</p>
	<p class="lyrics">They say nothing last forever,</p>
	<p class="lyrics">but all the plastic ever made is still here.</p>
	<p class="lyrics">And no amount of closing our eyes</p>
	<p class="lyrics">will make it disappear.</p>
	<p class="lyrics">And the world can't take it</p>
	<p class="lyrics">very much longer.</p>
	<p class="lyrics">We're not going to make it</p>
	<p class="lyrics">unless we're smarter and stronger.</p>
	<p class="lyrics">The world's gonna shake itself free of our greed</p>
	<p class="lyrics">somehow.</p>
	<p class="lyrics">And the world can't take it, that you can see.</p>
	<p class="lyrics">If the oceans don't make it, neither will we.</p>
	<p class="lyrics">The world's gonna shake itself all the way free</p>
	<p class="lyrics">somehow.</p>
	<p class="lyrics">If I could be anywhere,</p>
	<p class="lyrics">if I could be anywhere in time,</p>
	<p class="lyrics">if I could be anywhere and change the outcome,</p>
	<p class="lyrics">it would have to be now.</p>
	<p>(Applause)</p>
	<p>Thank you.</p>
	<p>(Applause)</p>
