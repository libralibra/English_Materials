	<p>This is about a place in London called Kiteflyer's Hill where I used to go and spend hours going "When is he coming back? When is he coming back?" So this is another one dedicated to that guy&#160;... who I've got over. But this is "Kiteflyer's Hill." It's a beautiful song written by a guy called Martin Evan, actually, for me.</p>
	<p>Boo Hewerdine, Thomas Dolby, thank you very much for inviting me. It's been a blessing singing for you. Thank you very much.</p>
	<p class="lyrics">Do you remember when we used to go</p>
	<p class="lyrics">up to Kiteflyer's Hill?</p>
	<p class="lyrics">Those summer nights, so still</p>
	<p class="lyrics">with all of the city beneath us</p>
	<p class="lyrics">and all of our lives ahead</p>
	<p class="lyrics">before cruel and foolish words</p>
	<p class="lyrics">were cruelly and foolishly said</p>
	<p class="lyrics">Some nights I think of you</p>
	<p class="lyrics">and then I go up</p>
	<p class="lyrics">on Kiteflyer's Hill</p>
	<p class="lyrics">wrapped up against the winter chill</p>
	<p class="lyrics">And somewhere in the city beneath me</p>
	<p class="lyrics">you lie asleep in your bed</p>
	<p class="lyrics">and I wonder if ever just briefly</p>
	<p class="lyrics">do I creep in your dreams now and then</p>
	<p class="lyrics">Where are you now?</p>
	<p class="lyrics">My wild summer love</p>
	<p class="lyrics">Where are you now?</p>
	<p class="lyrics">Have the years been kind?</p>
	<p class="lyrics">And do you think of me sometimes</p>
	<p class="lyrics">up on Kiteflyer's Hill?</p>
	<p class="lyrics">Oh, I pray you one day will</p>
	<p class="lyrics">We won't say a word</p>
	<p class="lyrics">We won't need them</p>
	<p class="lyrics">Sometimes silence is best</p>
	<p class="lyrics">We'll just stand in the still of the evening</p>
	<p class="lyrics">and whisper farewell to loneliness</p>
	<p class="lyrics">Where are you now?</p>
	<p class="lyrics">My wild summer love</p>
	<p class="lyrics">Where are you now?</p>
	<p class="lyrics">Do you think of me sometimes?</p>
	<p class="lyrics">And do you ever make that climb?</p>
	<p class="lyrics">Where are you now?</p>
	<p class="lyrics">My wild summer love</p>
	<p class="lyrics">Where are you now?</p>
	<p class="lyrics">Have the years been kind?</p>
	<p class="lyrics">And do you ever make that climb</p>
	<p class="lyrics">up on Kiteflyer's Hill? Kiteflyer's&#160;...&#160;</p>
	<p class="lyrics">[French]</p>
	<p class="lyrics">Where are you? Where are you now?</p>
	<p class="lyrics">Where are you now?</p>
	<p class="lyrics">Kiteflyer's&#160;...&#160;</p>
	<p>(Applause)</p>
	<p>Gracias. Thank you very much.</p>
