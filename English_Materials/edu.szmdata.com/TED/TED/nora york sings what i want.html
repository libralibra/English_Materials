	<p class="storyTitleTed">nora york sings "what i want"</p>
	<p>I'd like to begin this song I wrote about ceaseless yearning and never-ending want with a poem of popular Petrarchan paradoxes by Sir Thomas Wyatt the Elder: "I find no peace, and all my war is done; I fear and hope, I burn and freeze like ice; I fly above the wind, and yet I cannot arise; And naught I have, and all the world I seize upon."</p>
	<p class="lyrics">I want what I can't have, need what I can't want</p>
	<p class="lyrics">Have what I don't have, what I want</p>
	<p class="lyrics">What I can't have, need what I can't want</p>
	<p class="lyrics">Have what I don't have, what I want</p>
	<p class="lyrics">What I can't have, need what I can't want</p>
	<p class="lyrics">Have what I don't have, what I want</p>
	<p class="lyrics">What I can't have, need what I can't want</p>
	<p class="lyrics">Have what I don't have, what I want</p>
	<p class="lyrics">What I can't have, need what I can't want</p>
	<p class="lyrics">Have but I don't have</p>
	<p class="lyrics">It feels like all I got is loss on a bad back</p>
	<p class="lyrics">Gone with the last train, honey don't you fret</p>
	<p class="lyrics">Every cloud has a silver lining</p>
	<p class="lyrics">Just a little rain, just a little rain, just a little rain</p>
	<p class="lyrics">I want what I can't have, need what I can't want</p>
	<p class="lyrics">Have what I don't have, what I want</p>
	<p class="lyrics">What I can't have, need what I can't want</p>
	<p class="lyrics">Have but I don't have</p>
	<p class="lyrics">My mind won't stop, and my heart says go</p>
	<p class="lyrics">Nobody knows how to hold me</p>
	<p class="lyrics">My mind won't stop, and my heart says,</p>
	<p class="lyrics">"Good things come to those who wait"</p>
	<p class="lyrics">And I can't stand in&#160;...&#160;</p>
	<p class="lyrics">I can't stand in line forever</p>
	<p class="lyrics">Stand the cold air</p>
	<p class="lyrics">Glad-handed</p>
	<p class="lyrics">Sick and tired of the "Later, maybe"</p>
	<p class="lyrics">Take it, fake it, take it, take-it-or-leave-it life</p>
	<p class="lyrics">And I gotta just tame it</p>
	<p class="lyrics">I gotta just name it</p>
	<p class="lyrics">I gotta just seize, so please, oh please, oh please, oh please</p>
	<p class="lyrics">Oh please me right, 'cause</p>
	<p class="lyrics">My mind won't stop</p>
	<p class="lyrics">And my heart says go</p>
	<p class="lyrics">Nobody knows how to hold me</p>
	<p class="lyrics">My mind won't stop&#151;and my heart says go-ooooo&#160;...&#160;</p>
	<p class="lyrics">Good things must be here&#151;yes, right here</p>
	<p class="lyrics">Here, right here, right here</p>
	<p class="lyrics">I won't live this life forever</p>
	<p class="lyrics">One time round is all the offer is</p>
	<p class="lyrics">Sick and tired of the "Later, maybe"</p>
	<p class="lyrics">Take it, fake it, make it, leave it life</p>
	<p class="lyrics">And I gotta just name it, I gotta just claim it</p>
	<p class="lyrics">I gotta just seize</p>
	<p class="lyrics">Oh please, oh please, oh please me right</p>
	<p class="lyrics">I want what I can't have, need what I can't want</p>
	<p class="lyrics">Have what I don't have, what I want</p>
	<p class="lyrics">What I can't have, need what I can't want</p>
	<p class="lyrics">Have but I don't have&#151;you know that</p>
	<p class="lyrics">My mind won't stop, and my heart says go</p>
	<p class="lyrics">Nobody knows how to hold me, no</p>
	<p class="lyrics">My mind won't stop, and my heart says go</p>
	<p class="lyrics">'Cause I want what I can't have, need what I can't want</p>
	<p class="lyrics">Have but I&#151;have what I want</p>
	<p class="lyrics">What I can't have, need what I can't want</p>
	<p class="lyrics">What I can't have, need what I can't want</p>
	<p class="lyrics">Have but I don't have, what I want</p>
	<p class="lyrics">What I can't have, need what I can't want</p>
	<p class="lyrics">Have what I don't have, what I want</p>
	<p class="lyrics">What I can't have, need what I can't want</p>
	<p class="lyrics">Have but I don't have, what I want</p>
	<p class="lyrics">What I can't have, need what I can't want</p>
	<p class="lyrics">Have but I don't have what I want</p>
	<p>(Applause)</p>
