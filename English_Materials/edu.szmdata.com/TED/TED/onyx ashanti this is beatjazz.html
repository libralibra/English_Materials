	<p>(Music)</p>
	<p>Text: BeatJazz. BeatJazz is: 1. Live looping, 2. Jazz improvisation And 3. "Gestural" sound design. Accelerometers on each hand read hand position. The color of the lights indicates which sound I am playing.</p>
	<p>Red = Drums, Blue = Bass, Green = Chords, Orange = Leads, Purple = Pads</p>
	<p>The mouthpiece consists of&#160;... a button, two guitar picks and lots of hot glue. The heads-up display is a smartphone that displays system parameters.</p>
	<p>Why? To atomize music culture so that ALL past, present and future genres can be studied and abstracted, live. And "BeatJazzers" become as common as D.J.'s. But mostly&#160;... to MAKE the future rather than wait for it.</p>
	<p>(Applause)</p>
