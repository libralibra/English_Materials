	<p class="storyTitleTed">lee mokobe a powerful poem about what it feels like to be transgender</p>
	<p>The first time I uttered a prayer was in a glass-stained cathedral.</p>
	<p>I was kneeling long after the congregation was on its feet,</p>
	<p>dip both hands into holy water,</p>
	<p>trace the trinity across my chest,</p>
	<p>my tiny body drooping like a question mark</p>
	<p>all over the wooden pew.</p>
	<p>I asked Jesus to fix me,</p>
	<p>and when he did not answer</p>
	<p>I befriended silence in the hopes that my sin would burn</p>
	<p>and salve my mouth would dissolve like sugar on tongue,</p>
	<p>but shame lingered as an aftertaste.</p>
	<p>And in an attempt to reintroduce me to sanctity,</p>
	<p>my mother told me of the miracle I was,</p>
	<p>said I could grow up to be anything I want.</p>
	<p>I decided to be a boy.</p>
	<p>It was cute.</p>
	<p>I had snapback, toothless grin,</p>
	<p>used skinned knees as street cred,</p>
	<p>played hide and seek with what was left of my goal.</p>
	<p>I was it.</p>
	<p>The winner to a game the other kids couldn't play,</p>
	<p>I was the mystery of an anatomy,</p>
	<p>a question asked but not answered,</p>
	<p>tightroping between awkward boy and apologetic girl,</p>
	<p>and when I turned 12, the boy phase wasn't deemed cute anymore.</p>
	<p>It was met with nostalgic aunts who missed seeing my knees in the shadow of skirts,</p>
	<p>who reminded me that my kind of attitude would never bring a husband home,</p>
	<p>that I exist for heterosexual marriage and child-bearing.</p>
	<p>And I swallowed their insults along with their slurs.</p>
	<p>Naturally, I did not come out of the closet.</p>
	<p>The kids at my school opened it without my permission.</p>
	<p>Called me by a name I did not recognize,</p>
	<p>said "lesbian,"</p>
	<p>but I was more boy than girl, more Ken than Barbie.</p>
	<p>It had nothing to do with hating my body,</p>
	<p>I just love it enough to let it go,</p>
	<p>I treat it like a house,</p>
	<p>and when your house is falling apart,</p>
	<p>you do not evacuate,</p>
	<p>you make it comfortable enough to house all your insides,</p>
	<p>you make it pretty enough to invite guests over,</p>
	<p>you make the floorboards strong enough to stand on.</p>
	<p>My mother fears I have named myself after fading things.</p>
	<p>As she counts the echoes left behind by Mya Hall, Leelah Alcorn, Blake Brockington.</p>
	<p>She fears that I'll die without a whisper,</p>
	<p>that I'll turn into "what a shame" conversations at the bus stop.</p>
	<p>She claims I have turned myself into a mausoleum,</p>
	<p>that I am a walking casket,</p>
	<p>news headlines have turned my identity into a spectacle,</p>
	<p>Bruce Jenner on everyone's lips while the brutality of living in this body</p>
	<p>becomes an asterisk at the bottom of equality pages.</p>
	<p>No one ever thinks of us as human</p>
	<p>because we are more ghost than flesh,</p>
	<p>because people fear that my gender expression is a trick,</p>
	<p>that it exists to be perverse,</p>
	<p>that it ensnares them without their consent,</p>
	<p>that my body is a feast for their eyes and hands</p>
	<p>and once they have fed off my queer,</p>
	<p>they'll regurgitate all the parts they did not like.</p>
	<p>They'll put me back into the closet, hang me with all the other skeletons.</p>
	<p>I will be the best attraction.</p>
	<p>Can you see how easy it is to talk people into coffins,</p>
	<p>to misspell their names on gravestones.</p>
	<p>And people still wonder why there are boys rotting,</p>
	<p>they go away in high school hallways</p>
	<p>they are afraid of becoming another hashtag in a second</p>
	<p>afraid of classroom discussions becoming like judgment day</p>
	<p>and now oncoming traffic is embracing more transgender children than parents.</p>
	<p>I wonder how long it will be</p>
	<p>before the trans suicide notes start to feel redundant,</p>
	<p>before we realize that our bodies become lessons about sin</p>
	<p>way before we learn how to love them.</p>
	<p>Like God didn't save all this breath and mercy,</p>
	<p>like my blood is not the wine that washed over Jesus' feet.</p>
	<p>My prayers are now getting stuck in my throat.</p>
	<p>Maybe I am finally fixed,</p>
	<p>maybe I just don't care,</p>
	<p>maybe God finally listened to my prayers.</p>
	<p>Thank you. (Applause)</p>
	</body>
