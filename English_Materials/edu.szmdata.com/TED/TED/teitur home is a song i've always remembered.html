	<p class="storyTitleTed">teitur home is a song i've always remembered</p>
	<p>(Guitar music)</p>
	<p>I was just thinking that I have been missing you way too long</p>
	<p>There's something inside this weary head</p>
	<p>that wants us to love just instead</p>
	<p>But I was just thinking, merely thinking</p>
	<p>I've got loads of pictures,</p>
	<p>I've got the one of you in that dancing dress</p>
	<p>But man I feel silly in that dim light</p>
	<p>Just after doing you by the sight of my Kodak delights,</p>
	<p>I am sinking, merely sinking</p>
	<p>I think about long distance rates instead of kissing you babe</p>
	<p>I'm a singer without a song</p>
	<p>If I wait for you longer</p>
	<p>my affection is stronger</p>
	<p>and I&#160;... I was just thinking, merely thinking</p>
	<p>that this boat is sinking</p>
	<p>I'm tired of postcards, especially the ones with cute dogs and cupids</p>
	<p>I'm tired of calling you and missing you and dreaming I slept with you</p>
	<p>Don't get me wrong I still desperately love you</p>
	<p>inside this weary head</p>
	<p>I just want us to love just instead</p>
	<p>But I was just thinking and thinking, merely thinking</p>
	<p>I think about long distance rates instead of kissing you babe</p>
	<p>and time is running me still</p>
	<p>If I wait for you longer</p>
	<p>my affection is stronger</p>
	<p>I&#160;... I was just thinking</p>
	<p>I&#160;... I was just thinking</p>
	<p>that I'm tired of calling you once a week</p>
	<p>thinking of long distance rates instead of kissing you</p>
	<p>So baby I'm sinking,</p>
	<p>merely sinking</p>
	<p>(Guitar music ends)</p>
	<p>(Applause)</p>
	<p>Thank you.</p>
	<p>Singing is sharing. When you sing, you have to know what you're talking about intimately, and you have to be willing to share this insight and give away a piece of yourself. I look for this intention to share in everything, and I ask: what are the intentions behind this architecture or this product or this restaurant or this meal? And if your intentions are to impress people or to get the big applause at the end, then you are taking, not giving.</p>
	<p>And this is a song that's about&#151;it's the kind of song that everyone has their version of. This song is called "Home," and it's sort of a "This is where I'm from, nice to meet you all," kind of song.</p>
	<p>(Laughter)</p>
	<p>(Applause)</p>
	<p>(Piano music)</p>
	<p>Home is the sound of birds early in the morning</p>
	<p>Home is a song I've always remembered</p>
	<p>Home is the memory of my first day in school</p>
	<p>Home is the books that I carry around</p>
	<p>Home is an alley in a faraway town</p>
	<p>Home is the places I've been and where I'd like to go</p>
	<p>Home</p>
	<p>I'm always gonna feel at home</p>
	<p>No matter where I may roam</p>
	<p>I'm always gonna find my way back home</p>
	<p>No matter how far I'm gone</p>
	<p>I'm always gonna feel this longing</p>
	<p>No matter where I might stay</p>
	<p>Home is a feather twirling in the air</p>
	<p>Home is flowers in a windowsill</p>
	<p>Home is all the things she said to me</p>
	<p>Home is a photo I never threw away</p>
	<p>Home is the smile on my face when I die</p>
	<p>Home is the taste of an apple pie</p>
	<p>I met a woman, she always lived in the same place</p>
	<p>And she said home is where you're born and raised</p>
	<p>And I met a man, he sat looking out to the sea</p>
	<p>And he said home is where you want to be</p>
	<p>I met a girl in some downtown bar</p>
	<p>And she said I'll have whatever he's having</p>
	<p>And I asked her how come we never met before?</p>
	<p>And she said all my life I've been trying</p>
	<p>to get a place of my own</p>
	<p>I'm always gonna feel at home</p>
	<p>No matter where I may roam</p>
	<p>Always gonna find my way back home</p>
	<p>No matter how far I'm gone</p>
	<p>I'm always gonna feel this longing</p>
	<p>No matter where I might stay</p>
	<p>(Piano music)</p>
	<p>(Piano music ends)</p>
	<p>(Applause)</p>
