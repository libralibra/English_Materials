	<p>But anyway, this is about the evils of science, so I think it's perfect.</p>
	<p class="lyrics">My oh my, walking by, who's the apple of my eye?</p>
	<p class="lyrics">Why, it's my very own Clonie.</p>
	<p class="lyrics">Oh, if I should stroll the hood, who knew I could look so good</p>
	<p class="lyrics">just talking on the phone to Clonie.</p>
	<p class="lyrics">We are pals, it's cool, 'cause we're not lonely,</p>
	<p class="lyrics">shallow gene pool is nothing to my only Clonie.</p>
	<p class="lyrics">Me and you, hustling through, holding on through thick and thin,</p>
	<p class="lyrics">just day by day, our DNA, so the Olson twins got nothing on us.</p>
	<p class="lyrics">We'll survive, side by side. Mother Nature, don't you call her phony, she's my Clonie.</p>
	<p class="lyrics">Was wealthy, but not healthy, had no one to dwell with me,</p>
	<p class="lyrics">so look who I got born&#151;Clonie.</p>
	<p class="lyrics">Far from broke, bored, rich folk, we don't need no natural yolk&#151;</p>
	<p class="lyrics">our babies come full-formed, Clonie.</p>
	<p class="lyrics">We'll be huggable, get a publicist</p>
	<p class="lyrics">and show them, be the most lovable thing since fucking Eminem.</p>
	<p class="lyrics">Oh my friend, multiply, we're a franchise, like Walt Disney or Hannibal Lecter.</p>
	<p class="lyrics">We can tell our cancer cells are more benign than old Phil Spector.</p>
	<p class="lyrics">We'll survive side by side, should have signed with Verve instead of Sony.</p>
	<p class="lyrics">You're my Clonie.</p>
	<p> "Oh Clonie, how I love you."</p>
	<p>"Ha, I'm the only person I ever loved."</p>
	<p class="lyrics">Gee, that's swell. I guess you're just my fatal attraction-ie. You're my Clonie.</p>
	<p>Thank you.</p>
	<p>(Applause)</p>
