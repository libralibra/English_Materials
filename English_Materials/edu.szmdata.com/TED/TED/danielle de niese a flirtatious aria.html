	<p>(Music)</p>
	<p class="lyrics">I don't understand myself,</p>
	<p class="lyrics">why they keep talking of love,</p>
	<p class="lyrics">if they come near me,</p>
	<p class="lyrics">if they look into my eyes and kiss my hand.</p>
	<p class="lyrics">I don't understand myself,</p>
	<p class="lyrics">why they talk of magic,</p>
	<p class="lyrics">that no one withstands,</p>
	<p class="lyrics">if he sees me, if he passes by.</p>
	<p class="lyrics">But if the red light is on</p>
	<p class="lyrics">in the middle of the night</p>
	<p class="lyrics">and everybody listens to my song,</p>
	<p class="lyrics">then it is plain to see.</p>
	<p class="lyrics">My lips, they give so fiery a kiss,</p>
	<p class="lyrics">my limbs, they are supple and white.</p>
	<p class="lyrics">It is written for me in the stars,</p>
	<p class="lyrics">thou shalt kiss, thou shalt love.</p>
	<p class="lyrics">My feet, they glide and float,</p>
	<p class="lyrics">my eyes, they lure and glow.</p>
	<p class="lyrics">And I dance as if entranced, 'cause I know,</p>
	<p class="lyrics">my lips give so fiery a kiss.</p>
	<p class="lyrics">In my veins,</p>
	<p class="lyrics">runs a dancer's blood,</p>
	<p class="lyrics">because my beautiful mother</p>
	<p class="lyrics">was the Queen of dance</p>
	<p class="lyrics">in the gilded Alcazar.</p>
	<p class="lyrics">She was so very beautiful,</p>
	<p class="lyrics">I often saw her in my dreams.</p>
	<p class="lyrics">If she beat the tambourine</p>
	<p class="lyrics">to her beguiling dance, all eyes were glowing admiringly.</p>
	<p class="lyrics">She reawakened in me,</p>
	<p class="lyrics">mine is the same lot.</p>
	<p class="lyrics">I dance like her at midnight</p>
	<p class="lyrics">and from deep within I feel:</p>
	<p class="lyrics">My lips, they give so fiery a kiss,</p>
	<p class="lyrics">my limbs, they are supple and white.</p>
	<p class="lyrics">It is written for me in the stars,</p>
	<p class="lyrics">thou shalt kiss, thou shalt love.</p>
	<p class="lyrics">And I dance as if entranced, 'cause I know,</p>
	<p class="lyrics">my lips give so fiery a kiss.</p>
	<p>(Applause)</p>
