	<p class="storyTitleTed">jamila lyiscott 3 ways to speak english</p>
	<p>Today, a baffled lady observed the shell where my soul dwells</p>
	<p>And announced that I'm "articulate"</p>
	<p>Which means that when it comes to enunciation and diction</p>
	<p>I don't even think of it</p>
	<p>‘Cause I'm "articulate"</p>
	<p>So when my professor asks a question</p>
	<p>And my answer is tainted with a connotation of urbanized suggestion</p>
	<p>There's no misdirected intention</p>
	<p>Pay attention</p>
	<p>‘Cause I'm "articulate"</p>
	<p>So when my father asks, "Wha' kinda ting is dis?"</p>
	<p>My "articulate" answer never goes amiss</p>
	<p>I say "father, this is the impending problem at hand"</p>
	<p>And when I'm on the block I switch it up just because I can</p>
	<p>So when my boy says, "What's good with you son?"</p>
	<p>I just say, "I jus' fall out wit dem people but I done!"</p>
	<p>And sometimes in class</p>
	<p>I might pause the intellectual sounding flow to ask</p>
	<p>"Yo! Why dese books neva be about my peoples"</p>
	<p>Yes, I have decided to treat all three of my languages as equals</p>
	<p>Because I'm "articulate"</p>
	<p>But who controls articulation?</p>
	<p>Because the English language is a multifaceted oration</p>
	<p>Subject to indefinite transformation</p>
	<p>Now you may think that it is ignorant to speak broken English</p>
	<p>But I'm here to tell you that even "articulate" Americans sound foolish to the British</p>
	<p>So when my Professor comes on the block and says, "Hello"</p>
	<p>I stop him and say "Noooo&#160;...&#160;</p>
	<p>You're being inarticulate&#160;... the proper way is to say ‘what's good'"</p>
	<p>Now you may think that's too hood, that's not cool</p>
	<p>But I'm here to tell you that even our language has rules</p>
	<p>So when Mommy mocks me and says "ya'll-be-madd-going-to-the-store"</p>
	<p>I say "Mommy, no, that sentence is not following the law</p>
	<p>Never does the word "madd" go before a present participle</p>
	<p>That's simply the principle of this English"</p>
	<p>If I had the vocal capacity I would sing this from every mountaintop,</p>
	<p>From every suburbia, and every hood</p>
	<p>‘Cause the only God of language is the one recorded in the Genesis</p>
	<p>Of this world saying "it is good"</p>
	<p>So I may not always come before you with excellency of speech</p>
	<p>But do not judge me by my language and assume</p>
	<p>That I'm too ignorant to teach</p>
	<p>‘Cause I speak three tongues</p>
	<p>One for each:</p>
	<p>Home, school and friends</p>
	<p>I'm a tri-lingual orator</p>
	<p>Sometimes I'm consistent with my language now</p>
	<p>Then switch it up so I don't bore later</p>
	<p>Sometimes I fight back two tongues</p>
	<p>While I use the other one in the classroom</p>
	<p>And when I mistakenly mix them up</p>
	<p>I feel crazy like&#160;... I'm cooking in the bathroom</p>
	<p>I know that I had to borrow your language because mines was stolen</p>
	<p>But you can't expect me to speak your history wholly while mines is broken</p>
	<p>These words are spoken</p>
	<p>By someone who is simply fed up with the Eurocentric ideals of this season</p>
	<p>And the reason I speak a composite version of your language</p>
	<p>Is because mines was raped away along with my history</p>
	<p>I speak broken English so the profusing gashes can remind us</p>
	<p>That our current state is not a mystery</p>
	<p>I'm so tired of the negative images that are driving my people mad</p>
	<p>So unless you've seen it rob a bank stop calling my hair bad</p>
	<p>I'm so sick of this nonsensical racial disparity</p>
	<p>So don't call it good unless your hair is known for donating to charity</p>
	<p>As much as has been raped away from our people</p>
	<p>How can you expect me to treat their imprint on your language</p>
	<p>As anything less than equal</p>
	<p>Let there be no confusion</p>
	<p>Let there be no hesitation</p>
	<p>This is not a promotion of ignorance</p>
	<p>This is a linguistic celebration</p>
	<p>That's why I put "tri-lingual" on my last job application</p>
	<p>I can help to diversify your consumer market is all I wanted them to know</p>
	<p>And when they call me for the interview I'll be more than happy to show that</p>
	<p>I can say:</p>
	<p>"What's good"</p>
	<p>"Whatagwan"</p>
	<p>And of course&#160;...&#160;"Hello"</p>
	<p>Because I'm "articulate"</p>
	<p>Thank you.</p>
	<p>(Applause)</p>
	</body>
