	<p>Ladies and gentlemen, the history of music and television on the Internet in three minutes. A TED medley&#151;a TEDley.</p>
	<p class="lyrics">It's nine o' clock on a Saturday</p>
	<p class="lyrics">The record store's closed for the night</p>
	<p class="lyrics">So I fire up the old iTunes music store</p>
	<p class="lyrics">And soon I am feelin' all right</p>
	<p class="lyrics">I know Steve Jobs can find me a melody</p>
	<p class="lyrics">With one dollar pricing that rocks</p>
	<p class="lyrics">I can type in the track and get album names back</p>
	<p class="lyrics">While still in my PJs and socks</p>
	<p class="lyrics">Sell us a song, you're the music man</p>
	<p class="lyrics">My iPod's still got 10 gigs to go</p>
	<p class="lyrics">Yes, we might prefer more compatibility</p>
	<p class="lyrics">But Steve likes to run the whole show</p>
	<p class="lyrics">I heard "Desperate Housewives" was great last night</p>
	<p class="lyrics">But I had a bad piece of cod</p>
	<p class="lyrics">As I threw up my meal, I thought, "It's no big deal"</p>
	<p class="lyrics">I'll watch it tonight on my 'Pod</p>
	<p class="lyrics">And now all of the networks are joining in</p>
	<p class="lyrics">Two bucks a show without ads</p>
	<p class="lyrics">It's a business those guys always wanted to try</p>
	<p class="lyrics">But only Steve Jobs had the 'nads</p>
	<p class="lyrics">They say we're young, don't watch TV</p>
	<p class="lyrics">They say the Internet is all we see</p>
	<p class="lyrics">But that's not true; they've got it wrong</p>
	<p class="lyrics">See, all our shows are just two minutes long</p>
	<p class="lyrics">Hey</p>
	<p class="lyrics">I got YouTube</p>
	<p class="lyrics">I got YouTube</p>
	<p>And now, ladies and gentlemen, a tribute to the Recording Industry Association of America&#151;the RIAA!</p>
	<p class="lyrics">Young man, you were surfin' along</p>
	<p class="lyrics">And then, young man, you downloaded a song</p>
	<p class="lyrics">And then, dumb man, copied it to your 'Pod</p>
	<p class="lyrics">Then a phone call came to tell you&#160;...&#160;</p>
	<p class="lyrics">You've just been sued by the R-I-A-A</p>
	<p class="lyrics">You've just been screwed by the R-I-A-A</p>
	<p class="lyrics">Their attorneys say you committed a crime</p>
	<p class="lyrics">And there'd better not be a next time</p>
	<p class="lyrics">They've lost their minds at the R-I-A-A</p>
	<p class="lyrics">Justice is blind at the R-I-A-A</p>
	<p class="lyrics">You're depriving the bands</p>
	<p class="lyrics">You are learning to steal</p>
	<p class="lyrics">You can't do whatever you feel</p>
	<p class="lyrics">CD sales have dropped every year</p>
	<p class="lyrics">They're not greedy, they're just quaking with fear</p>
	<p class="lyrics">Yes indeedy, what if their end is near</p>
	<p class="lyrics">And we download all our music</p>
	<p class="lyrics">Yeah, that would piss off the R-I-A-A</p>
	<p class="lyrics">No plastic discs from the R-I-A-A</p>
	<p class="lyrics">What a way to make friends</p>
	<p class="lyrics">It's a plan that can't fail</p>
	<p class="lyrics">All your customers off to jail</p>
	<p class="lyrics">Who'll be next for the R-I-A-A?</p>
	<p class="lyrics">What else is vexing the R-I-A-A?</p>
	<p class="lyrics">Maybe whistling a tune</p>
	<p class="lyrics">Maybe humming along</p>
	<p class="lyrics">Maybe mocking 'em in a song</p>
	</body>
