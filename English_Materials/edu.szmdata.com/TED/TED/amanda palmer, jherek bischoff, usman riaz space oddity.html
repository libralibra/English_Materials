	<p>Amanda Palmer (singing): Ground Control to Major Tom, </p>
	<p>Ground Control to Major Tom, </p>
	<p>Take your protein pills and put your helmet on. </p>
	<p>Al Gore: Ten, Nine, Eight, Seven, Six&#160;...&#160;</p>
	<p>AP: Ground Control to Major Tom, </p>
	<p>AG: Five, Four, Three, Two, One&#160;... AP: Commencing countdown, engines on. </p>
	<p>Check ignition and may God's love be with you. </p>
	<p>AG: Liftoff. </p>
	<p>AP: This is Ground Control to Major Tom, </p>
	<p>You've really made the grade </p>
	<p>And the papers want to know whose shirts you wear. </p>
	<p>Now it's time to leave the capsule if you dare. </p>
	<p>"This is Major Tom to Ground Control, </p>
	<p>I'm stepping through the door </p>
	<p>And I'm floating in a most peculiar way </p>
	<p>And the stars look very different today. </p>
	<p>For here am I floating round my tin can. </p>
	<p>Far above the world, </p>
	<p>Planet Earth is blue and there's nothing I can do." </p>
	<p>(Music) </p>
	<p>"Though I'm past 100,000 miles, </p>
	<p>I'm feeling very still, and I think my spaceship knows which way to go. </p>
	<p>Tell my wife I love her very much she knows." </p>
	<p>Ground Control to Major Tom, your circuit's dead, there's something wrong. </p>
	<p>Can you hear me, Major Tom? </p>
	<p>Can you hear me, Major Tom? </p>
	<p>Can you hear me, Major Tom? </p>
	<p>Can you&#160;...&#160;</p>
	<p>"Here am I floating round my tin can, far above the Moon. </p>
	<p>Planet Earth is blue and there's nothing I can do. </p>
	<p>(Music) </p>
	<p>["I'm not a prophet or a stone-age man, just a mortal with the potential of a superman&#160;... I'm living on." David Bowie, 1947-2016] </p>
	<p>(Applause) </p>
