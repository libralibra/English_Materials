	<p>(Applause)</p>
	<p>(Applause)</p>
	<p>(Music)</p>
	<p>(Applause)</p>
	<p>(Music)</p>
	<p>(Applause)</p>
	<p>Chris Anderson: You guys were amazing. That's amazing. (Applause) You just don't hear that every day.</p>
	<p>(Laughter)</p>
	<p>Usman, the official story is that you learned to play the guitar by watching Jimmy Page on YouTube.</p>
	<p>Usman Riaz: Yes, that was the first one. And then I&#151;That was the first thing I learned, and then I started progressing to other things. And I started watching Kaki King a lot, and she would always cite Preston Reed as a big influence, so then I started watching his videos, and it's very surreal right now to be&#151;</p>
	<p>(Laughter) (Applause)</p>
	<p>CA: Was that piece just now, that was one of his songs that you learned, or how did that happen?</p>
	<p>UR: I'd never learned it before, but he told me that we would be playing that on stage, so I was familiar with it, so that's why I had so much more fun learning it. And it finally happened, so&#160;...&#160;(Laughter)</p>
	<p>CA: Preston, from your point of view, I mean, you invented this like 20 years ago, right? How does it feel to see someone like this come along taking your art and doing so much with it?</p>
	<p>Preston Reed: It's mind-blowing, and I feel really proud, really honored. And he's a wonderful musician, so it's cool.</p>
	<p>(Laughter)</p>
	<p>CA: I guess, I don't think there is like a one-minute other piece you guys can do? Can you? Do you jam? Do you have anything else?</p>
	<p>PR: We haven't prepared anything.</p>
	<p>CA: There isn't. I'll tell you what. If you have another 30 or 40 seconds, and you have another 30 or 40 seconds, and we just see that, I just think&#151;I can feel it. We want to hear a little more. And if it goes horribly wrong, no worries.</p>
	<p>(Applause)</p>
	<p>(Laughter)</p>
