	<p> (Whistling) </p>
	<p>(Applause) </p>
	<p>Thank you. (Applause) Thank you very much. That was whistling. I'm trying to do this in English. What is a chubby, curly-haired guy from Holland&#151; why is he whistling? Well actually, I've [been] whistling since the age of four, about four. My dad was always whistling around the house, and I just thought that's part of communication in my family. So I whistled along with him. And actually, till I was 34, I always annoyed and irritated people with whistling, because, to be honest, my whistling is a kind of deviant behavior. I whistled alone. I whistled in the classroom. I whistled on [my] bike. I whistled everywhere. </p>
	<p>And I also whistled at a Christmas Eve party with my family-in-law. And they had some, in my opinion, terrible Christmas music. And when I hear music that I don't like, I try to make it better. So "Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer"&#151;you know it? (Whistling) But it can also sound like this. (Whistling) But during a Christmas party&#151; at dinner actually&#151;it's very annoying. So my sister-in-law asked me a few times, "Please stop whistling." And I just couldn't. And at one point&#151;and I had some wine, I have to admit that&#151; at one point I said, "If there was a contest, I would join." </p>
	<p>And two weeks later I received a text message: "You're going to America." (Laughter) So, okay, I'm going to America. I would love to, but why? So I immediately called her up, of course. She Googled, and she found this World Whistling Championship in America, of course. She didn't expect me to go there. And I would have lost my face. I don't know if that's correct English. But the Dutch people here will understand what I mean. (Laughter) I lost my face. (Applause) And she thought, "He will never go there." But actually I did. So I went to Louisburg, North Carolina, southeast United States, and I entered the world of whistling. And I also entered the world championship, and I won there in 2004. </p>
	<p>(Applause) </p>
	<p>That was great fun, of course. And to defend my title&#151; like judokas do and sportsmen&#151; I thought, well let's go back in 2005, and I won again. Then I couldn't participate for a few years. And in 2008 I entered again in Japan, Tokyo, and I won again. So what happened now is I'm standing here in Rotterdam, in the beautiful city, on a big stage, and I'm talking about whistling. And actually I earn my money whistling at the moment. So I quit my day job as a nurse. (Applause) And I try to live my dream&#151; well, actually, it was never my dream, but it sounds so good. </p>
	<p>(Laughter) </p>
	<p>Okay, I'm not the only one whistling here. You say, "Huh, what do you mean?" Well actually, you are going to whistle along. And then always the same thing happens: people are watching each other and think, "Oh, my God. Why? Can I go away?" No, you can't. Actually it's very simple. The track that I will whistle is called "FÃªte de la Belle." It's about 80 minutes long. No, no, no. It's four minutes long. And I want to first rehearse with you your whistling. So I whistle the tone. (Whistling) (Laughter) Sorry. I forgot one thing. You whistle the same tone as me. (Laughter) I heard a wide variety of tones. </p>
	<p>(Whistling) </p>
	<p>This is very promising. This is very promising. I'll ask the technicians to start the music. And if it's started, I just point where you whistle along, and we will see what happens. Oh, hah. I'm so sorry, technicians. (Laughter) I'm so used to that. I start it myself. Okay, here it is. </p>
	<p>(Laughter) </p>
	<p>(Music) </p>
	<p>(Whistling) </p>
	<p>Okay. </p>
	<p>(Whistling) </p>
	<p>It's easy, isn't it? </p>
	<p>(Whistling) </p>
	<p>Now comes the solo. I propose I do that myself. </p>
	<p>(Whistling) </p>
	<p>(Applause) </p>
	<p>Max Westerman: Geert Chatrou, the World Champion [of] Whistling. </p>
	<p>Geert Chatrou: Thank you. Thank you. </p>
