	<p>Chris Anderson: William, hi. Good to see you.</p>
	<p>William Kamkwamba: Thanks.</p>
	<p>CA: So, we've got a picture, I think? Where is this?</p>
	<p>WK: This is my home. This is where I live.</p>
	<p>CA: Where? What country?</p>
	<p>WK: In Malawi, Kasungu. In Kasungu. Yeah, Mala.</p>
	<p>CA: OK. Now, you're 19 now?</p>
	<p>WK: Yeah. I'm 19 years now.</p>
	<p>CA: Five years ago you had an idea. What was that?</p>
	<p>WK: I wanted to make a windmill.</p>
	<p>CA: A windmill?</p>
	<p>WK: Yeah.</p>
	<p>CA: What, to power&#151;for lighting and stuff?</p>
	<p>WK: Yeah.</p>
	<p>CA: So what did you do? How did you realize that?</p>
	<p>WK: After I dropped out of school, I went to library, and I read a book that would&#151;"Using Energy," and I get information about doing the mill. And I tried, and I made it.</p>
	<p>(Applause)</p>
	<p>CA: So you copied&#151;you exactly copied the design in the book.</p>
	<p>WK: Ah, no. I just&#151;</p>
	<p>CA: What happened?</p>
	<p>WK: In fact, a design of the windmill that was in the book, it has got four&#151;ah&#151;three blades, and mine has got four blades.</p>
	<p>CA: The book had three, yours had four.</p>
	<p>WK: Yeah.</p>
	<p>CA: And you made it out of what?</p>
	<p>WK: I made four blades, just because I want to increase power.</p>
	<p>CA: OK.</p>
	<p>WK: Yeah.</p>
	<p>CA: You tested three, and found that four worked better?</p>
	<p>WK: Yeah. I test.</p>
	<p>CA: And what did you make the windmill out of? What materials did you use?</p>
	<p>WK: I use a bicycle frame, and a pulley, and plastic pipe, what then pulls&#151;</p>
	<p>CA: Do we have a picture of that? Can we have the next slide?</p>
	<p>WK: Yeah. The windmill.</p>
	<p>CA: And so, and that windmill, what&#151;it worked?</p>
	<p>WK: When the wind blows, it rotates and generates.</p>
	<p>CA: How much electricity?</p>
	<p>WK: 12 watts.</p>
	<p>CA: And so, that lit a light for the house? How many lights?</p>
	<p>WK: Four bulbs and two radios.</p>
	<p>CA: Wow.</p>
	<p>WK: Yeah.</p>
	<p>(Applause) CA: Next slide&#151;so who's that?</p>
	<p>WK: This is my parents, holding the radio.</p>
	<p>CA: So what did they make of&#151;that you were 14, 15 at the time&#151;what did they make of this? They were impressed?</p>
	<p>WK: Yeah.</p>
	<p>CA: And so what's your&#151;what are you going to do with this?</p>
	<p>WK: Um&#151;</p>
	<p>CA: What do you&#151;I mean&#151;do you want to build another one?</p>
	<p>WK: Yeah, I want to build another one&#151;to pump water and irrigation for crops.</p>
	<p>CA: So this one would have to be bigger?</p>
	<p>WK: Yeah.</p>
	<p>CA: How big?</p>
	<p>WK: I think it will produce more than 20 the watts.</p>
	<p>CA: So that would produce irrigation for the entire village?</p>
	<p>WK: Yeah.</p>
	<p>CA: Wow. And so you're talking to people here at TED to get people who might be able to help in some way to realize this dream?</p>
	<p>WK: Yeah, if they can help me with materials, yeah.</p>
	<p>CA: And as you think of your life going forward, you're 19 now, do you picture continuing with this dream of working in energy?</p>
	<p>WK: Yeah. I'm still thinking to work on energy.</p>
	<p>CA: Wow. William, it's a real honor to have you at the TED conference. Thank you so much for coming.</p>
	<p>WK: Thank you.</p>
	<p>(Applause)</p>
