	<p>Okay.</p>
	<p class="lyrics">Strolling along in Central Park</p>
	<p class="lyrics">Everyone's out today</p>
	<p class="lyrics">The daisies and dogwoods are all in bloom</p>
	<p class="lyrics">Oh, what a glorious day</p>
	<p class="lyrics">For picnics and Frisbees and roller skaters,</p>
	<p class="lyrics">Friends and lovers and lonely sunbathers</p>
	<p class="lyrics">Everyone's out in merry Manhattan in January</p>
	<p>(Laughter) (Applause)</p>
	<p class="lyrics">I brought the iced tea;</p>
	<p class="lyrics">Did you bring the bug spray?</p>
	<p class="lyrics">The flies are the size of your head</p>
	<p class="lyrics">Next to the palm tree,</p>
	<p class="lyrics">Did you see the 'gators</p>
	<p class="lyrics">Looking happy and well fed?</p>
	<p class="lyrics">Everyone's out in merry Manhattan in January</p>
	<p>(Whistling)</p>
	<p>Everyone!</p>
	<p>(Whistling) (Laughter)</p>
	<p class="lyrics">My preacher said,</p>
	<p class="lyrics">Don't you worry</p>
	<p class="lyrics">The scientists have it all wrong</p>
	<p class="lyrics">And so, who cares it's winter here?</p>
	<p class="lyrics">And I have my halter-top on</p>
	<p class="lyrics">I have my halter-top on</p>
	<p class="lyrics">Everyone's out in merry Manhattan in January.</p>
	<p>(Applause)</p>
