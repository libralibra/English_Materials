	<p class="lyrics">Where do we go from here?</p>
	<p class="lyrics">How do we carry on?</p>
	<p class="lyrics">I can't get beyond the questions</p>
	<p class="lyrics">Clambering for the scraps</p>
	<p class="lyrics">in the shatter of us, collapsed</p>
	<p class="lyrics">It cuts me with every could have been</p>
	<p class="lyrics">Pain on pain on play, repeating</p>
	<p class="lyrics">With the backup, makeshift life in waiting</p>
	<p class="lyrics">Everybody says</p>
	<p class="lyrics">time heals everything</p>
	<p class="lyrics">What of the wretched hollow?</p>
	<p class="lyrics">The endless in between?</p>
	<p class="lyrics">Are we just going to wait it out?</p>
	<p class="lyrics">There is nothing to see here now</p>
	<p class="lyrics">Turning the sign around</p>
	<p class="lyrics">We're closed to the Earth 'til further notice</p>
	<p class="lyrics">A crumbling cliche case</p>
	<p class="lyrics">crumpled and puffy faced</p>
	<p class="lyrics">caught dead in the stare of a thousand miles</p>
	<p class="lyrics">All I want, only one street level miracle</p>
	<p class="lyrics">I'll be an out and out born again</p>
	<p class="lyrics">from none more cynical</p>
	<p class="lyrics">Everybody says</p>
	<p class="lyrics">that time heals everything</p>
	<p class="lyrics">But what of the wretched hollow?</p>
	<p class="lyrics">The endless in between?</p>
	<p class="lyrics">Are we just going to wait it out?</p>
	<p class="lyrics">And sit here cold?</p>
	<p class="lyrics">We will be long gone by then</p>
	<p class="lyrics">In lackluster</p>
	<p class="lyrics">In dust we lay around old magazines</p>
	<p class="lyrics">Fluorescent lighting sets the scene</p>
	<p class="lyrics">for all we could and should be being</p>
	<p class="lyrics">in the one life that we've got</p>
	<p class="lyrics">Everybody says</p>
	<p class="lyrics">time heals everything</p>
	<p class="lyrics">And what of the wretched hollow?</p>
	<p class="lyrics">The endless in between?</p>
	<p class="lyrics">Are we just going to wait it out?</p>
	<p class="lyrics">Just going to sweat it out?</p>
	<p class="lyrics">Just going to sweat it out?</p>
	<p class="lyrics">Wait it out</p>
	<p> (Applause)</p>
