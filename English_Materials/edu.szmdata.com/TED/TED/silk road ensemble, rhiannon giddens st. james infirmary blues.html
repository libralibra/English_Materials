	<p>(Music) </p>
	<p>I went down to St. James Infirmary </p>
	<p>To see my baby there </p>
	<p>She was lying on a long wooden table </p>
	<p>So cold, so still, so fair </p>
	<p>I went up to see the doctor </p>
	<p>"She's very low," he said </p>
	<p>I went back to see my baby </p>
	<p>Good God she's lying there dead </p>
	<p>I went down to old Joe's bar room </p>
	<p>On the corner of the square </p>
	<p>They were serving drinks as per usual </p>
	<p>And the usual crowd was there </p>
	<p>To my left stood Old Joe McKennedy </p>
	<p>His eyes were bloodshot red </p>
	<p>He turned to the crowd around him </p>
	<p>And these are the words he said </p>
	<p>"Let her go, let her go, God bless her </p>
	<p>Wherever she may be </p>
	<p>She can search this whole wide world all over </p>
	<p>But she'll never find another man like me </p>
	<p>She can search this whole wide world all over </p>
	<p>And she'll never find another man like me </p>
	<p>When I die, please God, bury me </p>
	<p>In my ten-dollar Stetson hat </p>
	<p>Put a twenty-dollar gold piece on my watch chain </p>
	<p>So my friends know I died standing pat </p>
	<p>Get six gamblers to carry my coffin </p>
	<p>And six choir girls to sing me a song </p>
	<p>Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon </p>
	<p>To raise hell as I go along </p>
	<p>Now that's the end of my story </p>
	<p>Let's have another round of booze </p>
	<p>And if anyone should ask you </p>
	<p>Just tell them I got the St. James Infirmary blues </p>
	<p>(Applause) </p>
	</body>
