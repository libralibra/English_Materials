	<p>(Music) Dannielle Hadley: Life in Pennsylvania means just that: life without the possibility of parole. For us lifers, as we call ourselves, our only chance for release is through commutation, which has only been granted to two women since 1989, close to 30 years ago. Our song, "This Is Not Our Home," it tells of our experiences while doing life without the possibility of parole.</p>
	<p>(Music)</p>
	<p>Brenda Watkins: I'm a woman.</p>
	<p>I'm a grandmother.</p>
	<p>I'm a daughter.</p>
	<p>I have a son.</p>
	<p>I'm not an angel.</p>
	<p>I'm not the devil.</p>
	<p>I came to jail</p>
	<p>when I was so young.</p>
	<p>I spend my time here</p>
	<p>inside these prison walls.</p>
	<p>Lost friends to death,</p>
	<p>saw some go home.</p>
	<p>Watch years pass,</p>
	<p>people come and go,</p>
	<p>while I do life without parole.</p>
	<p>I am a prisoner for the wrong I've done.</p>
	<p>I'm doing time here.</p>
	<p>This is not my home.</p>
	<p>Dream of freedom, hope for mercy.</p>
	<p>Will I see</p>
	<p>my family</p>
	<p>or die alone?</p>
	<p>As the years go by,</p>
	<p>I hold back my tears,</p>
	<p>because if I cry I'd give in to fear.</p>
	<p>I must be strong, have to hold on.</p>
	<p>Gotta get through</p>
	<p>another year.</p>
	<p>I am a prisoner for the wrong I've done.</p>
	<p>I'm doing time here. This is not my home.</p>
	<p>Dream of freedom, hope for mercy.</p>
	<p>Will I see</p>
	<p>my family</p>
	<p>or die alone?</p>
	<p>I'm not saying that I'm not guilty,</p>
	<p>I'm not saying that I shouldn't pay.</p>
	<p>All I'm asking is for forgiveness.</p>
	<p>Gotta have hope I'll be free someday.</p>
	<p>Is there a place for me</p>
	<p>in the world out there?</p>
	<p>Will they ever know or care that I'm chained?</p>
	<p>Is there redemption for the sin of my younger days?</p>
	<p>Because I've changed.</p>
	<p>Lord knows I've changed.</p>
	<p>I am a prisoner for the wrong I've done.</p>
	<p>I'm doing time here. This is not my home.</p>
	<p>Dream of freedom, hope for mercy.</p>
	<p>Will I see</p>
	<p>my family</p>
	<p>or die alone?</p>
	<p>Will I see</p>
	<p>my family</p>
	<p>or die alone?</p>
