	<p class="subTitle">Answers and Explanations</p>
	<p>The best answer to the first question is <i>b</i>, Charlie Brown is a comic strip character. This is a straightforward fact.</p>
	<p>Answers <i>a</i>, <i>c</i>, and <i>d</i> are wrong for these reasons:</p>
	<p>Answer a: Charlie Brown is a very realistic character. The facts of the paragraph bear this out.</p>
	<p>Answers c and d: No mention is made in the paragraph that Charlie Brown is an American dream or a fighting champion. The facts state otherwise.</p>
	<p>2. The best answer to the second question is <i>b</i>, the author wants to kill the Charlie Brown that is in all of us. This is made clear when the author states, "I am talking about the Charlie Brown that is in me and the Charlie Brown that is in you."</p>
	<p>Answers <i>a</i>, <i>c</i>, and <i>d</i> are wrong for these reasons:</p>
	<p>Answers a, c, and d: The author does not object to the comic strip character that sometimes plays the role of a baseball manager and that is liked by everybody. The author objects to what Charlie Brown represents.</p>
	<p>3. The best answer to the third question is <i>d</i>, the author wants to kill the negative image which Charlie Brown represents.</p>
	<p>Answers <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, and <i>c</i> are wrong for these reasons:</p>
	<p>Answer a: .If Charlie Brown represented a positive image, the author would certainly not object to it.</p>
	<p>Answers b and c: There are no facts in the paragraphs which support these answers.</p>
	<p>4. The fourth question asks for a solution to the negative image problem. The fourth sentence of the third paragraph supplies the fact which solves the problem: The way to get rid of a negative image is to convert it to a positive image.</p>
	<p>If you had difficulty answering these questions correctly, review the passage and questions. If, after that, you still do not understand the answers and explanations, check with your instructor before going on.</p>
