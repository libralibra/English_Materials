	<p class="bigTitle">PART ONE<br />UNDERSTANDING MAIN IDEA</p>
	<div class="previewBox">
		<p class="previewQuiz">Preview Quiz 1</p>
		<p>As a preview to what will be discussed in Part One, try to answer this question:</p>
		<p>What is the most important element in any paragraph?</p>
		<ol type="a">
			<li>An important message</li>
			<li>The main idea</li>
			<li>A strong opening</li>
		</ol>
		<p>Begin reading Part One to discover the correct answer.</p>
	</div>
	<p>The purpose of this booklet is to help you understand better what a main idea is and how to recognize the main idea in different kinds of paragraphs.</p>
	<p>Perhaps the best way to understand main idea is to think of it as the central idea, or the most important idea, in a paragraph. Simply stated, if there is no main idea in a paragraph, there is no paragraph. For example, the core is the most important part of an apple for it is the center around which the fruit grows. A candle provides a similar example. At its center is a wick without which there is no candle, just a lump of wax.</p>
	<p>The same holds true for a paragraph. One sentence in a paragraph expresses the main idea; the other sentences explain, develop, or support it. If the main idea is eliminated, the paragraph loses purpose and direction; it is no longer a paragraph.</p>
	<p>The main idea, therefore, is the most important idea and it gives the paragraph purpose and direction.</p>
	<p>Every well-written paragraph has purpose and direction. The purpose may be to inform, define, explain, give directions, narrate an event, persuade, compare, contrast, etc. Its direction is usually single-minded: it seeks to focus on the main idea.</p>
	<p>It is not necessary to memorize this definition. It is important, however, that you develop a general understanding of these concepts and transfer it to your reading and study.</p>
