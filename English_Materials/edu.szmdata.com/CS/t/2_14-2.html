	<p>Roger Sullivan is an air traffic controller at one of the nation's largest airports. His is a tedious, tension-packed job because it means directing hundreds of jet aircraft to safe landings and take-offs every day. But the tensions have never troubled Sullivan as much as how to relax&#151;to completely unwind&#151;at the end of a busy day. He has tried bowling and bicycling, chess, sauna and hypnosis to list a few amusements. But the problem was never really solved until he bought a boat. However, it wasn't an ordinary boat for fishing, cruising, skiing, racing or the usual water sports. Instead it was a single platform mounted on parallel pontoons with an awning on top for shade and a small outboard for power. Now, several times each week, Sullivan drives directly from the airport to where the boat is moored and his wife is waiting. Then after a short cruise to a secluded bay, they cook dinner on board.</p>
	<p class="stems">Q. Sullivan's search for a hobby suggests he is the active, outdoor type. Underline the sentence which in your judgment suggests this.</p>
