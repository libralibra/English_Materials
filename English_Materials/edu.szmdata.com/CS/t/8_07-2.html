	<p>For more than a hundred years, F.A.O. Schwarz has been billed as the largest and most exclusive toy store in the world. Schwarz has built its fame on unique toys and excellent service to the public. The main store is located on Fifth Avenue in New York City. It is considered a showplace. Displays of unique, often foreign, toys create a magic "toy world" for people of all ages. All items are displayed so that they are easy to inspect. In fact, handling the toys is allowed. Schwarz has 16 branches in other cities in the United States and a large mail-order service. The annual catalogs of toys and other items are sent to almost two million people. About one-third of the people who receive these catalogs have visited a Schwarz store.</p>
