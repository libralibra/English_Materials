	<p>In 1909, an elderly woman of Flaxman Island went out to gather wood half a mile from her house. She was wearing only a coat-shirt, hair side turned in. Suddenly, a blizzard descended and she had to wait the storm out. Many Eskimos would have built themselves a shelter. Instead the old woman placed her mittens on a mound of snow and sat down, using them as insulation to keep her body heat from melting the snow beneath her. Her jacket was so designed that she could slip her bare arms out of the sleeves and cross them inside the coat. With her back to the wind, she settled down to wait the gale out. Every now and then, she walked around in a small circle. When she tired of this, she sat down again and tried to sleep. The next day, the gale subsided, and she walked home.</p>
	<p class="stems">Q. Underline the sentence which suggests that Eskimos prefer not to travel in a snow storm.</p>
