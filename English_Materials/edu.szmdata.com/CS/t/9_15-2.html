	<p>There are several weaknesses that W.E.B. DuBois saw in the thinking of Booker T. Washington. For one thing, he could not see how it could be possible for Blacks to exchange political progress for economic progress, as Washington suggested. DuBois reasoned that, without political power, Blacks could not gain economic power. For another, he could not agree with Washington that Blacks could gain in the long run by giving up on civil rights. DuBois could not understand how a people without equal rights under the law could have the self-respect and habits of thrift that Washington taught that the people of his race should develop. Finally, he flatly rejected the teaching of Washington that Blacks should not reach out for higher education but rather should seek out trade schools where they could learn a skill. DuBois argued that such a course would in time leave the Black community without any professional people whatsoever.</p>
	<p class="stems">Q. Underline a sentence which offers the reason why Blacks should net seek out trade schools exclusively.</p>
