	<p>One of Italy's foremost shapers of automotive style is, the legendary Turin firm of Pininfarina. The company employs more than 1400 persons and provides the coach work for 130 vehicles each day.</p>
	<p>Pininfarina's quietly elegant touch has helped shape automobiles ranging from United States production models to one-of-a-kind limousines produced for Popes and for European royalty.</p>

Introduced at the Geneva Motor Show in 1969, the Sigma Grand Prix has an anti-shock frame, rubber and nylon fire resistant fuel tanks, a new type of safety belts, and a built-in fire extinguishing system with automatic crash sensors.</p>
