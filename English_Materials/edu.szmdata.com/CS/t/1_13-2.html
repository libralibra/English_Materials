	<p>The Cherokee Indians, who considered themselves the "real people", established their villages along the streams and rivers of what are now the Carolinas, Georgia, Virginia, and Kentucky. The building methods used by the Cherokee people reveal a unique civilization. The walls of their houses were constructed with large, sturdy posts planted at three-foot intervals. Smaller posts were used to fill in the intervening spaces. The posts were held in place by twigs and long grasses interwoven to provide strength and protection.
