	<p>In the beginning the penalty for smuggling food into the ghetto was six months in jail. Later the authorities increased it to ten thousand zlotys and one year in jail. Then an order was issued making death the penalty for leaving the ghetto without authorization. Since most forms of smuggling required periodic visits outside the ghetto, this was a severe blow. Many were shot. Children used to sneak over to the "free" side by digging holes under the walls or by hiding near the ghetto gates and sneaking through when the guard momentarily turned his back. Then they would make their way to an apartment, timidly knock on the door, and with eloquent eyes, beg for food. Occasionally, they would get a crust of bread or a few potatoes. With their hard-earned treasure they would crawl back through breaks or chinks in the ghetto barrier. Parents would sit home all day nervously awaiting the return of their children. In tears they would gulp down the morsels of food.</p>
	<p class="stems">Q. Underline the sentence which suggests that some people on the "free" side objected to the ghetto policy.</p>
