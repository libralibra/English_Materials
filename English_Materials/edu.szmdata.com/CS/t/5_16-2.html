	<p>Jamestown, Virginia, grew out of the dreams of Sir Humphrey Gilbert. On June 11, 1578, Gilbert obtained from Queen Elizabeth a charter to discover and colonize "remote heathen and barbarous lands". In 1583, he ventured almost his entire fortune and that of his wife in an attempt to explore the northern part of North America. The Queen herself gave Gilbert a good-luck token. Gilbert landed at St. John's, Newfoundland, and claimed it for England. But on coasting southward, he met with repeated misfortunes, turned away, and was drowned on the return voyage to England. He had insisted on sailing in one of his smaller ships, saying, "I will not forsake my company." Among his last recorded words was the famous cry to his men in the larger ship, "We are as near to heaven by sea as by land."</p>
	<p class="stems">Q. Underline the sentence which suggests that Gilbert felt confident of success.</p>
