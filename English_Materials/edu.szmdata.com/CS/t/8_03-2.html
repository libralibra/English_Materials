	<p>Before the Indians had horses, they used a "surround hunt", or drive, to get game. The Hopi, for example, hunted antelope in this way. They chose a place partly fenced in by hills and with trees nearby. There they built a corral of strong tree trunks with one opening. From this, long wings led out, fenced with brush for some distances. Men stood along these wings to scare the antelope so that they would not try to leap the brush but would gallop down the open space into the corral. When a herd was nearby, the boys of the village were sent to round them up. They got behind the animals, and made a fire to frighten them. Then the boys closed in around them, howling like wolves to make them run toward the corral. When the antelope had entered it, the opening was closed with brush. Good marksmen could then easily shoot them as they milled around.</p>
	<p class="stems">Q. Underline the sentence which makes clear the Hopi's intent to use the antelope as food.</p>
