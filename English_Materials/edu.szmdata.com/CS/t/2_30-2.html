	<p>Present U.S. transportation problems began in the period following World War II. Suburban growth was booming and auto ownership increased rapidly. Expressways and interstate highways seemed the right answer. People simply stopped using public facilities. As less money was collected at the fare box, public transit systems started digging their own graves. Whenever they were spending more than they were making, they raised fares and cut back services.

By 1970, losses approached 220 million dollars a year.</p>
