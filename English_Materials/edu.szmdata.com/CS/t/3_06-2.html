	<p>"But I&#151;I'd have given you everything, I'd have sold everything, worked my fingers to the bone, begged in the streets, just for a smile from you, for a look, just to hear you say 'Thank you.' And you sit there calmly in your chair, as though you hadn't made me suffer enough already! If it hadn't been for you I could have been happy! What made you do it? Was it a bet? You loved me, though: you used to say so&#160;...&#160;And you said so again just now. Ah, you'd have done better to throw me out! My hands are still hot from your kisses; and right there on the rug you swore on your knees that you'd love me forever. You made me believe it: for two years you led me on in a wonderful, marvelous dream&#160;...&#160;! Our plans for going away&#151;you remember? Oh! That letter you wrote me! It tore my heart in two! And now when I come back to him&#151;and find him rich and happy and free&#151;to implore him for help that anybody would give me&#151;come in distress, bringing him all my love&#151;he refuses me, because it would cost him three thousand francs!"</p>
