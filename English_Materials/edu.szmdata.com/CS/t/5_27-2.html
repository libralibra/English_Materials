	<p>About the beginning of the century a Glasgow ship, the <i>Marlborough</i>, left New Zealand for England was last reported near the Straits of Magellan where she vanished. Almost a quarter of a century later, in 1925, the captain of a ship sailing off Tierra del Fuego at the very tip of South America, stared hard at the green sea. It appeared to him that a solid green filigree of great size released itself from the calm surface, rose rapidly upright, and came slowly toward him, Through his binoculars the startled skipper saw the shape of a three-masted ship. What was left of the sails was a brilliant green. The shrouds, the rigging, the decks, the superstructure, were all of the same bright green.</p>
	<p class="stems">Q. Two expressions suggest that the captain did not believe what he saw. Underline one of these expressions.</p>
