	<p>In the Creole life of old New Orleans, Christmas was a day for solemnity, religion, and family observances, and New Year's was the time for friendship. The holiday season reached its climax on <i>le jour de l'an</i>&#151;New Year's Day.</p>
	<p>The Santa Claus of the Creoles was Papa Noel, who looked like any other Santa yet had the extra graces of Gallic ancestors. Almost unknown was the traditional American Yuletide menu of turkey and cranberries. In New Orleans, Yule tables groaned not only with Creole dishes but with imported wines and preserved food from France. Christmas Day and the eve preceding were a time for religion, as Creoles dutifully attended church services, and it was a time for families. In early river and bayou towns the night before Christmas brought the <i>messe de minuit</i>&#151;Midnight Mass&#151;where all Latin Catholics of South Louisiana observed solemn moments.</p>
	<p class="stems">Q. Underline the sentence which contains facts explaining where many Louisiana Creoles lived.</p>
