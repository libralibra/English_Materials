	<p>Sister Jean climbed out of the truck which had stopped in front of a two-story, gray brick house exactly like all the other houses in the projects.</p>
	<p>"The kitchen chairs go to this family," she said. As the teenage boys with her started unloading the chairs, three barefoot children dashed out the front door.</p>
	<p>"It's Sister Jean!"</p>
	<p>"Hi, Sister Jean!"</p>
	<p>"Hi Sur Jean," three-year-old Betty shouted.</p>
	<p>While the boys carried in the chairs, Sister Jean and the children's mother stood chatting in the living room. It had no rug or curtains, and was furnished only with a couch with the stuffings falling out and a broken TV in the corner.</p>
	<p>"Mama, we can all sit down at the same time now!" eight-year-old Robbie exclaimed, sitting in a chair and jumping up again.</p>
