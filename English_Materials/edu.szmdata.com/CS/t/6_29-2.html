	<p>July 19, 1961, was C-Day at the Ohio Penitentiary. Thirty-three men stood in line ready to receive injections of live cancer cells. This experiment was part of a cancer study that could not be matched anywhere in the world. The 33 men who were injected with the live cancer cells were all serving sentences at the penitentiary. Among them were two who were in for murder, a number for armed robbery, a burglar or two, some forgers, a safe-cracker, and an automobile thief. In all, 204 men had participated in the research program since it was begun at the penitentiary in 1956. For seven of the 33, this was the second time around, having taken part in another phase of the program in 1959.</p>
