	<p>The old, gray railroad depot just ain't what it used to be in many places. Dozens of freight and passenger structures, which were built long ago, have outlived their purpose because of the death of many passenger train runs and the actions of freight agencies. What was the railroad depot is these days the local community center, actor's theater, small business office, or antique shop. For the last few years, local citizens of on-line towns have taken an interest in the old structures and put them back to good use.</p>
	<p>While a building's age is often thought of as a liability, when it comes to depots, the age of the structure lends nostalgic charm for the would-be purchaser. And as most buyers or leasers will tell you, an old depot makes a good advertisement for their business; it's easy to make it the "talk of town" especially in smaller communities.</p>
