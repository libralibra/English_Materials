	<p>The approaching jungle night was, in itself, a threat. As it deepened, an eerie silence enveloped the thatched village. People were silent. Tethered cattle stood quietly. Roosting chickens did not stir and wise goats made no noise. Thus it had been for countless centuries and thus it would continue to be. The brown-skinned people of the village knew the jungle. They had trodden its dim paths, forded its sulky rivers, borne its streaming heat and were familiar with its deer, tapir, crocodiles, screaming green parrots and countless other creatures.</p>
	<p>That was the daytime jungle they could see, feel, and hear, but at night everything became different. When darkness came, the jungle was alive with strange and horrible things which no man had ever seen and no man could describe. Because it was a time of the unknown, night had to be a time of fear.</p>
