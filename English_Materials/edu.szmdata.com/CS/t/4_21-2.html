	<p>"Buckle-up ... or else!" may become the new slogan of those who support safety belts. The life-saving value of safety belts has been firmly established by many studies. Most serious injuries and deaths resulting from even minor accidents are caused by people being thrown out of or against the interior of the vehicle. One study showed that 40 percent of those killed in auto accidents would have been saved if they had been wearing safety belts.</p>
	<p>Safety belts have been standard equipment on all automobiles sold in the United States since 1964. Since long before that, safety-minded organizations have been advocating that motor vehicle drivers and passengers make it a habit to use safety belts whether they are driving across the country or across town. Millions of dollars worth of public service advertising has been donated by newspapers, magazines, radio, and television&#151;to remind motorists and passengers to "buckle-up".</p>
	<p class="stems">Q. Underline the sentence which strongly reinforces the conclusion that drivers should buckle-up for their own safety.</p>
