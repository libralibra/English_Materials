	<p>After World War I countries were so hostile that many people tried to find some way that they could be friendly toward each other. To Fridtjof Nansen, the League of Nations was the answer. A new ship, he called it, "that sails on a new course with the future hopes of mankind on board." But it would need to be a new ship, built on new lines to outride the shock and pressures of the greed and pride of nations. The old ships, built of defensive alliances, balance of power, and secret treaties, had all foundered and sunk in the war. This ship must be something new. It must be built by all nations, small as well as large, the conquered as well as the conquerors, and it must be steered by the consent of all, and not by the few who were stronger.</p>
	<p class="stems">Q. Underline the sentence which shows that Nansen wrote optimistically about the League of Nations.</p>
