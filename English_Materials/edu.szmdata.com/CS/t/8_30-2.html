	<p>In some ways, the War between the North and the South, commonly referred to as the Civil War, resembled earlier wars. Soldiers used muzzle-loading rifles, just as they had in the American Revolution. Officers and cavalry troops rode horses, as they had done for centuries. On both sides, Union men and Confederates often showed respect and courtesy for one another. Northern and Southern officers often knew one another through common service in the United States Army. Many had trained together in the United States Military Academy at West Point. Enlisted men sometimes exchanged friendly greetings during the lulls between great battles. Across the trenches, they would trade "Rebel" tobacco for "Yankee" coffee and sugar.</p>
