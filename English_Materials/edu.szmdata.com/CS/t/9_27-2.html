	<p>The needs of the Navajo Indians are acute. Unemployment on the reservation approaches 70 percent. The average number of school years completed by Navajo adults over 25 is less than three years. Navajos average an annual income per family of $700. For this nation within a nation, the problem is one of survival. The situation is that desperate.</p>
	<p>But for the Navajos, desperation does not end with finding work, earning money, and being able to provide food, shelter and clothing. There's more to it. Theirs is also the desperation of a culture in danger of extinction.</p>
	<p>Over the years, the dominant culture confined and manipulated the Navajos, forcing Anglo values, attitudes, and life styles methodically upon them, to the slow destruction of their own. Families were broken up, children shipped off to boarding schools. States denied these people the right to vote. The government controlled their livestock production; missionaries dealt with them as pagans; and alcohol, the white man's curse, destroyed many who were unable to cope with this onslaught. While much of that is history, too much of that pattern still exists today.</p>
