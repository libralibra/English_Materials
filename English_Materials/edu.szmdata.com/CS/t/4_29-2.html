	<p>The image of the forester as a rugged woodsman riding guard on the National Forests is not an accurate picture today. Although outdoor work is still important, forestry today requires a combination of management, mathematics, engineering and human relations skills as well as professional forestry competence. At one time or another, a forester may specialize in timber management, range management, soil conservation, watershed protection, wildlife, forest recreation, fire control, and many similar tasks. A forester must develop many skills to help the nation meet its needs for forest products and uses today, while at the same time ensuring through multiple use and sustained yield that these products and uses will be available in the future.</p>
