	<p>They think they're mighty lucky that they're living and that it's Christmas again. They can't see that, we live on a dirty street in a dirty house among people who aren't much good. Johnny and the children can't see how pitiful it is that our neighbors have to make happiness out of this filth and dirt. My children must get out of this. But how? The money that we've saved isn't nearly enough.</p>
	<p>The McGaritys have money, but they are show-offs with it. The McGarity girl just yesterday stood out there in the street eating from a bag of candy while a ring of hungry children watched her. I saw those children looking at her and crying in their hearts, and when she couldn't eat any more, she threw tire rest down the sewer. Oh, yes, there is more to happiness than money.</p>
	<p>Miss Jackson who teaches at the Settlement House isn't rich, but she knows things. She understands people. Her eyes look straight into yours when she talks with you. Everybody else around here looks away because they're ashamed of their lives. I'd like to see the children be like Miss Jackson when they grow up.</p>
