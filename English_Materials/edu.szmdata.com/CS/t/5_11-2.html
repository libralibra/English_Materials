	<p>Weather routing is, simply, a method of planning a course of travel around and through bad weather. It is the shortest course, generally, in terms of both time and risk. It is an instrument of control and efficiency in navigation, a means to greater safety and speed.</p>
	<p>In recent years weather routing has been very much refined, yet as an idea, it is new. Men have long been helpless before the weather and, like other creatures, have withdrawn in fear and simply suffered catastrophe. Those most exposed suffered most, and these were mariners. But centuries of ill-tempered skies and quiet seas taught them both caution and courage. They understood the wind's message and faced with confidence or feared with reason the motions of the sea and sky.</p>
