	<p>The freeways in Los Angeles, California, are frequently the scenes of death and destruction. Nevertheless, the Los Angeles freeways are among the safest in the world. For one thing, they are carefully patrolled. There are 125 highway patrolmen on the freeways looking for violations. The violations that they look for especially are tailgating (following too closely), careless lane changing, going too slowly in the fast lane, speeding, and drunk driving. For these and other violations, 125 men give on the average of 120,000 tickets a year.</p>
	<p>The freeways are well engineered. There are four extra-wide lanes going in each direction. One is for high speeds, two for average speeds, and one for trucks and slow drivers. The freeways are carefully banked for high speeds. When you break into a curve, you feel the banking holding you on the road. They are well lighted also, and there are no steep grades or hills blocking visibility.</p>
	<p class="stems">Q. Underline a sentence which discusses the physical layout of the Los Angeles freeways.</p>
