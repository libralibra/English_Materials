	<p>Would you describe the furnishings of your home or apartment as spartan? If so, don't alibi with "furniture costs too much". Some soldiers and dependents at Fort Myer, Virginia, have proved that it doesn't take a lot of bread to decorate a room attractively. In fact, what they built in the Special Services Crafts Shop cost mere peanuts. They built a couch for $20 and a modular stand for $12. And for a few bucks they came up with chairs, corner tables and wall decorations.</p>
	<p>It all began when Fort Myer Special Services personnel decided to enter the 1971 Army Arts and Crafts competition with self-made home furnishings. Many of the participants were long on enthusiasm and short on experience but Craft Shop personnel pitched in with help when needed. Ceramics, woodworking, sculpture, plastics&#151;you name it and they worked with it.</p>
