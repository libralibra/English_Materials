	<p>U.S. demand for fuels is growing steadily, and could double by 1985. But domestic supply is lagging. Our oil production has peaked and is declining, and natural gas is already scarce in some sections of the country. Coal is in severe environmental trouble, construction of nuclear power plants is behind schedule, and any real help from synthetic fuels is ten to fifteen years away. So over the next decade the burden will fall heavily on oil and natural gas. And the available reserves of both have been declining as demand rises. Ironically the resources are there, in the ground, but we aren't finding and developing them nearly fast enough.</p>
