	<p>Although he was outwardly modest, Marty had his dreams. He would graduate from grammar school and was planning to go to high school in the fall. He was impatient to go to high school and to get into high-school track meets. He'd never been coached, and yet look how good he was! Think of how good he would be when he had some coaching! He'd be a streak of lightning, if ever there was one. He dreamed that he would be called the Human Streak of Lightning. And after high school there would be college, college track meets, and the Big Ten championship, and after that he would join an athletic club and run in track meets, and he would win a place on the Olympic team, and somewhere, in Paris or Rome or some European city, he would beat the best runners in the world, and, like Ty Cobb in baseball and Jess Willard in prize fighting, he'd be the world's greatest runner.</p>
	<p class="stems">Q. Underline the words in the paragraph which suggest that Marty kept his athletic dreams to himself.</p>
