	<p>Much publicity and discussion have, in recent years, surrounded various ways and special courses designed to help people increase their reading speed. So much depends on definition. Even among experts there is not complete agreement as to exactly what we mean when we speak of "reading" a page of print. For some, it is attention to, and interpretation of most of the words on the page. Others seem to mean simply "dealing with large groups of words by speeding through them and picking out highlights". Most reading experts stress the importance of increasing the level of <i>comprehension</i>&#151;the rate at which words and the ideas they stand for can be truly understood. They believe that there has been overemphasis on the "numbers game" of increasing the number of words a person can "run through" per minute.</p>
