	<p>For a first visit to Rome, some orientation is advisable. Perhaps the best bet for a first day is to take one of the many bus tours (roughly $5 and up) just to get acquainted with the overall pattern of the city. Another recommendation is a visit to the Museum of Roman Civilization in EUR, Mussolini's model city. Mere you can examine plaster mock-ups showing Rome in the time of the emperors, in medieval days and during the Renaissance, and be much better equipped to appreciate the Forum, the Colosseum and so on. The Metropolitana, Rome's ever-incomplete subway, does run to EUR and costs only 50 lire.</p>
