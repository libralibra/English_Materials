	<p>When work has accumulated to the point where you feel overwhelmed, you can take certain steps to expedite matters. First, list all the tasks that must be done and decide which requires immediate attention. Next, divide the work into separate piles so you can actually see them disappear as you work. You will avoid a feeling of depression if you can see concrete achievement. Last, assign each task a certain amount of time. If you are realistic and allow yourself a little extra time for each task, you will find that all the work will be done with time to spare and a sense of accomplishment will replace the anxiety you felt at first.</p>
