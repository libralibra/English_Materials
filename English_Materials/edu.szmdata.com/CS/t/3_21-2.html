	<p>No one could have guessed Norma Martin's age seeing her drive around town in the cream-colored convertible coupe. She drove carelessly; one hand resting casually on the wheel. Her lipstick matched her nails and blended with the color of her dress; rust polish with green, red and white, or brown, rose with pastel shades. She was perfect from her smart well-fitting sandals to her seemingly endless supply of hats. Her manner was perfect, too. She spoke in a tired, low-pitched voice, and she looked at the person she was addressing as though he were very, very far away. Every morning when she strolled in Osborne's Market, she created something of a sensation. The two boys who sold fruit and vegetables simply stared and even old Mr. Osborne who had, as he put it, "seen hundreds of them come and go", was impressed and suggested filet mignon or a nice rib roast, feeling vaguely that chopped round steak was out of the question.</p>
	<p class="stems">Q. On the lines below write three words from the paragraph which portray Norma Martin as a cool, indifferent person.</p>
