	<p>Freeways and streets often begin their careers with extra wide lanes. But as traffic becomes heavier and the pressure increases on highway officials to "do something" about the congestion, they may compromise and add part of a lane to the shoulder. Then they move the paint stripes over a few inches to create four lanes where three had been. It's much less expensive than bringing in heavy equipment to create a base for a new road, or digging away a hillside, or widening a bridge. And, it's quick.</p>
	<p>Unfortunately, narrower lanes increase the danger of sideswipe collisions. There's less room for driver mistakes or inattention, or the swaying of a car in a crosswind. It is possible for two cars to touch, even though the tires will be within their respective lanes.</p>
