	<p>The days of guesswork and sticky fingers are gone. Confectioners have solved the problem of identifying a chocolate's contents by shaping letters atop each piece. For example, a "V" represents vanilla, a large "C" chocolate butter cream, a small "c" cordial cherry, an "O" orange, a "P" pineapple, and an "R" raspberry cream. Besides the letter clue, the shape of a chocolate is also an indication of its contents. Creams are round, caramels square, and nougats oblong. The ability to interpret a few shapes and markings enables the chocolate lover to select his favorites with confidence.</p>
