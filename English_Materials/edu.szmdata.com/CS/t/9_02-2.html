	<p>The pygmy of Central Africa is traditionally a forest dweller. He considers the forest his own and resents any intrusion by outsiders. The men in the tribe are hunters. The women do the fishing, gather wild vegetables from the forest and do all the cooking. The children carry the water. There is no pottery in their culture, but they make bows and arrows and spears, do some basketry, and build thatched huts. They eat both raw and cooked meat and make fire by twirling sticks. They wear a short apron of bark or a girdle of leaves; they may paint their bodies in geometric designs, and the paint is never washed off. In fact, pygmies never wash.</p>
	<p class="stems">Q. Underline the sentence which contains three facts which clearly explain the role of women in pygmy society.</p>
