	<p>Can you imagine how difficult life would become if all supplies of paper suddenly disappeared? Banks and post offices, schools and colleges would be forced to close. Food manufacturers would be unable to pack or label their products. There would be no magazines, newspapers or books. And we would no longer be able to write to our friends and relations.</p>
	<p>Those would be only a few of the troubles of paperless world. Everywhere we turn we find paper. Without it our modern world would come to a standstill.
