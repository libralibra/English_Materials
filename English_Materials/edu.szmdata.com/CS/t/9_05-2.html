In this region is Africa's highest mountain, Kilimanjaro, and this area also includes the <i>veld</i> or grasslands of the Republic of South Africa. Central Africa consists of the Zambezi River basin and the adjoining highlands to the south. Victoria Falls is included in this area. Madagascar, an island in the Indian Ocean, is now known as the Malagasy Republic. The Congo Basin is a giant shallow saucer on the table top of tropical Africa. Marshes, swamps, and lakes are common there. West Africa runs from the Cameroon highlands to the upper Guinea coastal zone. The Upper Nile Basin is the shallow area between the Ethiopian highlands and the Darfur plateau in western Sudan. Some of Africa's greatest rivers lie in this region.
