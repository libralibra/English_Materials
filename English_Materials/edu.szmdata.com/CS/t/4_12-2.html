	<p>If it is true that man is drawn closer to his fellow man through adversity, then the greatest fraternity of misery in the world must be composed of commuters. Whether stuck in traffic on a Los Angeles freeway or imprisoned in a stalled train within the tunnels of New York's Grand Central Station, the commuter is a victim of circumstances, poor planning, and the decay of public services in the United States. In other parts of the world, the man who goes to work by car, bus, subway, or train fares no better.</p>
	<p>Must it be this way? Is there no help for the commuter? Is the breakdown of urban mechanisms so far advanced that the situation is hopeless? In most parts of the world, the answer seems to be, Yes. Hamburg, Germany, says emphatically, No!</p>
