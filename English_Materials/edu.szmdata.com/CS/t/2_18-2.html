	<p>Never underestimate the potential which clubs gain when they join forces! A good example of what can be accomplished through multiple club effort is the program conducted in the Canadian provinces of Ontario and Quebec. Several years ago, some of the clubs in that area joined together to put forth a tremendous overall effort in promoting bike safety in the various communities. After they swallowed their individual identities, they combined to form the Canadian National Capital Region Bicycle Safety Week campaign. It wasn't long before the great potential of this program became evident. In the very first year the program reached 21,000 youngsters. It provided them with bicycle inspections, bike skill tests, rodeo competitions and bicycle safety education. Now the program provides the same service to more than 50,000 boys and girls each year&#160;...&#160;a most significant achievement!</p>
