	<p>The male and female mosquito make an odd couple. The female is a vampire and lives on blood. The male is a vegetarian that sips nectar and plant juices. Females of different species choose different hosts on which to dine. Some feed exclusively on cattle, horses, birds, and other warm-blooded creatures. Some favor cold-blooded animals. Still others prefer man.</p>
	<p>While the female's menu varies, her bite remains the same. She drives her sharp, tubular snout through the skin, injects a fluid to keep the blood from clotting, and drinks her fill, which takes a minute or less. It is the fluid she injects that carries disease. After her blood meal, she rests while her eggs develop. She then looks for a moist or flooded place to lay them.</p>
	<p class="stems">Q. Underline the sentence which justifies the conclusion that mosquitoes should be destroyed.</p>
