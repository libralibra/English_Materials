	<p>One of the most amazing sea voyages on record was made by the arctic exploring ship <i>Resolute</i> between 1854 and 1855. <i>Resolute</i> was one of five British ships which became locked in the polar ice in the Arctic Ocean. She was abandoned on May 15, 1854, and her captain and crew, along with the crews of all the other ships, reached England safely before the end of the year.</p>
	<p>On September 15, 1855, Captain Buddington, sailed around a southern tip of Baffin Island in the American whaler George Henry. Suddenly he came upon a ship of unusual appearance. It failed to answer to give any signals. And when he approached and finally boarded her, no crew was visible. Captain Buddington had discovered the <i>Resolute</i>, as sound as ever. A little water had leaked into her hold, and most of the articles inside had been spoiled. During the 474 days which came between her abandonment and recovery, the <i>Resolute</i> had sailed two thousand miles by herself, and had gained world-wide fame.</p>
	<p class="stems">Q. Underline the sentence which suggests that many people knew the history of the <i>Resolute</i>.</p>
