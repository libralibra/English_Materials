	<p>By withdrawing the small savings I had tucked away in the bank, we were able to lease a small flat above a bakery in a poor part of town. As poverty was new to me, I loved being able to shop around for cheap bits of furniture, paint chairs and tables, make my own curtains, cook, wash, and iron just for two. George, however, was miserable. He had always been poor and had counted on something much better for his new bride. So, day after day he sat looking gloomy in our little parlor, reading the classified ads over and over, but not making any real attempt to improve the situation he hated so much. I thought it best to let him come to grips with the situation himself, for only he could motivate himself and change his attitude.</p>
	<p class="stems">Q. Underline the sentence in the paragraph which shows that George surrendered himself to his miserable situation.</p>
