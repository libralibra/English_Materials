	<p>Mrs. Dubose was stationed on her porch when we went by.</p>
	<p>"Where are you two going at this time of day?" she shouted. "Playing hooky, I suppose. I'll just call up the principal and tell him!" She put her hands on the wheels of her chair and executed a perfect right face.</p>
	<p>"Aw, it's Saturday, Mrs. Dubose," said Jem.</p>
	<p>"Makes no difference if it's Saturday," she said obscurely; "I wonder if your father knows where you are?"</p>
	<p>"Mrs. Dubose, we've been goin' to town by ourselves since we were this high." Jem placed his hand palm down about two feet above the sidewalk.</p>
	<p>"Don't you lie to me!" she yelled&#160;...&#160;</p>
	<p>Jem would say she must not be very sick, she hollered so.</p>
	<p>When the three of us came to her house, Atticus would sweep off his hat, wave gallantly to her and say, "Good evening, Mrs. Dubose! You look like a picture this evening".</p>
	<p>I never heard Atticus say like a picture of what. He would tell her the courthouse news, and would say he hoped with all his heart she'd have a good day tomorrow. He would return his hat to his head, swing me to his shoulders in her very presence, and we would go home in the twilight. It was times like these when I thought my father, who hated guns and had never been to any wars, was the bravest man who ever lived.</p>
