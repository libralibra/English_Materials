	<p>The Brooklyn I grew up in was the world. When we wanted to go fishing, we had the whole Atlantic to ourselves. We'd go to Sheepshead Bay, and for a dollar get a place on a fishing boat. Within an hour we'd have our haul of flounder. We had the Navy Yard, and whenever one of the battlewagons was tied up there, our schools arranged for us to visit it. We had the theater. When plays finished their Broadway runs, they crossed the East River to Fulton Street, their first stop on the road. Later, when we studied art at Manual Training High, our teacher took us to the Brooklyn Art Museum, and there we learned to appreciate what made a great painting great. The zoo at Prospect Park was our lab when we studied natural history, and we learned about plants and flowers not only from books but from the live exhibits at the Botanical Gardens.</p>
