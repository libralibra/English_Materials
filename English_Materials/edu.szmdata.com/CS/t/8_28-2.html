	<p>Vocational training has gone through many stages of development in American history. It was given to the children of the poor during the colonial period through the system of apprenticeship. Boys were bound out for a few years to a master, who agreed to teach them a trade and to look after their welfare. Often the agreement required that the apprentice be taught to read and write. With the advent of the academy, instruction was given for training in occupations. It was Benjamin Franklin's hope in planning his academy that young people should "learn those things that are likely to be most useful". He wanted emphasis to be placed on the professions which the young men wished to follow. Other academies were founded with similar purposes. Then came vocational training in high schools. A reason for the building of the first high school was that a parent wished to give his child an education which would prepare him for an active life and serve as a basis for a profession.</p>
	<p class="stems">Q. Underline the sentence which shows that Benjamin Franklin's Academy was an example for other academics to follow.</p>
