	<p>First of all I want to introduce myself: My name is Carmen. Some people call me Smiley. I try to act nice, but sometimes I just can't do it. Some people don't help me. In my school not everyone is nice. Some people in my school act tough with me and want to boss me around. I can't always fight because some people have older brothers and sisters who fight for them, and I don't. I have a cousin who is the only one I can count on to help me. But I try not to bother him, because I have to learn to stand up by myself to get along in life.</p>
	<p class="stems">Q. Underline in the paragraph the sentence which reveals Carmen's self-reliance.</p>
