	<p>In many respects, mud is the fabric of life. It has a multitude of practical everyday uses. Our seafood industry depends upon it. Used as cosmetics, mud baths make women's skin soft, smooth, and beautiful. Drug companies search the world over for mud and soil samples which contain molds that produce antibiotics. Mud is forced down drilling pipes in the oil industry to lubricate the hot drilling bits and remove chips of rock and dust.</p>
	<p>Perhaps the biggest use of mud has been in agriculture. As far back as man can remember, rich organic river mud has been used for farming. The Nile River Valley, often called the "Cradle of Civilization", grew out of the organic muds that overflowed the river's banks. Today "muck" farms produce a large amount of our vegetables and fruits; swamps are drained and the muds are turned to soils.</p>
