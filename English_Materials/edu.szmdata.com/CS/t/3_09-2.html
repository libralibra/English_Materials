	<p>In the far-back times all the wild beasts of the forest and prairie held a council to decide which of their company should comply with Man's request and become his friend.</p>
	<p>They sat about the council fire with folded arms and clamped lips and looked at the man with the cold of Winter Moons in their eyes. Not one of the animals wanted to give up his freedom.</p>
	<p>At last the man turned away and started with heavy feet and heavier heart down the trail.</p>
	<p>When he had gone but a few steps Shoo-nea, the little wild horse, circled the council fire and neighed loudly. Then he followed the man and called, "Master, wait for me. I have decided to become your friend."</p>
	<p class="stems">Q. Underline the sentence which illustrates the man's respect, for the council's decision.</p>
