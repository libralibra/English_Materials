	<p>As its name implies, the Jazzmobile is a vehicle that transports musicians like Duke Ellington, Gillespie, Charlie Mingus, and other top-ranking American jazz stylists to concert sites. Playing on school grounds, squares, cul-de-sacs&#151;anywhere a crowd can safely gather&#151;the musicians give over one hundred free concerts a summer in Harlem and Brooklyn's Bedford-Stuyvesant section.</p>
	<p>On a muggy August afternoon during the summer of 1971, Duke Ellington and several other musicians appeared at 117th Street and A. Philip Randolph Square in Harlem. Newspaper notices had alerted the community so that before Ellington had struck the first key, one hundred persons had surrounded the Jazzmobile. As Ellington played, the crowd grew.</p>
	<p>Besides providing open-air concerts, the Jazzmobile runs a workshop for several dozen young neighborhood musicians.</p>
	<p class="stems">Q. Underline the sentence which mentions the Jazzmobile's other purpose besides giving concerts.</p>
