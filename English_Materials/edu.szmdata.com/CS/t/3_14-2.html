	<p>They were perhaps four meters apart when, the girl stumbled and fell almost flat on her face. A sharp cry of pain was wrung out of her. She must have fallen right on the injured arm. Winston stopped short. The girl had risen to her knees. Her face had turned a milky yellow color against which her mouth stood out redder than ever. Her eyes were fixed on his, with an appealing expression that looked more like fear than pain.</p>
	<p>A curious emotion stirred in Winston's heart. In front of him was an enemy who, was trying to kill him; in front of him, also, was a human creature, in pain and perhaps with a broken bone. Already he had instinctively started forward to help her. In the moment when he had seen her fall on the bandaged arm, it had been as though he felt the pain in his own body.</p>
	<p>"You're hurt?" he said.</p>
	<p>"It's nothing. My arm. It'll be all right in a second."</p>
	<p>Julia spoke as though her heart were fluttering. She had certainly turned very pale.</p>
	<p class="stems">Q. Underline in the passage the sentence which reveals the conflict facing Winston.</p>
