	<p>Like good shepherds of the desert, the casino operators of Las Vegas tend their flocks, gently shearing away the wool without skinning the sheep itself. Tourists are Vegas' most precious commodity. They are even more valuable when they join in the games offered so profusely there. Casinos, therefore, have developed educational courses in gambling. These gambling classes have become increasingly popular at several established gaming houses. One of them, in fact, has a "gambling school", and gives its "graduates" a little diploma before ushering them into the cold, cruel world of keno, cards, and craps. Bob Ondo, a friendly instructor at the Mint Hotel school, explains, "What we want is for the people to enjoy themselves while they are here ... not to make money, necessarily, nor to lose a lot of money."</p>
