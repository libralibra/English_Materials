	<p>Some people live in strange places, but about the strangest of all is a town of fifteen hundred souls high up in the crater of an extinct volcano on the island of Saba in the Dutch West Indies. The island, quite barren on its slopes, rises steeply out of the ocean. To land on it is so hazardous few travelers care to take the risk. Another discouraging feature is the climb up the "Ladder", an almost vertical flight of stone steps eight hundred feet high. Once on the top, one is rewarded by the sight of a long V-shaped crevice in the shell of the volcano. It is through this opening that entry is made into the town. Up the sun-beaten path to the natural gateway the Sabans climb with their back-breaking loads of assorted objects&#151;lumber, seeds, provisions, furniture. Sometimes men and women porters make several round trips a day,</p>
