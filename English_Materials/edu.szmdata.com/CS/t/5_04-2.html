	<p>The telephone rang and I picked it up and the voice said, "Block party tonight." Right then, I knew summer had arrived in North Dakota.</p>
	<p>I'll tell you, there is nobody who enjoys summer more than North Dakotans, possibly because it takes such a long time getting here. We emerge from our cocoons blinking into the sun and ready to go. We take to summer like a chorus girl takes to diamonds. We flood to the parks and the swimming pools and the golf courses and the hiking trails and the lakes. You ask a dozen North Dakotans what summer means to them and you will get a dozen different answers.</p>
