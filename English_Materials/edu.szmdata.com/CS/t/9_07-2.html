	<p>Leadership in a Mexican-American community usually rests in the hands of various types of individuals from the middle and upper classes. One is the natural leader. He has personal magnetism and inspires others to follow him. A second is the "helpful" leader. He is likely to be much like the Negro "Uncle Tom" leader. A third leader is the Mexican consul. He appears to be a help in times of trouble, but he actually holds back the process of Americanization by encouraging the spirit of Mexicanismo. A fourth leader is the temporary political leader. He is the one who gets out a large neighborhood vote. Finally, there are the professional and business leaders. They have money, education, and respect of the Anglos, but they feel somewhat apart from the masses. In some form or other, these types of leaders may be found in many Mexican-American communities.</p>
