	<p>Not since the great growth years of the snowmobile has a sport or pleasure vehicle caught the public's fancy as much as the latest entry to the market, the all-terrain vehicle. It is thought that, industry-wide, 50,000 of the vehicles will be sold this year, and in three years the number could jump to 225,000. Industry spokesmen feel the market for all-terrain vehicles may be larger one day than that for snowmobiles, more than 450,000 of which were sold in a single year, because there is greater geographic appeal and the vehicles can be used year-round.</p>
	<p>There is a great deal of customer appeal to all-terrain vehicles. Flat out, over a smooth surface, they can do about 35 miles an hour. They can climb a 45-degree slope, ford a stream, and run on snow, ice, mud, or sand without difficulty. As a result, all-terrain vehicles have vast appeal for hunters and fishermen and for large numbers of people who enjoy just exploring previously inaccessible areas. They also have industrial uses in such places as railroad yards, scrip mines or vineyards.</p>
	<p class="stems">Q. Underline the sentence which contains facts which illustrate the tremendous adaptability of the all-terrain vehicle.</p>
