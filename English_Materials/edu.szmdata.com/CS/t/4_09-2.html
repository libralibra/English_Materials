	<p>Shy, wary and seldom seen, perhaps no creature in nature has suffered so much abuse as has the wise, perceptive raven. This magnificent bird has been the object of superstition for centuries. Even the mere sighting of a raven was believed an evil omen. If one alighted on a church or dwelling, it was taken as a certain sign of death or disaster.</p>
	<p>The regal raven was feared and hated by many. Ancient mythology is full of stories about the raven, but his presence was always regarded as a sign that sinister happenings would quickly follow. In the folklore of many countries, the raven is always mentioned as a bird of evil, and in certain areas of the United States, some people still hold this belief.</p>
