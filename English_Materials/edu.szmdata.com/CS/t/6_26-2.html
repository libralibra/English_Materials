	<p>Whenever I get a little depressed with the way the world's going, I like to read the prediction by some scientist describing what the world will be like in the future. The latest of these predictions, made by Dr. Wilton Krogman, has been a real comfort to me. I think Dr. Krogman deserves a great vote of thanks. According to him, the man of the future will transmit "thought waves" from a super-power brain, eat pre-digested food, and have roughly the shape of a parking meter. Dr. Krogman is looking ahead to what man will be like five million years from now. This alone is enough to comfort me. Sometimes I wonder if anyone will be able to identify man after next Friday. Yet here is Dr. Krogman looking ahead five million years and seeing us still running around, on flat feet, he says, and living for an average of 140 years. Now that's what I call comforting.</p>
