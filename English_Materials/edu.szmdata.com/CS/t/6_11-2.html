	<p>At Key West, a few days before Christmas, I visited the turtle slaughter house. It is one of the few tourist attractions on this island. Visitors take their kiddies by the hand and lead them to see the nice turtles.</p>
	<p>Before being killed and canned, the turtles lie unblinking in the sun, their flippers pierced and tied. Their leathery skin does not hide their helplessness and pain. They wear thick, hardened blood at their wounds. Crucified like thieves, they breathe in little sighs, they gulp, they wait.</p>
	<p>Later, in the room where the actual killing occurs, the butchers stride through blood and gore in boots. Because it was near Christmas, the owners of the plant had installed a speaker system for the workers and visitors. So while the turtles dried in the sun or lay exposed to the butchers' knives, Christmas bells rang out, <i>God Rest Ye Merry, Gentlemen.</i></p>
