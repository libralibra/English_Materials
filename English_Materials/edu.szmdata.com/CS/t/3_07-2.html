	<p>"What's your name?"</p>
	<p>"Ralph."</p>
	<p>The fat boy waited to be asked his name in turn but this proffer of acquaintance was not made; the fair boy called Ralph smiled vaguely, stood up, and began to make his way once more toward the lagoon. The fat boy hung steadily at his shoulder.</p>
	<p>"I expect there's a lot more of us scattered about. You haven't seen any others, have you?"</p>
	<p>Ralph shook his head and increased his speed. Then he tripped over a branch and came down with a crash.</p>
	<p>The fat boy stood by him, breathing hard.</p>
	<p>"My auntie told me not to run," he explained, "on account of my asthma."</p>
	<p>"Ass-mar?"</p>
	<p>"That's right. Can't catch me breath. I was the only boy in our school what had asthma," said the fat boy with a touch of pride. "And I've been wearing specs since I was three."</p>
	<p class="stems">Q. Ralph is portrayed as a cool and somewhat aloof character. Underline the brief phrase in the paragraph which illustrates this characteristic.</p>
