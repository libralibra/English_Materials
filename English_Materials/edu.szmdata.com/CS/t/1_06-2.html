	<p>Few can deny the strange coincidences in the deaths of John F. Kennedy and Abraham Lincoln. For example, Kennedy was elected in 1960 while Lincoln assumed the Presidency in 1860. Both men were assassinated from behind, on a Friday, and in the presence of their wives. The two men were born exactly one hundred years apart, as were their assassins, Lee Harvey Oswald and John Wilkes Booth. Perhaps the strangest coincidence is that Kennedy's secretary, whose name was Lincoln, advised him not to go to Dallas where he was shot. Lincoln's secretary, whose name was Kennedy, advised him not to go to the Ford Theater where he met his death.</p>
