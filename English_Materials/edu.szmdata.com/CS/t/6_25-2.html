	<p>In a small town in lower Burma, I was hated by large numbers of people. It was the only time in my life that I have been important enough for this to happen to me. I was a deputy police officer of the town. In an aimless, petty kind of way, anti-European feeling was very bitter. As an English police officer I was an obvious target and was baited whenever it seemed safe to do so. When a nimble Burman tripped me up on the football field and the referee (another Burman) looked the other way, the crowd yelled with hideous laughter. This happened more than once. In the end sneering faces of young men that met me everywhere and the insults hooted after me when I was at a safe distance, got badly on my nerves.</p>
