	<p>Sometime in the year 1869, a young Amherst College student spent twenty-five cents for admission to a poorly-attended lecture by Ralph Waldo Emerson. The great philosopher and poet, sixty-six years old and somewhat feeble, had to be assisted by his daughter to the platform. His eloquence and his genuine scholar's love for poetry made a permanent impression on at least one person in the audience. Young Henry Clay Folger was especially impressed with Emerson's lecture on Shakespeare. Sixty-three years later, this same lecture was read at the dedication of the greatest and most complete Shakespearian collection in the world: The Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington, D.C.</p>
	<p class="stems">Q. Underline the sentence which infers that Emerson's lecture was worth hearing.</p>
