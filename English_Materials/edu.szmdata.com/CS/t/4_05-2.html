	<p>Long before explorers and colonists landed on our shores, tribes of Indians named areas of land for the people who lived there. They also named the mountains, rivers or natural landmarks. Indians are known for their love of nature and the poetic way they described it. Today over half of our states carry names with Indian meanings. Many names were first given to rivers, then later used to name the state.</p>
	<p>Explorers, colonists, pioneers and settlers named some states in honor of kings, queens, and places in the Old World. Some names are so ancient, history cannot tell us when and how they originated.</p>
