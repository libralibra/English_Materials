	<p>I am a science fan. My education is scientific. I have even written a short article for a scientific magazine. Science, to my mind, is the one reliable means we have to discover the truth. This is why, when an error is made in the name of Science, I feel the way a man would if his favorite uncle had taken to drink. Over the years, I have come to feel that way about what science has done to food. I agree that Americans set as good a table as any other people in the world. I agree that our food is nutritious. The only trouble with it is this: year by year it becomes less good to eat. It appeals more and more to the eye. But who eats with his eyes? Almost everything used to taste better when I was a kid. Now everything looks great but tastes like cardboard.</p>
