	<p>Coleridge's <i>Ancient Mariner</i>, becalmed upon a glassy ocean and dying of thirst, was not the only one to be surrounded by water he dare not drink. Modern man is almost as badly off. Our rivers and lakes and now even the oceans are in serious trouble as they continue to bear never-intended burdens of pollution and industrial expansion. Without treatment, our waters are not fit to drink, nor are they even usable raw for many of our industrial processes. But, unlike the salty Mariner, we are finding a way out of the problem. The very technology that helped get us into our difficulty is beginning to get us out. We are turning to water treatment specialists, chemists, engineers, and equipment builders, whose job it is to make our drinking water safe and to process waste water so that it will not be a source of pollution.</p>
	<p class="stems">Q. Underline the sentence which supports the conclusion that America should have limited her expansion or at least controlled her pollution long ago.</p>
