	<p>In the minds of many Americans, Boston is a kind of historic blur, a vast urban museum of old monuments, baked bean factories and people named Lowell and Cabot who talk only to each other and to God. The musty aura of Boston's image may linger in part because the city itself doesn't boast of being the biggest or boomingest of places, nor does it aspire to such goals. In its own low key self-promotion, Boston neither brags of its past nor projects some galactic future. Boston prides itself on the effort to be <i>livable</i>. It is not the old monuments but a growing variety of contemporary attractions that have made modern Boston seem so livable that a few years ago, in a survey of Ivy League graduates, it replaced New York as the city most favored as a place to live and work after college.</p>
