	<p>My first encounter with rattlesnakes was a fortunate experience. The big rattler was old, and had led too easy a life. There was not much fight left in him. He had probably lived there for years, with a fat prairie dog for breakfast whenever he felt like it. He had a sheltered home, even an owl-feather bed, perhaps, and he had forgotten that the world doesn't owe rattlers a living. So in reality, it was a mock adventure. The game was fixed for me by chance, as it probably was for many a dragon-slayer. I had been adequately armed. The snake was too content to move very fast, and I had Antonia beside me, to appreciate and admire me.</p>
	<p>That snake hung on our corral fence for several days. Some of the neighbors came to see it and agreed that it was the biggest rattler ever killed in those parts. This was enough for Antonia. She liked me better from that time on, and she never took a superior tone with me again. I had killed a big snake&#151;I was now a big fellow.</p>
