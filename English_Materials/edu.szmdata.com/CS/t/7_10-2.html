	<p class="danglingIndent">To think to know the country and not know </p>
	<p class="danglingIndent">The hillside on the day the sun lets go </p>
	<p class="danglingIndent">Ten million silver lizards out of snow!</p>
	<p class="danglingIndent">As often as I've seen it done before </p>
	<p class="danglingIndent">I can't pretend to tell the way it's done.</p>
	<p class="danglingIndent">It looks as if some magic of the sun </p>
	<p class="danglingIndent">Lifted the rug that bred them on the floor </p>
	<p class="danglingIndent">And the light breaking on them made them run.</p>
	<p class="danglingIndent">But if l thought to stop the wet stampede,</p>
	<p class="danglingIndent">And caught one silver lizard by the tail,</p>
	<p class="danglingIndent">And put my foot on one without avail,</p>
	<p class="danglingIndent">And threw myself wet-elbowed and wet-kneed </p>
	<p class="danglingIndent">In front of twenty others' wriggling speed,&#151;</p>
	<p class="danglingIndent">In the confusion of them all aglitter,</p>
	<p class="danglingIndent">And birds that joined in the excited fun </p>
	<p class="danglingIndent">By doubling and redoubling song and twitter,</p>
	<p class="danglingIndent">I have no doubt I'd end by holding none.</p>
	<p class="stems">Q. Underline two lines which appeal to the sense of touch.</p>
