	<p>A micro-wilderness comes alive to its "viewers" along a unique trail in Colorado's White River National Forest, through the senses of smell, touch, hearing, even taste&#151;all the senses except sight. The Roaring Fork Braille Trail is a sell-guiding nature course which winds for a quarter of a mile through dense spruce and fir forests. It allows the blind to learn about a part of the natural world often denied to them. By following a nylon cord to the 23 stations printed in braille along the trail, the blind person learns about plant, animal and rock forms in the area.</p>
	<p>The "viewer" will hear the sounds of a tumbling mountain stream, listen to the wind and birds in the trees and bushes; feel annual rings in a stump, the shape of a flower, lichens on a rock, pine needles or sphagnum bog underfoot; smell the balsam and the fir; bite a twig or a leaf.</p>
	<p class="stems">Q. Underline the sentence which describes how visitors find their way along the trail.</p>
