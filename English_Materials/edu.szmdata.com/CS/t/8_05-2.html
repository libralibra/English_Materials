	<p>All warm-blooded animals are very helpless at first. Young birds and young bats must be taught to fly. Thousands of young seals drown every year. They never learn to swim "naturally." The mother has to take them out under her flipper and show them how: Birds sing without instruction; however, they do not sing well unless they are able to hear older members of their species.

Insects, seem to start life equipped with all necessary reflexes, but they seem to improve their talents with practice. Young spiders, for example, begin by making quite primitive little webs.
