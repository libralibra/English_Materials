	<p>Insects have spread to every possible place on the face of the globe. Everywhere man has gone, he has found insects there before him. Seven hundred miles north of the Arctic Circle, survivors from the ill-fated <i>Jeannette</i> were amazed to see a butterfly. Thirty-five thousand feet above sea level, a balloonist noticed a honeybee flying around the basket of his craft. Hundreds of miles from the nearest coast, mariners have seen water bugs skating over the surface of the swells.</p>
	<p>High in the Himalayas, mountain climbers have found insects. A praying mantis was discovered 16,000 feet above sea level. In Ecuador, butterflies were sighted among the crags of the Andes at 18,500 feet. A moth in South America is encountered all the way from lowland swamps up to 10,000 feet on mountainsides. At a height of 200 feet, scientists have figured, there is an insect for every 6,748 cubic feet of air. One mile above the earth the ratio is one insect for each 117,546 cubic feet.</p>
	<p class="stems">Q. Underline the sentence which suggests that insects may be found at the South Pole.</p>
