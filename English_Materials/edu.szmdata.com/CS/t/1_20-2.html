	<p>Captain Cook, the noted world explorer, encountered an unusual animal during his first visit to Australia. He pointed to it grazing in the distance and asked his native guide to identify it. The guide appeared confused and finally said, "Kang-a-roo" which Cook carefully noted in his word book. The missionaries who later came to Australia were anxious to see a kang-a-roo but their inquiries were met with puzzled looks.
