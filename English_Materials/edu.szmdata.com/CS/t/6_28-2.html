	<p>When the Peace Corps first was proposed, it was ridiculed in such terms as "Kennedy's Kiddie Korps" and the "Second Children's Crusade". At the same time historian Arnold Toynbee predicted, "I believe that in the Peace Corps ... mankind is going to see Western Man at his best." Time has proven Toynbee correct. In its first five years the Peace Corps had made an impact beyond the hopes of many early supporters. In numbers alone its record was impressive. Nearly 12,000 Volunteers were at work in forty-six nations in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. Another 1,500 Volunteers are training for service overseas. By 1970, nearly 50,000 Americans had served in and returned from Peace Corps assignments.</p>
