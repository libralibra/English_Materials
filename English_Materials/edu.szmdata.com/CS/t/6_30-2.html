	<p>To the visitor from the hinterland who lands in mid-town Manhattan, the impression is one of confusion, noise, dirt, and monumental indifference. "Is this," he asks, "the celebrated Mecca that annually draws businessmen, students, job-seekers, and tourists from every corner of the globe?" If he swiftly decides that "It's a nice place to visit, but ...," he has failed to find New York's open sesame. The jade expert can find an emperor's collection of carvings in the Jade Room of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. The artist can leisurely study a rare volume of William Blake's etchings in one of the specialized rooms of the Main Library, or walk for years through the endless public and private galleries. The chess-player finds his friends at the Marshall Chess Club; the tired businessman, his excitement at the Copa; the historian, his archives at the Butler Library; the Orientalist, his conferees at Asia House. But New York's magic door will open only if the visitor arrives with a key.</p>
	<p class="stems">Q. Underline three tonal words which summarize New York's atmosphere to the tourist.</p></body>
