	<p>On April 15, 1912, the <i>Titanic</i>, the largest ship in the world, struck an iceberg off Newfoundland and sank in the early morning darkness, taking over 1500 lives.</p>
	<p>The luxury liner was making her first Atlantic voyage from England to New York when the tragedy occurred. Of the 2,223 aboard, only about 700 people were saved. Millions of dollars in jewelry and furs went down with the ship. The <i>Titanic</i> was thought to be unsinkable.</p>
	<p>Earlier in the night the captain of the ship had been warned that there were icebergs in the area. The warning was apparently ignored as the big liner sped on through the darkness, heading swiftly toward its destiny.</p>
	<p>At 11:40 P.M. the <i>Titanic</i>, a man-made giant, rammed the white, silent giant of nature and sank in two and one-half hours. Never will the world, forget that tragic event.</p>
	<p class="stems">Q. Underline an expression which shows that the ship carried mostly wealthy people.</p>
