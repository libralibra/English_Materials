	<p>There are several things that every defensive driver should learn. To begin with, the defensive driver should learn to drive courteously. That is, he should always let the other person have the right-of-way if there is any doubt. Also, the defensive driver should learn to anticipate, or guess, what the other driver is going to do next. This gives him time to get his car into a safer position, if necessary. Furthermore, every defensive driver should learn to give the proper signal before changing directions, allowing enough time for other drivers to react to it. Lastly, every defensive driver should learn to keep a safe distance between his car and the car ahead.</p>
	<p class="stems">Q. Underline the sentence which states the importance of knowing what the other driver is up to.</p>
