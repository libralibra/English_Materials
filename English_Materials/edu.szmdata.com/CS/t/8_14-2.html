	<p>The search for ways of preserving foods is not new. Primitive man learned that he could make foods last by drying them. The Indians, for example, hung buffalo and deer meat in the sun. The greatest single advance began in 1800 when a Frenchman, Nicolas Appert, discovered that he could preserve certain foods by sealing them in jars and keeping the air from them. The process was the start of the vast canning industry which brings us many foods in all seasons. Pasteurizing is another process which delays spoilage. It is of great importance to the dairy industry. Foods like apricots, prunes, peaches, and apples are often preserved by drying. The use of chemicals is another method, and some foods are cooked with sugar. But recently the use of frozen foods has grown quickly. Thus, today, more foods than ever before are being processed by freezing.</p>
