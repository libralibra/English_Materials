	<p>To discover whether bees can see colors, the following experiment is set up. A table is put in a garden, and on the table is a piece of blue cardboard with a drop of syrup on it. After a short time, bees come to the syrup. The bees then fly to their hive and give the syrup to other bees in the hive. Then they return to the feeding-place which they have discovered. After a while, we take away the blue cardboard with the syrup on it. Instead of this card, we now put a blue card on the left side of the first feeding-place and a red card to the right of the first feeding-place. These new cards have no syrup on them. Thus, the blue card is on the left, the red card on the right, and there is nothing where the first blue feeding-card used to be. Very soon bees arrive again, and fly straight to the blue card. None go to the red card.</p>
