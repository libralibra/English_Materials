	<p>Corgis are funny-looking dogs. There is no getting around it. They look their best in a seated position, showing to best advantage the shapely head and broad chest and concealing the too-heavy body and too-short legs. They also look great running, and running is what Corgis do best, in spite of their shape.</p>
	<p>Cardigan Corgis were used for driving cattle when they came to Cardiganshire with the Celts about 1200 <span class="smallCaps">b.c.</span> Centuries of breeding developed their amazing speed and ability to flatten themselves to the ground to avoid hoof-kicks. Pembroke Corgis are somewhat smaller, and look a little less as if they had been put together from several unmatched pieces. They lack the handsome fox-like tail of the Cardigan.</p>
