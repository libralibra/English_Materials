	<p>Though the pain from a scorpion's sting is sharp and may last a few days, there is little danger of serious or lasting damage. The scorpion is a fierce-looking creature with an armored, jointed body supported by eight legs. It has many eyes, yet for all practical purposes, it is almost blind. It feels its way around with large, finger-like pincers. These pincers are powerful weapons with which the scorpion seizes and crushes its prey. The jointed tail, with its poisonous needle point, can be used with deadly accuracy in case the pincers are not effective. Sinister as the scorpion may be in the insect world, it performs an important service for man. Scorpions devour many varieties of insects which destroy grain fields. In one day, for example, an adult scorpion dines on nearly a hundred of these destructive insects.</p>
