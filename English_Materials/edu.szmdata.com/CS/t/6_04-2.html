	<p>I am a person who bears grudges and I have a lot against three of my children, Manuel, Roberto, and Consuelo. My body is becoming half-paralyzed from being so angry with these children of mine. I am ashamed to talk about it. It is hard for a father to have such sons. They turned out bad because of bad surroundings and bad companions. Their friends are doing these boys no good. It is a shame that I cannot do anything about it. In spite of my advice, they go the other way instead of taking the straight path.</p>
	<p>There is nothing better in this world than upright work. I am a poor and humble person, but I try to do things the best way I can. They can't say their father came home drunk or abandoned them. An uncle of theirs just died of drink. It seems they take after their uncle more than they do me. I don't understand it.</p>
