	<p>O. Henry's last words, spoken with a smile, were, "I don't want to go home in the dark." Could he return to us he would find that he did not go home in the dark, but that an increasing radiance shines about his name and fame. He is read today not only in English but also in French, Spanish, German, Swedish, and Japanese.</p>
	<p>In boyhood days it was not writing that interested O. Henry. It was the cartoonist's art. To our way of thinking, no such youthful genius in pen or pencil sketch had yet appeared. Later on he tried his hand as editor of <i>The Rolling Stone</i> in Austin, Texas, and as reporter on the Houston <i>Post</i>. After his move to New York, he felt the lure of drama, poetry, the musical comedy, and the personal novel.</p>
	<p class="stems">Q. Write an expression which shows the writer's recognition of O. Henry's success.</p>
