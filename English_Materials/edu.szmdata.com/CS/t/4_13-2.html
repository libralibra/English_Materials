	<p>The real problem with pollution is people&#151;the way people think about their environment. We're all reluctant to accept the fact that our natural resources are fixed&#151;fixed, in fact, since the earth was created. We want to go on using virgin materials. We aren't educated to reusing resources, or even placing a value on "waste" products. We're a crisis society. Currently, we are fearful of losing the use of our water and air to pollution. In one context, it's probably a good thing that we are so concerned because now we'll begin to adjust our thinking on the values of natural resources and reuse. We once thought of water and air as free. They're not, not any more than the land is free. People haven't wanted to be educated on the part they must play in solving our environmental problems.</p>
	<p class="stems">Q. Underline the sentence which summarizes the conclusion concerning the solution to our environmental problems.</p>
