	<p>Names of dogs end up in 176th place in the list of things that amaze and fascinate me. They run from such plain and simple names as Spot, Sport, Rex, Brownie, and Rover all the way to such fancy names as Prince Rudolph Hertenberg Gratzheim of Daradorf. Others include Darling Mist o'Love II of Heather-Light-Hollywood. All these names and others like them were thought up by adults, all of whom in every other way, I am told, have made a normal adjustment to life. In addition to the plain and fancy names, there are the sarcastic and the cute. Sarcastic names are given by people who do not like dogs very much. The most popular ones during the war were Mussolini, Tojo, and Adolf. The cute people call their dogs Bubbles, Sparkles, Twinkles, Lovums, and Sweetums.</p>
