	<p>What are some of the steps a person can take to prevent his house from being burglarized while he is away? One step is to make sure that the house has a lived-in look. Living room shades should be pulled down only half-way. Bedrooms that usually have the shades pulled down at night should be left down. Another is to make sure that all outside locks are the dead-bolt type. Still another is to leave several 100 watt lights burning and make sure that one is in the kitchen. Lights that turn on and off automatically are the best. Then too, it is a good idea to leave the radio tuned in to a talking station. Any type of conversation makes a burglar think twice before trying to enter. Finally, while away on vacation, make sure that nothing collects in the front or in back of the house. Specifically, make certain that the newspaper is stopped and that a trusted neighbor has been asked to pick up the mail. Burglars are especially alert to piled-up newspapers and over-stuffed mail boxes.</p>
