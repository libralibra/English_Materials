	<p>For most people, public TV used to be that station they hit while switching from <i>Lucy</i> to the ball game, the station of earnest dissertations on the birds and the planets, economics and science. To many viewers it seemed dull. Recently, however, the image of public TV has been changing radically. True, the essential academic diet is still there by day, nourishing the nation's students and school children. But by night public TV becomes a network where not only is the mind stimulated but the senses stirred. It was public TV that brought <i>The Forsyte Saga</i>, John Galsworthy's glimpse of life and love in upper-middle class Victorian England, to the American screen; the honor-laden series <i>Civilisation</i>, narrated by the British art historian Lord Clark; and the <i>Great American Dream Machine</i>, a weekly program that calls attention to the madness of our time. Public TV made <i>The French Chef</i>, Julia Child and Big Bird of <i>Sesame Street</i> household names.</p>
