	<p>The driver looked quickly back at the restaurant for a second. "Didn't you see the <i>No Riders</i> sticker on the win'shield?"</p>

If he refused now, not only was he not a good guy, but he was forced to carry a sticker, was not allowed to have company, if he took in the hitch-hiker he was automatically a good guy and also he was not one whom any rich bastard could kick around. He knew he was being trapped, but he couldn't see a way out. And he wanted to be a good guy. He glanced again at the restaurant. "Scrunch down on the running board till we get around the bend," he said.</p>
