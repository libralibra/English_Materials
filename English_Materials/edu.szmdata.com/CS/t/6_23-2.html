	<p>We Americans are wasteful people, not used to saving. The frontiersmen began this pattern, for nature's resources were so plentiful that no one ever imagined a shortage. Within a few years of the first Virginia settlement, for example, pioneers burned down their houses when they were ready to move west. They wanted to have the nails for future use. No one ever gave a thought to the priceless hardwoods that went up in smoke. As a people we destroy many things that other people save. I noticed this when I was living in England. I received a letter from one of England's largest banks. It was enclosed in a used envelope that had been readdressed to me. Such a practice would be unthinkable in the United States. American banks, even the smallest, always use expensive stationery with the names of all twenty-eight vice-presidents listed on one side of the page.</p>
