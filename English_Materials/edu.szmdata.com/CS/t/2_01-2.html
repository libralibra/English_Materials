	<p>Choosing a dog is an important decision. All puppies are lovable, but the full-grown pet must be visualized. Adult height, length, weight, appetite, and nature must be considered before bringing home a cuddly ball of fur. Consider, too, the limitations of your home or apartment; if you live in the country, your problems may be few, but if you live in the city, exercise of the animal may become a problem.</p>
