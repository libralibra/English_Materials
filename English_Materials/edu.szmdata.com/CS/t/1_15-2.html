	<p>Here can be seen some of the most fascinating exhibits anywhere in the world. The Wright Brothers' plane, for example, occupies one small corner of the mammoth museum, and nearby is astronaut John Glenn's <i>Friendship 7</i>. The world's largest elephant stands in lifelike splendor for all to view. A visitor may ponder and wonder over dinosaur bones, Lincoln's hat, and ship models where even the thickness of the paint is to scale. Wax Indians are so realistic that one woman wrote to the President demanding that he forbid the "shooting and stuffing of them". A fascinating blend of the realistic and the unusual, the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C., appeals to everyone.</p>
