	<p>During the first week of September, 1900, everybody went swimming on Galveston Beach, Texas. There'd never been such a fine surf&#151;great rolling combers that swept in from the Gulf. Yet there was hardly a breath of wind.</p>
	<p>A blanket of humid heat lay over the city. Storm warnings had gone out to the Gulf shipping companies. The barometer was falling. Those signs should have been of concern to the people of a town built on a sand bar only nine feet above the sea at its highest point. But nobody seemed to be worried. Scientists had said that the city was safe from storm and flood because the long, gentle slope of the sea bottom would protect it.</p>
	<p>On Friday afternoon of that week the sea-bathing had to be stopped. The surf was becoming too dangerous. Still there was no wind. The surface of the Gulf water was smooth, gray satin lined with streaks of foam. Older citizens began to study the sky toward the southeast, toward the Caribbean where hurricanes are born.</p>
