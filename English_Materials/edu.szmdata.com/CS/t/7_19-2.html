	<p>The father of Michelangelo worried about his son in Rome. In his letters he urged Michelangelo to take care of himself. He must keep his head moderately warm, he wrote, have himself rubbed down, but never wash. He recommended for headaches a dish made of herbs and split peas.</p>
	<p>Michelangelo paid little attention to his father's advice. Instead he worked for a whole year without stopping. Then one day the Pieta was placed in Saint Peter's Church for everyone to see. People were overwhelmed by its beauty. Tenderly the Virgin holds her dead son in her lap, and on her face is an expression of deep sorrow. Some people were surprised that the Mother of Christ had the face of a young girl, but Michelangelo explained that Christ's Mother was eternally young.</p>
