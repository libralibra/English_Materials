	<p>In America, the first aim of education was to prepare children to read the Scripture and its intent was religious. Later on the purpose was to enable people to read and write, and take part in the democratic process. Still later, the purpose became to prepare young people for jobs in a modern society. At no rime was the aim of education to prepare students to become individuals or complete human beings. This aspect of education was left to the home, church, mass media, and the city streets. To a certain large extent, it still remains there. Yet in a society that can easily be foreseen, one in which mechanization will reduce the human factors in industrial production, the purpose of education must once again change. It must begin to educate people to live full and meaningful lives in which "jobs" are at best only incidental, or at least for jobs that are oriented toward human service rather than physical productivity.</p>
