	<p>On Easter Sunday, 1722, a Dutch explorer, Jacob Roggeveen, landed on a remote volcanic island some 2200 miles west of the South American coast. There, on the easternmost island, which he named Easter Island, the Dutchman found an advanced society suffering from violent internal conflict. Its people were living among the ruins of their former great achievements. Great stone statues had been pushed from their bases and lay broken, while the island people hid from one another in caves. Roggeveen was no doubt impressed by the huge sculptures and the other signs of an advanced civilization. However, like other European explorers who later visited Easter Island, he did not feel that the place had much economic potential. Thus, he wrote about it as a place of no importance to the world.</p>
	<p class="stems">Q. Underline a sentence which proves that the society on Easter Island had declined over the years.</p>
