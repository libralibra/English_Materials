	<p>The Telephone Crisis Intervention Service, better known as Hotlines, provides counseling to anyone in need. Found in many cities across the country, the T.C.I.S. lends a kind ear to people who need help. Young people favor the Hotline service because they sense a real concern in the listener. They also like the lack of red tape&#151;there are no forms, no receptionists, and no waiting rooms. A simple phone call places the caller in contact with someone who wants to help.</p>
