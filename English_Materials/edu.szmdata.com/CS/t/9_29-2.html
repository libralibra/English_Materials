	<p>Smoking marijuana has some advantages over drinking alcohol. Marijuana is not physically habit forming as alcohol often is. The user usually suffers no hangover. It is not necessary to use larger and larger amounts of it to get the same effect.</p>
	<p>However, smoking marijuana also has very serious disadvantages. A user is considered a felon if he is caught. As a result, many jobs which require clearance may be closed to him, such as teaching or working in a government position. A marijuana user who is "high", loses some of his judgment of depth and time. And finally, since marijuana provides a means of escape, young users often suffer serious personality changes, and as a result, may fail to develop to their full potential.</p>
