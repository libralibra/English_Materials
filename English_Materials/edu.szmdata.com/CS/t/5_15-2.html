	<p>Natasha loved the journey itself: the wind in her face, the sense of careless freedom, the sight of red and yellow leaves swirling in the sunlight. She loved the knowledge that someone not herself would cook their meal and wash the dinner dishes. She could hardly bear the certainty that, they would stay for a night in a room with two beds instead of one. The thoughts of a bell to call a waiter who would bring them a bedtime cup of tea was delightful. Perhaps they could order a bit of vodka in an ice-filled tumbler and drink it slowly with grunts of complete pleasure. Even the cost&#151;three rubles for the night&#151;did not bother her, so long as they had a few kopecks left for food.</p>
