	<p>An interesting incident led pioneer banker James Sloan Hutchinson to organize the San Francisco Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. One day Mr. Hutchinson was walking on Sansome Street in downtown San Francisco. He saw a boar break away from a drove of hogs on its way to market. The boar ran up Washington Street, chased by two mounted drovers with lassos. The men lassoed the runaway boar. One lasso caught its front legs and the other, its hind legs. The men dragged the squealing pig across the rough cobblestones of Washington Street. Mr. Hutchinson was so angered by the cruel treatment of the pig that he stepped into the street and stopped the drovers. Supported by other angry witnesses, he urged the men to put the boar into a cart and bring it back humanely.</p>
