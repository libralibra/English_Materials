	<p>It was dark in the little California town when the two men stepped from the lunch car and strode through the back streets. The air was full of the sweet smell of fruit from the packing plants. High over the corners, blue arc lights swung in the wind and put moving shadows of telephone wires on the ground. The dirty windows dismally reflected the street lights. The old wooden buildings were silent and resting.</p>
	<p>The two men were about the same size, but one was much older than the other. Their hair was cropped; they wore blue jeans. As they swung down the dark street, footsteps echoed back loudly from the wooden buildings. The younger man began to whistle <i>Come to Me My Melancholy Baby</i>. He stopped abruptly. "I wish that damn tune would get out of my head. It's been going all day. It's an old tune, too."</p>
	<p>His companion turned toward him. "You're scared, Root. Tell the truth. You're scared as hell."</p>
	<p class="stems">Q. Underline a sentence which clearly establishes that the action occurs at night.</p>
