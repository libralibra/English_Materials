	<p>One thing strikes a visitor at Walnut Hills Community Elementary School near Denver. The rooms are gigantic and <i>there aren't any desks</i>. But watch your step! Children are lying all over the floor, some reading by themselves, some doing worksheets in groups of twos and threes; others sit in small groups asking questions of an adult. It looks as if the children have rebelled, occupied the superintendent's office, and are running the school the way they would like. All play and "no more teacher's dirty looks".</p>
	<p>But nobody has routed Edward C. Pino from his office. The superintendent of the Cherry Creek school district knows the school is running just the way he likes it. The children enjoy school&#151;many come early and leave late. Absences have been halved. What's more, the children are learning academic subjects far better than average. And they understand a lot more about themselves and others than most children do.</p>
	<p class="stems">Q. Underline the sentence which supports the conclusion that most people expect schools to be traditional.</p>
