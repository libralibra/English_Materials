	<p>Stormy's gone, of course. He died before the last Yankee clipper furled her silver sails. But stories about "that good old man" are told still wherever old sailors gather. Just where Old Stormalong was born isn't important. He first appeared on a wharf in Boston Harbor. The captain of the <i>Lady of the Sea</i>, the largest clipper ship in the China trade, was signing on men. Stormy gave his full name, Alfred Bullrod Stormalong. Without looking up from his ledger, the captain wrote down the initials, "A.B."</p>
	<p>A.B. Stormalong stood five fathoms tall, which is the same as thirty feet. The captain glanced up at his new man. He whistled with surprise. "Phew!" he said. "There's an able-bodied seaman for you, boys."</p>
	<p>Someone noticed that the giant's initials stood for just that. From that day to this sailors have tacked A.B. after their names. This shows that they are able-bodied seamen like Stormy.</p>
	<p class="stems">Q. Underline the sentence in the second paragraph which supports the answer to question No. 1.</p>
