	<p>The Museum of Modern Art in New York City is known throughout the world. It has a collection of contemporary masterpieces in painting and sculpture. Few people are aware that, in the summer months, the Museum presents Summer-garden, a fine program designed to give tired New Yorkers and out-of-town visitors an opportunity to enjoy special presentations. These include films, dramatic events, poetry readings, dance programs, and lectures in a surrounding of modern sculpture and landscaping.</p>
	<p>Summergarden takes place in the Museum's sculpture garden from June through September on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday evenings from six until eleven o'clock. The garden is transformed into a free city park in the very heart of the largest city in the United States. The site is lighted so that visitors get dramatic views of twentieth century sculpture, as well as recent works. Fifty thousand visitors attended Summergarden in its first two seasons, and this year more people than ever have been drawn to it.</p>
