	<p>A purebred dog is a type of dog that is recognized by the American Kennel Club as a distinct breed. The greatest advantage in choosing a purebred puppy is that you know what the dog will be like in appearance, size and behavior when he grows up. The cute, cuddly, mixed breed puppy that you select at random may grow into a big, long-haired, pony-sized animal instead of the small pet you really wanted. The long-legged mixed breed puppy that you visualize as a large-sized companion for country walks may stop growing soon and turn out to be a small house-loving pet.</p>
	<p>When you buy a purebred puppy, you will be reasonably certain of having that kind of dog when the puppy has matured. Purebred dogs vary very little in size, weight and other physical traits. In addition, dogs of a particular breed usually have definite temperament and behavior characteristics.</p>
	<p class="stems">Q. Underline the sentence which supports the conclusion that purebred dogs enjoy a definite status.</p>
