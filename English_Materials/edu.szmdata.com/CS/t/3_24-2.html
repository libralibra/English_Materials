	<p>On this day, like all the others, Old Pedro stood beside Cordera holding the restraining rope loosely in his hand. Cordera remembered the place, its tender green grass and business-like strangers.</p>
	<p>A short, round-faced farmer paused before Cordera. He inspected her teeth, patted her side, and mentally figured her girth. Pedro said, "Four hundred pesos," and looked away before the man could see his face. "You can't be serious," the farmer laughed in disbelief, "four hundred pesos for this old cow?" Pedro remained motionless, staring into the hazy horizon.</p>
	<p>Later in the day, a well-dressed, prosperous-looking young man asked Pedro how much he wanted for the animal. "Five hundred pesos and not a centavo less." The price drove the man away like all the others, and Pedro made no attempt to disguise his satisfaction. He quieted his conscience with the thought that he had been willing to sell; the fault lay with the others who were not willing to meet his price. He turned homeward, stroking the brown nose of Cordera, assuring her that she need never worry about seeing the inside of a slaughterhouse while he was alive.</p>
	<p class="stems">Q. Underline the sentence in the passage which reveals the reason for Pedro's odd sales approach.</p>
