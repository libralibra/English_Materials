	<p>From childhood, my sister and I have had a well-grounded dislike for our friends the birds. We came to hate them when she was ten and I was eleven. We had been sent to one of those horrible girls' camps where Indian lore is everything and the owners put up little signs telling everyone to be Good Sports. From the moment Eileen and I arrived at dismal old Camp Hi-Wah, we were Bad Sports, and we liked it.</p>
	<p>We refused to get out of bed when the bugle blew. We fought against scrubbing our teeth in public. We sneered when the flag was lowered at sunset. We avoided doing a good deed a day. It made a wonderful scandal. All the other campers loved dear old Camp Hi-Wah, which shows you what kind of people they were.</p>
	<p class="stems">Q. Underline a sentence which suggests an attitude of enjoyment in rejecting camp life.</p>
