	<p>Japan's capital city has been Tokyo, meaning Eastern Capital, for the past hundred years. Before that it was Kyoto, meaning <i>The</i> Capital. Kyoto was the great capital for well over 1000 years. Today's noisy Tokyo was completely rebuilt after its ruin in World War II. In areal sense it is not even twenty-five years old. Kyoto was also scheduled to be bombed but, as one American argued at the time, "It would be like destroying Rome or Jerusalem. It's not just a Japanese treasure, but a world treasure!" Kyoto was spared. And today, mellowed by twelve centuries, it has the grace of old silver. Tokyo is Japan's dynamic today, Kyoto, her perfumed yesterday. Tokyo is her brain, Kyoto, her soul.</p>
	<p class="stems">Q. Underline the sentence, which proves that Kyoto holds significance for many countries of the world.</p>
