	<p>The fishermen tested the lashings on their double-pronged fish spears, and Sarkak, taking one of these, walked carefully out into the water, for the rocks beneath his feet were smooth and slippery. When the water reached the top of his sealskin boots, he stopped and stood quietly, his eyes adjusting to the strong sunlight that flashed across the water. He held the spear lightly poised in his right hand and waited, motionless. Then he struck downward with a thrust so swift that I could not see it, and when he raised the spear again, it held a huge thrashing sea trout, pierced through the back and firmly; held between the two springing jaws of bone. Blood ran down the silver sides of the fish, and Sarkak laughed with joy, for this was what every man lived for. Here he was with a whole camp of men, women, children and dogs to feed, and because we lived like true people, offending neither men nor spirits, the fish had come once more to give themselves to us.</p>
