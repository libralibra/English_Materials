	<p>One day I found myself at the swamp just staring at the water. It was clear and clean, but when you scooped up a handful it tasted a little like leaves smelled if you crumpled them in your hands. It was full of all sorts of little things, like bugs that hopped and popped, and little crawlers that left a tiny wake behind them. Fish swirled and rose to snap at the first of the fly hatch. A big bullfrog gave a loud, croaking noise and leaped into the water with a splash. The noises made it so lonely in that swamp you just wanted to cry. A bittern roared. A heron squawked. A kingfisher rattled. A deer snorted and barked. A bird screeched. A crow cawed. Somewhere deep in the swamp there was a growl and a scream as a wildcat killed a rabbit. Leaves rustled. Things fell off trees. I felt the dark creeping in on me.</p>
