	<p>"I believe we should get the war over," I said. "It would not finish it if one side stopped fighting. It would only be worse if we stopped fighting."</p>
	<p>"It could not be worse," Passini said respectfully. "There is nothing worse than war."</p>
	<p>"Defeat is worse," I replied.</p>
	<p>"I do not believe it," Passini said still respectfully. "What is defeat? You go home."</p>
	<p>"They come after you. They take your home. They take your sisters."</p>
	<p>"I don't believe it," Passini said. "They can't do that to everybody. Let everybody defend his home. Let them keep their sisters in the house."</p>
	<p>"They hang you. They come and make you be a soldier again. Not in the auto-ambulance, in the infantry," I insisted. "They can't hang every one," Passini answered.</p>
	<p>"An outside nation can't make you be a soldier," Manera said. "At the first battle you all run."</p>
	<p>"I think you do not know anything about being conquered and so you think it is not bad."</p>
