	<p>In a very real sense, people who have read good literature have lived more than people who cannot or will not read. To have read <i>Gulliver's Travels</i> is to have had the experience, with <i>Jonathan Swift</i>, of learning about man's inhumanity to man. To read <i>Huckleberry Finn</i> is to feel what it is like to drift down the Mississippi River on a raft. To have read Byron is to have suffered his rebellions with him and to have enjoyed his nose-thumbing at society. To have read <i>Native Son</i> is to know how it feels to be frustrated in the particular way in which Blacks in Chicago are frustrated. This is effective communication. It enables us to feel how others felt about life, even if they lived thousands of miles away and centuries ago. It is not true that "we have only one life to live." If we read, we can live as many more lives and as many kinds of lives as we wish.</p>
	<p class="stems">Q. Underline the sentence which suggests that the range of literature is endless.</p>
