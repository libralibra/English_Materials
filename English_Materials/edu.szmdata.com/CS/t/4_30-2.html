	<p>The nation's 27,000 active veterinarians, including almost 800 women, work in 30 fields of interest. The major areas are public health, research, and private practice. Most veterinarians are in private practice treating livestock and pets. Many work for federal, state, and local governments, inspecting food, enforcing health laws, and combating environmental problems. Some serve in the Armed Forces caring for sentry dogs, maintaining base sanitation, and carrying out other disease prevention activities. Some are teachers and researchers. And some work in industry helping to develop new drugs and foods.</p>
	<p>Once concerned solely with livestock in rural areas, veterinary medicine has evolved into a complex and varied profession. Today's veterinarians, mostly city-based, deal not only with a broad range of animal diseases but play a widening role in improving conditions for human health.</p>
