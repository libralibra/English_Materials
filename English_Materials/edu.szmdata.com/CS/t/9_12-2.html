	<p>Sandwich, Massachusetts, is an interesting place to visit. Every known type of glassware was made in Sandwich&#151;blown, blown molded, and pressed. The glass was famous in its day. Yet, despite the success of the plant, production ended in 1888 in a labor dispute in which the owners closed the plant rather than meet the worker's demands. In the 63 years that the factory was in operation, more than $30 million worth of glass was made there. Today Sandwich glass is highly prized by collectors, which makes the Museum and its famous collection popular with lovers of antiques. Reproductions of Sandwich glass are sold at many of the gift shops in and around the town, while antique dealers demand high prices for the original glass pieces.</p>
	<p>Another attraction in Sandwich is the Yesteryears Doll Museum. Yesteryears Doll Museum was founded by a retired Army Colonel, R. F. Thomas and his wife. Mrs. Thomas began collecting dolls in Europe and the Far East while her husband served tours of duty in those areas. Today, her collection of 3,000 dolls and doll houses is valued at more than a million dollars.</p>
	<p class="stems">Q. Underline a sentence which gives information on the collecting of dolls for the Yesteryears Museum.</p>
