	<p>A little more than two years ago, the central food market of Paris&#151;teeming, crowded Les Halles&#151;was moved to a new site five miles south of the city near Orly Airport. Frenchmen and foreigners alike mourned the end of an era. The feeling of loss was especially acute because Paris is not a city accustomed to sudden change, and Les Halles represented a tradition going back to medieval times.</p>
	<p>An open-air market was established at the site of Les Halles Centrales some 900 years ago. In the mid-nineteenth century, Napoleon III commissioned architect Victor Baltard to design buildings to enclose the sprawling market. Baltard's twelve enormous iron and glass pavilions were acclaimed as architectural masterworks, but most visitors have been far more intrigued by the rich carnival of life that swirled around them. During the last twenty years, however, it became apparent that Les Halles&#151;described by Emile Zola as "the belly of Paris"&#151;was not up to the task of feeding a growing city.</p>
