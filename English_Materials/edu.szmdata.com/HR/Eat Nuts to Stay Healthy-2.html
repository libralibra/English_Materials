<p>People have long known that nuts are part of a healthy diet. However, scientists in the Netherlands recently found that you do not need to eat many to get all the health benefits.</p>
<p>The researchers found that eating a handful of nuts or peanuts every day is linked to a lower risk of death from several major diseases.</p>
<p>Piet van den Brandt, a professor of epidemiology at Maastricht University, led the research. He says that eating nuts protects the health of both men and women.</p>
<p>"Nut intake seemed to be protective for both men and women, and that was on total mortality&#151;any cause of death."</p>
<p>Professor van den Brandt adds that you do not need as many nuts as health experts earlier suggested.</p>
<p>"What we found is that the beneficial effect(s) of nuts and peanuts is already apparent at a lot lower levels of intake than has been suggested before."</p>
<p>About 10 grams a day is enough to get the full health benefits of nuts. That is about an average-sized handful.</p>
<p>Nuts are high in fat and calories. So, eating a handful before dinner can help you to eat less. But eating too many can ruin your appetite altogether.</p>
<p>However, the researchers found that many peanut butters did not give the same health benefits as plain peanuts. That is because most peanut butters contain added oils and sugars.</p>
<p>Also, when choosing which nuts to eat, avoid those stored or roasted in oil. Dry-roasted is better but still the high temperatures can kill the healthy nutrients. Nuts are most healthy if you eat them raw.</p>
<p class="subTitle">Not all nuts are created equal </p>
<p>Nuts differ in their fat and nutrient content.</p>
<p>Almonds are among the least fatty nuts. Almonds also have calcium and are high in Vitamin E. Vitamin E helps to protect the body from disease. And it's good for skin and eyes.</p>
<p>Chestnuts are the nut with the least fat and fewest calories. Chestnuts are rich in carbohydrates and fiber. And in their raw form, chestnuts are a good source of vitamin C. Roasted chestnuts are a popular treat in the winter.</p>
<p>If you do not eat meat, cashews are a good substitute. Cashews have lots of protein and minerals, like iron and zinc. They also have the mineral magnesium, which may help to improve memory.</p>
<p>Walnuts are loaded with antioxidants, compounds that may help protect against cancer. They are also loaded with heart-friendly fats and omega-3s. So, walnuts are a good choice for people who do not eat fish.</p>
<p>Pecans are good if you want to feel less tired and pistachios can help balance your hormone levels.</p>
