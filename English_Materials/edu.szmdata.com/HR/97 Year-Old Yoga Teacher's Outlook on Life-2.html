<p>There is a woman named Tao Porchon-Lynch. She was born in India in 1918. So, if you do the math ... she's 97.</p>
<p>And at 97 years <i>young</i>, she has been recognized as the world's oldest yoga teacher. She has been teaching yoga, full-time, since 1967.</p>
<p>But that's not all she's done.</p>
<p>She's also been a model, actress and dancer. And she is a firm believer in positive thinking. Dream the impossible dream, kind of thinker.</p>
<p>"I'm not interested in what I can't do. Nothing is impossible."</p>
<p>Tao not only talks the talk, she walks the walk. Or rather dances the dance. At age 85 she not only learned how to dance, she won dance competitions.</p>
<p>And she offers this advice to the young. "Don't put off tomorrow what you can do today."</p>
<p>"Don't procrastinate. Tomorrow never comes."</p>
<p>So, what about retirement? At 97, she is well past the age when many people make retirement plans. Retiring, it turns out, is not Tao's style.</p>
<p>"A little girl 6 years old said to me, 'Tao, what are you going to do when you retire?'"</p>
<p>Tao told the little girl that she has no plans to retire but instead will dance her way to the next planet.</p>
