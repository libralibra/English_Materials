	<p>Recently, Baltimore, Maryland, became the largest city in the United States to ban restaurants from including sodas and other sugary drinks on their menus for children.</p>
	<p>Now, Baltimore's restaurants can only offer milk, water or 100 percent fruit juice as drinks with meals meant for children.</p>
	<p>At places to eat in the city, boys and girls can still drink soda. But an adult will have to order it for them.</p>
	<p>Restaurants failing to obey the new law face a $100 fine.</p>
	<p>Doctor Leana Wen is Baltimore's Health Commissioner. She said that the "law will help families make the healthy choice the easy choice."</p>
	<p>"The science is clear," Wen said. "One of the biggest contributors to childhood obesity is sugary drinks." She added that "childhood obesity is a major risk factor for diabetes, heart disease and early death."</p>
	<p>The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that, in Baltimore, one in three school-aged children is obese. CDC officials define obesity as weight that is higher than what is considered as a healthy weight for a given height.</p>
	<p>A federal study of Baltimore showed that about one in four schoolchildren drink soda every day.</p>
	<p>The America Heart Association suggests that children two years of age and older drink no more than one 227-gram soda per week.</p>
	<p>The CDC website states that nationwide "the percentage of children and adolescents affected by obesity has more than tripled since the 1970s. Records from 2015 and 2016 show that nearly 1 in 5 school-age children and young people (6 to 19 years) suffer from obesity.</p>
	<p>The Restaurant Association of Maryland opposes the new law. It says Baltimore's restaurants are already facing enough business challenges. It warns the law will make those challenges even worse.</p>
	<p>Other smaller U.S. cities&#151;seven in California and one in Colorado&#151;have already banned sodas from children's restaurant menus. However, Baltimore is the first large city to take this step.</p>
	<p>Whether or not such bans are approved in other cities, both large and small, remains to be seen.</p>
