<p>We started talking last week about how to decide if a common injury -- a bleeding cut on a finger -- requires medical attention. If the bleeding stops when you press on it for a few minutes, then you probably do not need a doctor. But if the injury is more serious, then you could suffer permanent damage unless you get help.</p>

<p>Dr. Martin Brown is chairman of emergency medicine at Inova Alexandria Hospital in Virginia. He says injuries that damage a "deep structure" like a bone, tendon or nerve should always be treated by a doctor.</p>

<p>MARTIN BROWN: "When deep structures are involved, it's a different ballgame."</p>

<p>Forceful bleeding and bright red blood are dangerous signs of a deep cut. Dr. Brown says there are different medical products that can help stop the bleeding. One example is Gelfoam.</p>

<p>MARTIN BROWN: "Gelfoam is a cellulose product that promotes the clotting of blood by giving blood sort of a matrix upon which to clot."</p>

<p>The traditional way to close a serious cut is with sutures, also known as stitches. A needle and nylon thread are used to sew the edges of the wound together.</p>

<p>But Dr. Brown says a more recent development is a medical glue.</p>

<p>MARTIN BROWN: "That's a glue that's very similar if not identical to super glue, but it's a sterile form of that."</p>

<p>Super glue makes many things stick together. But Dr. Brown says people should not use it on injuries. He says the medical glue can be used when a cut is straight and comes together easily.</p>

<p>The American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons has advice on its website about what to do if a fingertip is not just cut but cut off.</p>

<p>First, gently clean the amputated part with water or saline. Dr. Brown says people can use a saline cleaner for contact lenses. Saline contains salt.</p>

<p>Next, without drying the fingertip, cover the part in gauze or a cloth. Place it in a waterproof bag and place the bag on ice. Do not put the amputated part itself directly on ice. That could damage it more.</p>

<p>Bring the fingertip to a hospital as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>A surgeon may try to reattach a fingertip that is cut off below the first joint. But Dr. Brown says fingertips are not often reattached if they are the length of a fingernail or shorter.</p>

<p>He says a reattachment operation can take many hours.</p>

<p>MARTIN BROWN: "It's not a simple procedure by any means. It's done under a microscope, reattaching nerves and arteries and tendons."</p>

<p>Even then, he says, the result will not necessarily be better than losing part of a finger. Dr. Brown says patients must also be willing to undergo a rehabilitation process to regain use of the finger.</p>

<p>MARTIN BROWN: "Reattachment is a real commitment by the patient and the doctor. Amputation is a simple thing."</p>
