<p>Rachel Valltos and Evan Sapperstein are dentists who share an office and a life together. In nine years of marriage, they have built not just a successful dental practice, but also a family.</p>

<p>Rachel and Evan laugh about the last time they argued at their Washington-area home. He wanted her attention. So did one of their three children. Evan yelled at the child.</p>

<p>Rachel told Evan that he was the one acting like a baby. That only brought more yelling, which Rachel ignored.</p>

<p>RACHEL VALLTOS: "In the heat of the argument, I usually will back away because I want to avoid confrontation in front of the children. But I always have plans to go back and have a discussion about it later."</p>

<p>Rachel and Evan made peace. But researchers might describe the way she dealt with the argument at first as a withdrawal strategy.</p>

<p>A team at the University of Michigan recently published a study of how married couples fight. They also looked at how different "styles" of arguing might predict the future of a marriage.</p>

<p>The findings appeared in the Journal of Marriage and Family.</p>

<p>The study followed three hundred seventy-three couples over sixteen years. Forty-six percent of them had divorced by the final year in two thousand two.</p>

<p>The couples were asked at four different times to report on their most recent conflict. First, they had to agree on which conflict was their most recent.</p>

<p>The husbands and wives each had to choose from a list of behaviors to describe the strategies they used. The list included behaviors like calm discussion, listening and trying hard to find out the other person's feelings.</p>

<p>The list also included behaviors like yelling, using insults, walking away or not communicating -- in other words, the silent treatment.</p>

<p>Assistant professor Kira Birditt led the study.</p>

<p>KIRA BIRDITT: "The husbands were more likely to use the constructive strategies like discussing the problem, finding solutions, and wives were more likely to use those destructive or withdrawal strategies."</p>

<p>But Professor Birditt says the study found that over time, wives became less destructive in the way they argued. Husbands stayed the same.</p>

<p>KIRA BIRDITT: "It looked like wives got better at dealing with conflict over time using the fewer destructive and withdrawal strategies."</p>

<p>She says the researchers also found that different combinations of strategies may help predict whether a couple will stay together. The chances decrease if only one partner uses constructive strategies.</p>

<p>KIRA BIRDITT: "Try as you might to use the constructive strategy, you have to have both partners using that strategy."</p>

<p>So now back to Evan and Rachel. We spoke with Doctor Sapperstein just after he finished a long, difficult root canal on a patient. If he had to choose between another operation like that or a fight with his wife?</p>

<p>EVAN SAPPERSTEIN: "Oh, definitely, the root canal."</p>
