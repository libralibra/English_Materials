<p>In 2017, eleven million deaths worldwide were linked to people eating diets high in sugar, salt and processed meat.</p>
<p>Those foods were partly to blame for heart disease, cancer and diabetes, a new study found.</p>
<p>The study is called the Global Burden of Disease. It followed eating trends in 195 countries from 1990 to 2017. The findings were reported in the publication <i>The Lancet.</i></p>
<p>Researchers considered 15 dietary elements, such as diets low in fruits, vegetables, whole grains and milk. They also looked at diets high in red meat, processed meat, sugar-sweetened drinks and sodium.</p>
<p>The study found that Uzbekistan had the highest percentage of diet-related deaths.</p>
<p>Israel had the lowest proportion of diet-related deaths, while the United States rated 43<sup>rd </sup>in the study.</p>
<p>Consumption of foods such as nuts and seeds, milk and whole grains was on average too low, the researchers found. </p>
<p>Chris Murray is director of the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington, which led the work.</p>
<p>"Poor diet is responsible for more deaths than any other risk factor in the world," he said.</p>
<p>The study found people ate only 12 percent of the recommended amount of nuts and seeds&#151;an average intake of 3 grams a day. For good health, experts say, you should eat 21 grams of nuts and seeds every day.</p>
<p>The study also found that people drank more than 10 times the recommended amount of sugary drinks.</p>
<p>Another study published in January suggested an "ideal diet" for the health of people and the planet would include a doubling of the consumption of nuts, fruits, vegetables and legumes. Such a diet would also include reducing by half the amount of meat and sugar consumed.</p>
