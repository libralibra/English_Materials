	<p>During the past 30 years or so, health care has increasingly become a form of business. In addition, the environment surrounding health care has been greatly altered by the advent of more sophisticated medical technologies and increased specialization. It is no longer true to say that doctors regard their profession as a sacred calling, and while the doctor-patient relationship still remains, it is not the relationship based solely on trust which it used to be. Of course there are many doctors who have endeavored to increase the transparency of their behavior as medical professionals, and patients can receive effective treatment when such doctors work closely together and share notes.</p>
	<p>An example of such cooperation can be found in the field of remote health care, which has been introduced on an experimental basis in several regions. Since most medical specialists live in cities, patients who live in the country have to travel a long distance to consult a specialist. This is especially hard on the elderly, both financially and physically. Through a computer network, patients who live in the country can consult a medical specialist in the city, tell him their symptoms, and receive advice without the need for a journey to the specialist's office. Also, with several doctors being assigned to a single patient, the transparency of each doctor's behavior is further ensured.</p>
	<p>On the other hand, however, it is also true that remote health consultation is not generally regarded as a form of medical treatment. For any sort of consultation to be regarded as medical treatment, most people feel that the patient must actually visit the doctor, and undergo an examination by the doctor in person. Remote health care is essentially a means for doctors to work as a team. In order for this to be practicable, it is important to establish a system whereby financial support can be extended to a doctor who as a member of a medical team provides only information. Establishment of such a system will further advance the cause of "free access to information" in the health care field.</p>
