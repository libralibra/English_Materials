	<p>Children are spending an increasing amount of time using computers. Computers are now found in most classrooms, and in the majority of homes, almost always with internet access. However, many studies of children's use of computers show that there are possible negative effects. This essay will explain the possible negative effects of computer use on children, focusing on the effects on family and peer relationships and the increased tendency towards violent behavior.</p>
	<p>Computer use may negatively affect the social relationship between children and their parents. Because children spend so much time on computers, they often know more about advanced computer use than their parents. According to Subrahmanyam and his colleagues(2001) this often leads to a role reversal, where the child becomes a teacher to the parent. In other words, it is often the case that a highly computer literate teenager will teach their parents how to use the more complex functions of computer technology. This can lead to a reduction in parental authority. Moreover, with the anonymity of online communication, computer users do not know if they are talking to a child or an adult, so all users are treated equally (Subrahmanyam et al, 2001). Children may then expect the same equality in real life, further contributing to a breakdown in the parent-children relationship (Subrahmanyam et al, 2001).</p>
	<p>Children's peer relationships can also be negatively affected by extensive computer use. Since computers are more likely to be used in isolation by children, they spend little time interacting with their peers (Shields &amp; Behrman, 2001). As a result, children may not develop the social skills they need, or be able to maintain friendships in the real world (Subrahmanyam et al, 2001). With the very extended computer use, this isolation from the real world can lead to loneliness and even depression (Shields &amp; Behrman, 2001).</p>
	<p>A disturbing possible effect of computer use on children is the link between computer games and violence. Current research has already documented a strong link between violent films and television and aggressive behavior in children, so it is reasonable to believe that a similar link will be found between violent behavior in children and violence in computer games (Subrahmanyam et al, 2001). However, as Shields Behrman (2001) points out, it is important to note that although the games may affect all children, children who prefer violent games could be most affected.</p>
	<p>In conclusion, using a computer, particularly for extended periods, may affect the parent-children relationship in families. It could also result in children not learning the social skills they need to interact with peers and maintain friendships. Moreover, it seems likely that playing violent computer games is linked to violence in children. Although the research is not conclusive, it appears that extended use of computers could have a negative effect on children's social development.</p>
