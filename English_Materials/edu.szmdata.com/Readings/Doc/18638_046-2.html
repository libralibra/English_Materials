	<p>WELL&#151;do they or don't they? For years, controversy has raged over whether the electromagnetic fields produced by power lines could cause cancer, especially leukemia in young children. But in Britain last week, confusion reached new heights.</p>
	<p>One team from Bristol announced that it had evidence to back a controversial but plausible theory which would explain how power lines might cause cancer (electric fields attract airborne pollutants). Only to be followed by the release of results by another group in London which suggested there is nothing to worry about. What is going on?</p>
	<p>Actually, the confusion may be more apparent than real. There can be no doubt that the effects of power lines on water droplets, pollutants and naturally occurring radon uncovered by the Bristol team are real and interesting. But to suggest that they have anything to do with leukemia in children is premature. The extra exposure to pollution for child living near power lines would be tiny, and it is not obvious why radon&#151;a gas normally associated with lung cancer&#151;would cause leukemia in children.</p>
	<p>The second study, which drew reassuring blank, is the world's biggest ever probe of the statistical link between childhood cancers and magnetic fields of the sort produced by power lines and electrical appliances. It is one of several recent studies that have failed to find a link. Unlike earlier research, these newer studies involved going into homes to measure the electromagnetic fields. The fields they measured included input from major power lines if they were nearby.</p>
	<p>Which is not to say the research is perfect. Critics argue that Britain's childhood cancer study, for example, has not yet taken into account the surges in exposure that might come from, say, switching appliances on and off. And some people might wonder why measurements of the electric fields that are also produced by power lines did not figure in last week's study. But neither criticism amounts to a fatal blow. Electrical fields cannot penetrate the body significantly, for example.</p>
	<p>A more serious concern is whether the British research provides an all clear signal for such countries as the U.S. where power lines carry more current and therefore produce higher magnetic fields. Pedants would conclude that it doesn't. But these countries will not have long to wait for answers from a major Japanese study.</p>
	<p>In Britain, the latest epidemiological study can be taken as the final word on the matter. If the electromagnetic fields in Britain homes can in some unforeseen way increase the risk of cancer, we can now be as certain as science allows that the increase is too tiny to measure.</p>
