	<body>
	<p>You feel generally depressed and unable to concentrate. Your <u>&#160;51&#160;</u> of daily activity may change: you find yourself <u>&#160;52&#160;</u> and active in the middle of the night; you sleep late into the day, when most others are working. You stay in your room and have little contact with people <u>&#160;53&#160;</u> with those who speak your language. In your mind&#151;they are rude, loud, unfriendly, uninformed, concerned with insignificant things, <u>&#160;54&#160;</u> stupid; you complain about them to any friends you have. You become <u>&#160;55&#160;</u> when you can't go into a restaurant and order the type of food you really like; you get angry when the TV news contains mostly U.S. news and very little about events that are important to you. You are constantly making comparison between life here and the perfect life <u>&#160;56&#160;</u> home. Above all, you are homesick almost all the time.</p>
	<p>If you ever find yourself behaving in ways <u>&#160;57&#160;</u> these, you are probably suffering from culture shock. Culture shock is a psychological <u>&#160;58&#160;</u> that sometimes has physical effects. It affects people who have moved away from an environment where they know how to live <u>&#160;59&#160;</u> a new environment where much is unfamiliar to them&#151;the food, the weather, the language, and especially the <u>&#160;60&#160;</u> rules for social behavior that few people are consciously aware of.</p>
