	<p>Culture shock might be called an occupational disease of people who have been suddenly transplanted abroad. Like most ailments, it has its own symptoms and cure.</p>
	<p>Culture shock is precipitated by the <u>&#160;51&#160;</u> that results from losing all our familiar signs and symbols of social intercourse. Those signs or cues include the thousand and one ways in which we <u>&#160;52&#160;</u> ourselves to the situation of daily life: when to shake hands and what to say, when we meet people, when and how to give tips, how to make purchases, when to accept and when to <u>&#160;53&#160;</u> invitations, when to take statements seriously and <u>&#160;54&#160;</u>. These cues, which may be words, gestures, facial expressions, customs, or norms, are acquired by all of us in the course of growing up and are <u>&#160;55&#160;</u> a part of our culture as the language we speak or the beliefs we accept. All of us depend <u>&#160;56&#160;</u> our peace of mind and our efficiency on hundreds of these cues, most of which we do not carry <u>&#160;57&#160;</u> conscious awareness.</p>
	<p>Now when an individual enters a strange culture, all or most of these familiar cues are <u>&#160;58&#160;</u>. He or she is like a fish out of water. No matter how broadminded or full of goodwill you may be, a series of props have been knocked <u>&#160;59&#160;</u> you, followed by feeling of frustrations and anxiety. People react to the frustration in much the same way. First they reject the environment which causes the discomfort. "The ways of the host country are bad because they make us feel bad." When foreigners in a strange hand get together to grouse about the <u>&#160;60&#160;</u> country and its people, you can be sure they are suffering from culture shock.</p>
