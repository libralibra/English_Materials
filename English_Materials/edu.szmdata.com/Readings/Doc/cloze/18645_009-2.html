	<p>For years, scientists have been warning us that the radiation from mobile phones is detrimental to our health, without actually having any evidence to back these claims up. However, research now suggests that mobile phone radiation has at least one positive side effect: it can help prevent Alzheimer's, as well in the mice that acted as test subjects. It's been suspected, though never proven, that heavy use of mobile phone is bad for your health. It's thought that walking around with a cellphone permanently attached to the side of your head is almost sure to be blocking your brain. And that may well be true, but I'd rather wait until it's proven before giving up that part of my daily life.</p>
	<p>But what has now been proven, in a very perfunctory manner, is that mobile phone radiation can have an effect on your brain. Except in this case it was a positive rather than negative effect.</p>
	<p>According to BBC News, the Florida Alzheimer's Disease Research Center conducted a study on 96 mice to see if the radiation given off by mobile phone could affect the onset of Alzheimer's.</p>
	<p>Some of the mice were "genetically altered to develop beta-amyloid plagues in their brains" <u>&#160;1&#160;</u> they aged. These are a marker of Alzheimer's. All 96 mice were then "exposed to the elector-magnetic <u>&#160;2&#160;</u> generated by a standard phone for two one-hour periods each day for seven to nine months." The lucky things. Amazingly, the experiment showed that the mice altered to be predisposed to dementia were protected from the disease if exposed before the onset of the illness. Their cognitive abilities were so unimpaired as to be virtually identical to the mice not genetically altered in any way. Unfortunately, although the results are positive, the scientists don't actually know why exposed to mobile phone radiation has this effect. But it's hoped that further study and testing could result in a non-invasive method for preventing and treating Alzheimer's disease. Autopsies carried out on the mice also concluded no ill-effects of their exposure to the radiation. However, the fact that the radiation prevented Alzheimer's means mobile phones do affect our brains and bodies in ways not yet explored. And it's sure there are negatives as well as this one positive.</p>
