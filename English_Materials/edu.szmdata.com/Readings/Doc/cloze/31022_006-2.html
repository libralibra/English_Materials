	<p>Some names never seem to go out of style, like David or Emily. Some never really <u>&#160;51&#160;</u> Not many girls are named Laurel, <u>&#160;52&#160;</u> fewer are named lauryl sulfate. And now a study in the May 5th issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences shows that <u>&#160;53&#160;</u> a name gains in popularity, the more rapidly it falls.</p>
	<p>The authors were interested in why products or cultural phenomena <u>&#160;54&#160;</u> Are they displaced by the Next Big Thing? Or do they fade away, leaving behind a void that <u>&#160;55&#160;</u> by something.</p>
	<p>Well, one cultural taste that's easy to catalogue is <u>&#160;56&#160;</u> we name our kids. So the researchers looked at the <u>&#160;57&#160;</u> of baby names in France and the US over the past 100 years. And they found that names that enjoy a meteoric rise&#151;Madison and Brittany come to mind&#151;fall from the charts just as quick.</p>
	<p>The scientists also asked <u>&#160;58&#160;</u> couples what names they'd consider inflicting on their children, and found that most parents tend to avoid names they feel are too "faddish," <u>&#160;59&#160;</u> that became overnight sensations, like Kristi and Cody. So those names soon disappear, <u>&#160;60&#160;</u> could mean that the world may be safe from Cody Juniors.</p>
