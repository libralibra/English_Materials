	<p>What draws my firm's attention is the design of cities. When we designed America's first "green" office building two decades ago, we felt very <u>&#160;51&#160;</u>. But today, the idea that buildings can be good for people and the environment will be increasingly influential in years to come.</p>
	<p>Back in 1984 we discovered that most manufactured products for decoration weren't designed for <u>&#160;52&#160;</u> uses. The "energy-efficient" buildings constructed after the 1970s energy crisis revealed indoor air quality problems caused by materials such as paints and carpet. So, we've been focusing on these materials <u>&#160;53&#160;</u> to the molecules, looking for ways to make them safe for people and the planet.</p>
	<p>Home builders can now use materials that don't <u>&#160;54&#160;</u> the quality of the air, water, or soil. <u>&#160;55&#160;</u> our basic design strategy is focused not simply on being  "less bad",  but on creating completely healthful materials that can be either safely returned to the soil <u>&#160;56&#160;</u> reused by industry again. In fact, the world's largest manufacturer has already <u>&#160;57&#160;</u> a fully and safely recyclable carpet.</p>
	<p>No one <u>&#160;58&#160;</u> to create a building that destroys the planet. But our current industrial systems are inevitably causing these conditions. So <u>&#160;59&#160;</u> simply trying to reduce the damage, we are adopting a positive approach. We're giving people healthful products and an opportunity to make choices that have a <u>&#160;60&#160;</u> effect on the world. It's not just the building industry. Entire cities are taking these environmentally positive approaches to design, planning and building.</p>
