	<p>Alzheimer's disease (AD), also known in medical literature as Alzheimer disease, is the most common form of dementia. There is no cure for the disease, which worsens as it <u>&#160;51&#160;</u>, and eventually leads to death. It was first described by German <u>&#160;52&#160;</u> and neuropathologist Alois Alzheimer in 1906 and was named after him. Most often, AD is diagnosed in people over 65 years of age, although the less-prevalent early-onset Alzheimer's can occur much earlier. In 2006, there were 26.6 million sufferers worldwide. Alzheimer's is predicted to <u>&#160;53&#160;</u> 1 in 85 people globally by 2050.</p>
	<p>Although Alzheimer's disease <u>&#160;54&#160;</u> differently for every individual, there are many common symptoms. Early symptoms are often <u>&#160;55&#160;</u> thought to be "age-related" concerns, or <u>&#160;56&#160;</u> of stress. In the early stages, the most common symptom is difficulty with remembering recent events. When AD is <u>&#160;57&#160;</u>, the diagnosis is usually confirmed with tests that evaluate behaviour and thinking abilities, often followed by a brain scan if <u>&#160;58&#160;</u> As the disease advances, symptoms can include confusion, irritability and aggression, mood swings, trouble with language, and long-term memory loss. As the sufferer declines they often <u>&#160;59&#160;</u> from family and society. Gradually, bodily functions are <u>&#160;60&#160;</u>, ultimately leading to death.</p>
