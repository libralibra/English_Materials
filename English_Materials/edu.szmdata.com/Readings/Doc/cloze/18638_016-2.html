	<p>A study has shown that fitness is the key <u>&#160;51&#160;</u> long life, irrespective of body shape or even smoking habits. Researchers discovered that people <u>&#160;52&#160;</u> exercise live longer than those do not, <u>&#160;53&#160;</u> they are overweight and smoke.</p>
	<p>The study found that the least fit of the 6&#160;000 middle-aged men in the study were five times <u>&#160;54&#160;</u> to die within six years of the start of the research than the <u>&#160;55&#160;</u>. This was true whether or not the men had heart problems, smoked or were overweight. Scientists concluded that it was better to be fat and <u>&#160;56&#160;</u> than skinny and sedentary. Dr. Ken Cooper, a fitness expert, said, "You are better off smoking a packet of cigarettes a day and <u>&#160;57&#160;</u> regularly than being a non-smoker and sedentary." Although he adds, "But don't misunderstand me. I am not endorsing smoking. I am trying to tell you how dangerous it is to be sedentary." </p>
	<p><u>&#160;58&#160;</u>, the study appears to fly in the face of research last year which concluded that more than</p>
	<p>30&#160;000 people die prematurely every year in Britain from illnesses caused by being overweight.</p>
	<p>The British Government is putting pressure on manufacturers <u>&#160;59&#160;</u> high levels of sugar in food and to restrict the hard-sell of junk food to children in order to improve the nation's health. But the new study suggests the Government <u>&#160;60&#160;</u> more people to exercise.</p>
