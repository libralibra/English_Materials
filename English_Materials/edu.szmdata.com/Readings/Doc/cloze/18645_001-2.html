	<p>Experts say about 1% of young women in the United States are almost starving themselves today. They are suffering from a sickness called anorexia.</p>
	<p>These young women have an abnormal fear of getting fat. They <u>&#160;1&#160;</u> starve themselves so they weigh at 15% less than their normal weight.</p>
	<p>The National Institute of Mental Health says one <u>&#160;2&#160;</u> ten cases of anorexia leads to serious medical problems. These patients can die from heart failure or the disease can lead young women to <u>&#160;3&#160;</u> themselves. For example, former gymnast Christy Henrich died at age 22. She weighed only 61 pounds.</p>
	<p>A person with anorexia first develops joint and muscle problems. There is a lack of iron in the blood. As the sickness progresses, a young woman's breathing, heartbeat, and blood pressure rates slow down. The important substance calcium is <u>&#160;4&#160;</u> from the bones, something causing bones to break. Sometimes the brain gets smaller, causing changes in at a person thinks and acts. Scientists say many patients have further mental and emotional problems. They have <u>&#160;5&#160;</u> opinions about themselves. They feel helpless. Their attempts to become extremely thin may represent efforts to take control of their lives. They may <u>&#160;6&#160;</u> dependent on illegal drugs. Some people also feel the need to continually repeat a(n) <u>&#160;7&#160;</u>. For example, they may repeatedly wash their hands although their hands are clean.</p>
	<p>Anorexia is a serious eating <u>&#160;8&#160;</u>. If it is not treated on time, it can be fatal.</p>
