	<p>Experts say about 1% of young women in the United States are almost starving themselves today. They are suffering from a sickness called anorexia.</p>
	<p>These young women have an abnormal fear of getting fat. They <u>&#160;1&#160;</u> starve themselves so they weigh at 15% less than their normal weight.</p>
	<p>The National Institute of Mental Health says one in ten cases of anorexia leads to serious medical problems. These patients can die from heart failure or the disease can lead young women to kill themselves. For example, former gymnast Christy Henrich died at age 22. She weighed only 61 pounds.</p>
	<p>A person with anorexia first develops joint and muscle problems. There is a lack of iron in the blood. <u>&#160;2&#160;</u> the sickness progresses, a young woman's breathing, heartbeat, and blood pressure rates slow down. The important substance calcium is lost from the bones, something causing bones to break. Sometimes the brain gets smaller, causing changes in how a person thinks and acts. Scientists say many patients have further mental and emotional problems. They have <u>&#160;3&#160;</u> opinions about themselves. They feel helpless. Their attempts to become extremely thin may represent efforts to take control of their lives. They may become dependent on illegal drugs. Some people also feel the need to continually repeat an action. For example, they may repeatedly wash their hands although their hands are clean.</p>
	<p>Anorexia is a serious eating disorder. If it is not treated on time, it can be fatal.</p>
