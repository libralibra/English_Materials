	<p>Humans are the only species known to have consciousness, awareness that we have brains and bodies <u>&#160;51&#160;</u> adaptability that we can affect the course our lives take, that we can make choices <u>&#160;52&#160;</u> that vastly affect the quality of our lives&#151;biologically, intellectually, environmentally, and spiritually. As humans, we have the ability to mold our <u>&#160;53&#160;</u> beings to become what or who we wish to become. While some of us may, <u>&#160;54&#160;</u> , have genetic and biological imperatives that may require medication or training to overcome, or at least to modulate, the vast majority of us do, in fact, hold our emotional <u>&#160;55&#160;</u> in our hands.</p>
	<p>All that <u>&#160;56&#160;</u> , until the last decade, scientists believed that the human brain and its connections were formed during gestation and infancy and remained <u>&#160;57&#160;</u> unchanged through childhood. They believed that humans had a given number of neurons in a specific brain structure, and <u>&#160;58&#160;</u> the number might vary among people, once you were done with childhood development, you were set in this <u>&#160;59&#160;</u> . Your connections were already made, and the learning and growing period of your brain was over. In the last decade, however, researchers have found <u>&#160;60&#160;</u> evidence that this is not so, and that something called neuroplasticity continues throughout our lives.</p>
