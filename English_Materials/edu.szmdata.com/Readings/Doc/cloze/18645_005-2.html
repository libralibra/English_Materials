	<p>My father was <u>&#160;1&#160;</u> a strong man who loved being active, but a terrible illness <u>&#160;2&#160;</u> all that away. Now he can no longer walk. And he must sit quietly in a chair all day. Even talking is <u>&#160;3&#160;</u>. One night, I went to visit him with my sisters, we started talking about life, and I told them about one of my <u>&#160;4&#160;</u>. I said that we must always give things up as we grow&#151;our youth, our beauty, our friends&#151;but it always <u>&#160;5&#160;</u> that after we give something up, we gain something new in its place. Then suddenly my father spoke up. He said, "But, Peter. I gave up <u>&#160;6&#160;</u>! What did I gain?" I thought and thought, but I could not think of anything to say.</p>
	<p><u>&#160;7&#160;</u>, he answered his own question; "I gained the love of my family." I looked at my sisters, and saw tears in their eyes, along with hope and thankfulness.</p>
	<p>I was also <u>&#160;8&#160;</u> by his words. After that, when I began to fell irritated someone. I would remember his words and become <u>&#160;9&#160;</u>. If he could replace his great pain with a feeling of love for others, then I should be able to give up my small irritations. In this way, I learned the power of acceptance from my father.</p>
	<p>Sometimes I <u>&#160;10&#160;</u> what other things I could learned from him if I had listened more carefully when I was a boy. For now, though, I am grateful for this gift.</p>
