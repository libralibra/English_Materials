	<p>Healthy guilt is a warning signal that either something dangerous is about to happen or something has already happened that needs <u>&#160;51&#160;</u> A feeling of distress is good when it keeps us from <u>&#160;52&#160;</u> our own values. It serves a useful function. Here is a(n) <u>&#160;53&#160;</u>: If a fire broke out in someone's home due to faulty wiring, he would not be content with <u>&#160;54&#160;</u> putting out the fire. Rather, he would have the house rewired. When we feel guilty about something, we have to make the necessary changes in our character to prevent a <u>&#160;55&#160;</u>.</p>
	<p>Unhealthy guilt is a distressful feeling which occurs without reason or persists even after appropriate steps have been taken to deal with a situation. A person with low self-esteem may react to feelings of guilt in one of two ways: <u>&#160;56&#160;</u> that he has done wrong in order to protect his fragile ego; or experience the feeling as a <u>&#160;57&#160;</u> that he is just an unworthy person. An example involves the case of Mr. L. He has a <u>&#160;58&#160;</u> with Mr. Y and exchanges angry words. Later that day, Mr. Y gets sick. Mr. L may feel that he was the cause of Mr. Y's misfortune. Mr. L feels unwarranted guilt for the misfortune and thinks that his angry feelings caused the misfortune. This is irrational thinking and is <u>&#160;59&#160;</u> of pathological guilt.</p>
	<p>When people do research on a particular challenge and make a decision, the decision may lead to unfavorable consequences. Feeling distress and pain is normal. <u>&#160;60&#160;</u>, feeling guilty over the idea that you caused the consequences is unhealthy. As long as a decision is made with proper advice and with good intent, then the person remains morally right in having made the decision. There is no reason for guilt.</p>
