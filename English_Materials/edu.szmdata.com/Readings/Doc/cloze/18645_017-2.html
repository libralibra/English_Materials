	<p>Frank knew he was very ill. He spent days walking, sometimes as <u>&#160;1&#160;</u> as thirty miles in a day, trying to reason with the pain, and strange thoughts in his mind. Then, one night, he made up his <u>&#160;2&#160;</u> that he would go to the hospital and ask them to admit him. He reported to out-patients and asked to see a psychiatrist.</p>
	<p>A junior doctor eventually examined him and <u>&#160;3&#160;</u> to Frank's confused account of having been in hospital before, of he thought of he ought to <u>&#160;4&#160;</u> again because he was so confused and knew something was very wrong with him. The doctor did not admit him. Frank cannot remember <u>&#160;5&#160;</u> he was told that the hospital was full or that they simply did not believe him. "I felt I was completely alone. I thought there was nobody there to help."</p>
	<p>So Frank went back on to the streets to find a future of sleeping outside, the occasional shelter in hospitals, and sometimes prison whenever he was picked up for being drunk: drunk because it was the only way he could forget his condition. Frank had sought help and been turned <u>&#160;6&#160;</u>. Thousands of others like him can find no help either. They are sufferers from long-term <u>&#160;7&#160;</u> illness that confuse the minds of their victims.</p>
