	<p>Hepatitis B is a liver disease caused by the hepatitis B virus (HBV). The virus interferes with the functions of the liver and causes <u>&#160;51&#160;</u> damage. A small percentage of infected people cannot get rid of the virus and become <u>&#160;52&#160;</u> infected&#151;these people are at higher risk of death from cirrhosis of the liver and liver cancer.</p>
	<p>HBV is spread <u>&#160;53&#160;</u> blood or body fluids of an infected person&#151;the same way as the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). However, HBV is 50 to 100 times more infectious than HIV. The main ways of <u>&#160;54&#160;</u> HBV are A) from mother to baby at the birth (perinatal), B) from child-to-child, C) unsafe injections and transfusions, and D) unprotected sexual contact. Worldwide, most infections occur from mother-to-child, from child-to-child (especially in household settings), and from reuse of <u>&#160;55&#160;</u> needles and syringes. Before the widespread use of the hepatitis B vaccine, almost all children in developing countries used to become infected with the virus.</p>
	<p>However, <u>&#160;56&#160;</u> the conventional beliefs, hepatitis B virus is NOT spread by <u>&#160;57&#160;</u> eating utensils, breastfeeding, hugging, kissing, holding hands, coughing, sneezing or by recreational use of public pools or <u>&#160;58&#160;</u>.</p>
	<p>One can protect himself/herself against hepatitis B by being <u>&#160;59&#160;</u>. The hepatitis B vaccine has an outstanding record of safety and effectiveness, and since 1982, over 1 billion <u>&#160;60&#160;</u> have been used worldwide. The vaccine is 95% effective in preventing chronic infections from developing. Protection lasts for 20 years at least, no booster is recommended by WHO as of today.</p>
