	<p>The Internet has become an indispensable part of life for many children and young people nowadays. Yet risks abound.</p>
	<p>"Children must be protected from dangerous content," whether it's pornography or <u>&#160;51&#160;</u> of violence, says Axel Kossel of C'T magazine. Software is <u>&#160;52&#160;</u> handling a portion of that effort. But ultimately parents need to be involved.</p>
	<p>Parents with limited Internet experience <u>&#160;53&#160;</u> be tempted to simply ban their children from using the Internet altogether. <u>&#160;54&#160;</u> educators <u>&#160;54&#160;</u> online security experts consider this a good solution.</p>
	<p>The <u>&#160;55&#160;</u> is to prevent the child from viewing unsuitable content. One option is programs like SafetyKid that work with so-called whitelists. These allow children to enter only the addresses for pages that they are <u>&#160;56&#160;</u> permitted to use, Kossel explains. This shielding tactic is only suitable for very young children.</p>
	<p>Programs built around blacklists sniff <u>&#160;57&#160;</u> violent or pornographic sites and block them. <u>&#160;58&#160;</u> the lists are constantly updated, they still have weaknesses: "They can't block everything, since thousands of new sites appear every day," Kossel says.</p>
	<p>There is also free parental control software available on the Internet.</p>
	<p>No program works absolutely reliably, Axel Kossel says. <u>&#160;59&#160;</u> that is because many children are savvier about the Internet than their parents. That allows them to find relatively easy ways around the software barriers.</p>
	<p>The experts instead recommend <u>&#160;60&#160;</u> a "family PC" where everyone can surf together.</p>
