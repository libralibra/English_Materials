	<p>American-made chocolate and cocoa products number in the hundreds. There is a fascinating story behind these wonderful products.</p>
	<p>The story of chocolate, <u>&#160;51&#160;</u> far back as we know it, begins with the discovery of America. Until 1492, the Old World knew <u>&#160;52&#160;</u> at all about the delicious and stimulating flavor that was to become the favorite of millions.</p>
	<p>The Court of King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella got its first look at the principal <u>&#160;53&#160;</u> of chocolate when Columbus returned in triumph from America and laid before the Spanish throne many strange and wonderful things. Among these were <u>&#160;54&#160;</u> dark brown beans that looked like almonds and seemed most unpromising. They were cocoa beans, today's source of all our chocolate and cocoa.</p>
	<p>The King and Queen never dreamed how important cocoa beans could be, and it remained for Hernando Cortez, the great Spanish explorer, to grasp the <u>&#160;55&#160;</u> possibilities of the New World offerings. <u>&#160;56&#160;</u> his conquest of Mexico, Cortez found the Aztec Indians using cocoa beans in the preparation of the royal drink, "chocolate," meaning warm liquid.</p>
	<p>However, Montezuma's chocolate was very bitter, and the Spaniards did not find it <u>&#160;57&#160;</u> their taste. To make it more <u>&#160;58&#160;</u> to Europeans, Cortez and his countrymen conceived the idea of sweetening it with cane sugar.</p>
	<p>The new drink quickly won friends, especially among the Spanish aristocracy. Spain wisely proceeded to plant cacao in its overseas colonies, <u>&#160;59&#160;</u> gave birth to a very profitable business. Remarkably enough, the Spanish succeeded in <u>&#160;60&#160;</u> the art of the cocoa industry a secret from the rest of Europe for nearly a hundred years.</p>
