	<p>The unprecedented collapse of an ice-shelf in Antarctica could indirectly lead to a significant <u>&#160;51&#160;</u> in global sea levels, researchers say.</p>
	<p>The Larsen B ice shelf covered more than 3&#160;000 square kilometers and was 200 meters thick until its northern part disintegrated in the 1990s. Three years ago, the central part also <u>&#160;52&#160;</u>.</p>
	<p>An international team of researchers used data collected from six sediment cores near the former ice shelf to show the shelf had been relatively <u>&#160;53&#160;</u> for at least 10&#160;000 years or since the last ice age. The collapse therefore goes beyond what <u>&#160;54&#160;</u> naturally at the time. Rather, the demise is likely the result of long-term thinning due to melting from underneath, as <u>&#160;55&#160;</u> short-term surface melting from global climate change, the researchers suggest.</p>
	<p>Then in five years, the shelf shrunk by 5&#160;700 square kilometers, say scientists who found the break up caused changes in currents and species in the area.</p>
	<p>"As the ice shelves are <u>&#160;56&#160;</u> the glaciers that are feeding them from the land are surging forward," said Robert Gilbert, a geography professor at Queen's University in Kingston, Ont.</p>
	<p>Glaciers are no longer being held <u>&#160;57&#160;</u> the ice shelf, and are pushing icebergs into the sea, said Gilbert, one of the co-authors of the study in Thursday's issue of the journal Nature.</p>
	<p>As the glaciers melt, global sea levels could change <u>&#160;58&#160;</u> predicted, he said. Flooding <u>&#160;59&#160;</u> result in low-lying areas.</p>
	<p>Scientists are now watching to see <u>&#160;60&#160;</u> the most southern part of the Larsen ice shelf, the coldest part of Antarctica, is going to break up.</p>
