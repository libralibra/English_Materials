	<p>In Mr. Allen's high school class, all the students have to "get married." However, the wedding ceremonies are not real ones but <u>&#160;51&#160;</u> These mock ceremonies sometimes become so <u>&#160;52&#160;</u> that the loud laughter drowns out the voice of the "minister." Even the two students getting married often begin to giggle.</p>
	<p>The teacher, Mr. Allen, believes that marriage is a difficult and serious business. He wants young people to understand that there are many changes that <u>&#160;53&#160;</u> take place after marriage. He believes that the need for these psychological and financial <u>&#160;54&#160;</u> should be understood before people marry.</p>
	<p>Mr. Allen doesn't only introduce his students to major problems <u>&#160;55&#160;</u> in marriage such as illness or unemployment. He also exposes them to nitty-gritty problems they will face every day. He wants to introduce young people to all the trials and <u>&#160;56&#160;</u> that can strain a marriage to the breaking point. He even <u>&#160;57&#160;</u> his students with the problems of divorce and the fact that divorced men must pay child support money for their children and sometimes pay monthly alimony to their wives.</p>
	<p>It has been upsetting for some of the students to see the problems that a married couple often faces. <u>&#160;58&#160;</u> they took the course, they had not worried much about the problems of marriage. However, both students and parents feel that Mr. Allen's course is valuable and have <u>&#160;59&#160;</u> the course publicly. Their statements and letters supporting the class have, <u>&#160;60&#160;</u> the school to offer the course again.</p>
