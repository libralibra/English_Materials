	<p>Fear is often a <u>&#160;51&#160;</u> emotion. When you become frightened, many physical changes occur within your body. Your heartbeat and <u>&#160;52&#160;</u> quicken; your pupils expand to admit more light; large quantities of energy-producing adrenaline are poured into your bloodstream. <u>&#160;53&#160;</u> a fire or an accident, fear can <u>&#160;54&#160;</u> life-saving flight. Similarly, when a danger is psychological rather than physical, fear can force you to take self-protective measures. It is only when fear is disproportional to the danger <u>&#160;55&#160;</u> that it becomes a problem.</p>
	<p>Some people are simply more vulnerable <u>&#160;56&#160;</u> fear than others. A visit to the newborn nursery of any large hospital will demonstrate that, from the moment of their births, a few fortunates respond calmly to sudden fear-producing situations such as a loudly slammed door. Yet a neighbor in the next bed may cry out with profound fright. From birth, he or she is more <u>&#160;57&#160;</u> learn fearful responses because he or she has inherited a tendency to be more <u>&#160;58&#160;</u>.</p>
	<p>Further, psychologists know that our early experiences and relationships strongly <u>&#160;59&#160;</u> and determine our later fears. A young man named Bill, for example, grew up with a father who regarded each adversity as a <u>&#160;60&#160;</u> obstacle to be overcome with imagination and courage. Using his father as a model, Bill came to welcome adventure and to trust his own ability to solve problems.</p>
