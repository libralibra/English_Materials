	<p>There are red faces at one of Britain's biggest banks recently. They had accepted a telephone order to buy $100&#160;000 worth of shares from a fifteen-year-old schoolboy (they thought he was twenty-one). The shares fell in value and the schoolboy was unable to <u>&#160;51&#160;</u>. The bank lost $20&#160;000 on the <u>&#160;52&#160;</u> that it cannot get back because, for one thing, this young speculator does not have the money and, for another, <u>&#160;53&#160;</u> under eighteen, he is not legally liable for his debts. If the shares had risen in value by the same amount that they fell, he would have pocketed $20&#160;000 <u>&#160;54&#160;</u>. Not bad for a fifteen-year-old. It certainly is better than <u>&#160;55&#160;</u> the morning newspaper. In another recent case, a boy of fourteen found, in his grandfather's house, a suitcase full of foreign banknotes. The clean, crisp, banknotes looked very <u>&#160;56&#160;</u> but they were now not used in their country of origin or anywhere else. This young boy <u>&#160;57&#160;</u> straight to the nearest bank with his pockets filled with notes. The cashiers did not realize that the country in <u>&#160;58&#160;</u> had reduced the value of its currency by 90%. They exchanged the notes at their face value at the current exchange rate. In three days, before he was found out, he took $200&#160;000 from nine different banks. <u>&#160;59&#160;</u>, he had already spent more than half of this on taxi-rides, restaurant meals, concert tickets and presents for his many new girlfriends (at least he was generous!) before the police caught up with him. Because he is also under eighteen the banks have <u>&#160;60&#160;</u> a lot of money, and several cashiers have lost their jobs.</p>
