	<p>America is changing its eating habits. Though medical evidence mounts that we are <u>&#160;51&#160;</u> what we eat, consuming a healthier diet has become almost a national passion in the United States.</p>
	<p>The food-for-fitness phenomenon began in the late 70's when a U.S. Senate committee leading <u>&#160;52&#160;</u> the conclusion that six out of ten leading causes of death such as heart disease and cancer might <u>&#160;53&#160;</u> diet. The government issued dietary guidelines <u>&#160;54&#160;</u> Americans to eat a variety of food, maintain proper weight, and limit intake of fat, salt, and sugar.</p>
	<p>For most Americans what to eat is a matter of personal choice, <u>&#160;55&#160;</u> one of supply. An excellent nationwide food distribution system assures that fresh <u>&#160;56&#160;</u> is readily available in all parts of the country, <u>&#160;57&#160;</u> the season. Taking advantage of this abundance, many people are forsaking traditional meat-and-potatoes fare <u>&#160;58&#160;</u> lighter meals of salads, fruits, and vegetables.</p>
	<p>One of the most significant trends in the American way of eating is the healthful change in restaurant food. One of <u>&#160;59&#160;</u> two meals in the United States is eaten outside the home.</p>
	<p>Restaurants are making special efforts to provide low-fat, low-salt, and low-calorie items. Salad bars, <u>&#160;60&#160;</u> with fresh greens and raw fruits and vegetables, are found everywhere.</p>
