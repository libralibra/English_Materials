	<p>Some personal characteristics play a vital role in the development of one's intelligence. But people fail to realize the importance of cultivating these factors in young people.</p>
	<p>The so-called 'non-intelligence factors' include <u>&#160;51&#160;</u> feelings, will, motivation, interests and habits. After a 30 year follow-up study of 800 males, American psychologists found out that the main cause of disparities in intelligence is not intelligence itself, but non-intelligence factors including the desire to learn, willpower and self-confidence. Though people all know that one should have <u>&#160;52&#160;</u> objectives, a strong will and good learning habits, quite a number of teachers and parents don't pay much attention to <u>&#160;53&#160;</u> these factors.</p>
	<p>Some parents are greatly worried when their children fail to do well in their studies. They blame either genetic factors, malnutrition, or laziness, but they never take <u>&#160;54&#160;</u> consideration these non-intelligence factors. At the same time, some teachers don't inquire into these, as reasons why students do poorly. They simply give them more courses and exercises, or even rebuke or ridicule them. Gradually, these students lose self-confidence. Some of them just feel defeated and <u>&#160;55&#160;</u> themselves up as hopeless. Others may go astray because they are sick of learning.</p>
	<p>It is clear that the lack of cultivation of non-intelligence factors has been a main <u>&#160;56&#160;</u> to intelligence development in teenagers. It even causes an imbalance between physiological and psychological development among a few students.</p>
	<p>If we don't start now to <u>&#160;57&#160;</u> the cultivation of non-intelligence factors, it will not only obstruct the development of the intelligence of teenagers, but also <u>&#160;58&#160;</u> the quality of a whole generation. Some experts have put forward <u>&#160;59&#160;</u> about how to cultivate students' non-intelligence factors.</p>
	<p>Parents and teachers should fully understand teenage psychology. On this basis, they can help them to pursue the objective learning, <u>&#160;60&#160;</u> their interests and toughening their willpower.</p>
