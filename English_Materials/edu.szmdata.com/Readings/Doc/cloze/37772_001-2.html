	<p>My wife is a former semipro athlete. She was a track and field star in high school and earned a place on the Stanford University team, <u>&#160;51&#160;</u> taking second in the Pac-10 championship in the heptathlon. She made it <u>&#160;52&#160;</u> the Olympic trials before retiring, at the age of 23, due to bad knees.</p>
	<p>But even in <u>&#160;53&#160;</u>, man, could she run. In the early days of our romance, I introduced her to Ultimate Frisbee, a fledgling sport <u>&#160;54&#160;</u> a co-ed team of soccer and lacrosse refugees chase a disc around a field. Where the rest of us had two gears&#151;jogging and running&#151;my wife had something like four or five. She also had a 30-inch vertical and could outleap anyone guarding her.</p>
	<p>But soon she began spending more of each game with ice <u>&#160;55&#160;</u> around her swollen knees. Before long, her physician advised her to find a form of exercise that didn't involve running. The meniscus in each knee, after two surgeries and nearly a decade of seven-event training, is in tatters. Between now and the end of her fife, she can only hope to fight a rearguard action against pain.</p>
	<p>Each year in the U.S., 340&#160;000 people like my wife <u>&#160;56&#160;</u> knee replacements, and thousands more require meniscal repair or ACL surgery. We need new knees.</p>
	<p>Bioprinting could provide them. Researchers can now print body parts, such as skin and ears. Tissue engineering has even <u>&#160;57&#160;</u> a prototype knee meniscus. Full-fledged organs could be next. Automating their manufacture could <u>&#160;58&#160;</u> waiting on a donor list. Consider Sarah Murnaghan, a 10-year old suffering from end-stage cystic fibrosis. She had finally found a lung donor after <u>&#160;59&#160;</u> for months without hope. Many patients never find a donor. I think it's clear that this is about more than just knee joints.</p>
	<p>But knees are what I think of. My wife's Olympic dreams are over. But our two-year old daughter is already unimaginably <u>&#160;60&#160;</u> and fast. Bioprinting could give my wife&#151;and many parents&#151;the upgrade necessary to keep up.</p>
