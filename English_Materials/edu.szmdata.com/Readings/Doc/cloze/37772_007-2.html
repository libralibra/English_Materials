	<p>During a professional snowmobiling race in 2008, Mike Schultz lost control of his machine while speeding over a ragged stretch of snow. His left foot hit the ground so hard that his leg hyper-extended nearly <u>&#160;51&#160;</u> in the wrong direction, shattering his knee and forcing doctors to <u>&#160;52&#160;</u> just above the joint. "I'm looking at my wife saying, 'What are we going to do now?'" Schultz says. "I'm <u>&#160;53&#160;</u> athlete, and I'm not going to be able to do this stuff anymore."</p>
	<p>Schultz's <u>&#160;54&#160;</u> was right: Conventional prosthetic legs couldn't <u>&#160;55&#160;</u> his high-impact lifestyle. So in early 2009, he designed and built a limb that could. Its key feature was the Moto Knee, which uses an <u>&#160;56&#160;</u> 250 psi mountain bike shock absorber to <u>&#160;57&#160;</u> the joint's stiffness with compressed air. But snowboarders and skateboarders also require critical toe pressure and ankle tension, so Schultz added the Versa Foot&#151;a foot-ankle assembly that also uses a pneumatic shock absorber to <u>&#160;58&#160;</u> joint resistance. Together, the two parts complete an artificial lower limb that's impact-resistant, waterproof, and quickly customizable for a range of high-performance activities.</p>
	<p>Schultz recently returned to competition and won a gold medal at the 2013 X Games Aspen. This spring, he expects to sell his new-and-improved prosthetic not only to amputee athletes, but also to soldiers returning from <u>&#160;59&#160;</u> with missing limbs. "This whole project started out because I wanted to allow myself to do the things I wanted to do, but it's <u>&#160;60&#160;</u> way past that," Schultz says. "I'm helping people do things they haven't done since they had two good legs, and that's worth it right there."</p>
