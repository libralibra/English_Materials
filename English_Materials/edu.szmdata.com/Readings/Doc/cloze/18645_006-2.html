	<p>A study has shown that fitness is the key to long life, irrespective of body shape or even smoking habits. Researchers discovered that people who exercises live longer than those who do not, <u>&#160;1&#160;</u> they are overweight and smoke.</p>
	<p>The study found that the least fit of the 6&#160;000 middle-aged men in the study were five times <u>&#160;2&#160;</u> to die within six years of the start of the research than the <u>&#160;3&#160;</u>. This was true whether or not the men had heart problem, smoked or were overweight. Scientists concluded that it was better to be fat and <u>&#160;4&#160;</u> than skinny and sedentary. Dr. Ken Cooper, a fitness expert, said, "You are better off smoking a packet of cigarettes a day and <u>&#160;5&#160;</u> regularly than being a non-smoker and sedentary." Although he adds, "But don't misunderstand me. I am not endorsing smoking. I am trying to tell you how dangerous it is to be sedentary." <u>&#160;6&#160;</u>, the study appears to fly in the face of research last year which concluded that more than 30&#160;000 people die prematurely every year in Britain from illnesses caused by being overweight.</p>
	<p>The British Government is putting pressure on manufacturers <u>&#160;7&#160;</u> high levels of sugar in food and to restrict the hard-sell of junk food to children in order to improve the nation's health. But the new study suggests the Government <u>&#160;8&#160;</u> more people to exercise.</p>
