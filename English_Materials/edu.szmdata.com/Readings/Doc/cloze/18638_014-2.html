	<p>With 950 million people, India ranks second to China among the most populous countries. But since China <u>&#160;51&#160;</u> a family planning program in 1971, India has been <u>&#160;52&#160;</u> the gap. Indians have reduced their birth rate but not nearly as much as the Chinese have. If current growth rates continue, India's population will <u>&#160;53&#160;</u> China's around the year 2028 at about 1.7 billion. Should that happen, it won't be the <u>&#160;54&#160;</u> of the enlightened women of Kerala, a state in southern India. <u>&#160;55&#160;</u> India as a whole adds almost 20 million people a year, Kerala's population is virtually stable. The reason is no mystery: nearly two-thirds of Kerala women practice birth control, compared with about 40% in the entire nation.</p>

And an educational tradition and matrilineal customs in parts of Kerala help girls and boys get equally good schooling. While one in three Indian women is <u>&#160;57&#160;</u>, 90% of those in Kerala can read and write.</p>

"Unlike our Parents, we know that we can do more for our children if we have fewer of them," says Laila Cherian, 33, who lives in the Village of Kudamaloor. She has limited herself to three children&#151;one below the national <u>&#160;59&#160;</u> of four. That kind of restraint will keep Kerala from putting added <u>&#160;60&#160;</u> on world food supplies.</p>
