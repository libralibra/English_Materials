	<p class="z">Dear Dr. Benjamin,</p>
	<p>Congratulations on your nomination as United States Surgeon General. Based on your extraordinary career and your commitment to <u>&#160;51&#160;</u> health disparities among under-served populations, no doubt your tenure will be marked by great progress toward the goal of improved health for all Americans.</p>
	<p>Each United States Surgeon General has the unique opportunity to create his or her own lasting legacy. Dr. Koop focused on smoking prevention. Dr. Satcher, one of <u>&#160;52&#160;</u> mentors, released the first comprehensive report on mental health. We encourage you to build your own legacy <u>&#160;53&#160;</u> concept of prevention through healthy lifestyles&#151;a legacy that is both sustainable and cost-effective. This also is an important issue for Members of Congress, many of whom believe that <u>&#160;54&#160;</u> prevention and wellness initiatives will bring down costs and help people lead healthier lives. The American College Sports Medicine (ACSM) would be honored to partner with you on such an initiative.</p>
	<p>ACSM, the largest sports medicine and exercise science organization in the world, <u>&#160;55&#160;</u> ready to work with you to increase healthy behaviors&#151;especially physical activity&#151;throughout the life span. During this crucial period of health system reform, we've been advocating for strategies that support preventive medicine not just through diagnostic testing, <u>&#160;56&#160;</u> promoting healthy, active behaviors that all Americans can achieve at little or no cost.</p>
	<p>In fact, ACSM already has a working agreement with the Surgeon General's office, focused on a series of healthy-lifestyle public service announcements for our Exercise Is Medicine TM program, a program that <u>&#160;57&#160;</u> calls on doctors to encourage their patients to incorporate physical activity and exercise into their daily routine. As you are <u>&#160;58&#160;</u> aware, physical activity can prevent and treat a host of chronic conditions&#151;such as heart disease, type II diabetes, and obesity&#151;that currently plague our country. Your example as <u>&#160;59&#160;</u> whose family has suffered from preventable disease and who demonstrates healthy lifestyles can be powerful indeed.</p>
	<p>Anytime either before or after your appointment is confirmed, we would <u>&#160;60&#160;</u> the opportunity to meet with you and your staff to discuss how we, along with other leading health organizations, can enhance the prevention paradigm through physical activity.</p>
	<p>Again, Dr. Benjamin, I extend our deepest congratulations and best wishes.</p>
	<p class="r">Sincerely,</p>
	<p class="r">James Pivamik, Ph.D. ACSM</p>
	<p class="r">President, American College of Sports Medicine</p>
	</body>
