	<p>People's attitude towards drugs varies from person to person. Some <u>&#160;51&#160;</u> them as miraculous; others think of them as dangerous. Then what is the sensible attitude toward drugs?</p>
	<p>I think the first thing to think about is the difference between drugs and wonder drugs. The antibiotics can really <u>&#160;52&#160;</u> certain bacterial diseases. On the other hand, the major diseases threatening Americans today are cancer, stroke, high blood pressure, coronary disease, etc. <u>&#160;53&#160;</u> them, the doctor's bag of tricks is limited. He has no wonder drugs.</p>
	<p>So the first important lesson is not to <u>&#160;54&#160;</u> too much from drugs. If you can accept the fact that the war against many of our most devastating diseases is, at <u>&#160;55&#160;</u> a holding operation rather than an inevitable triumph, it will <u>&#160;56&#160;</u> a great deal to ease your life as well as that of your doctor. Too many <u>&#160;57&#160;</u> exert great pressures on doctors to prescribe for every symptom, even when such treatment is unwarranted or dangerous.</p>
	<p>Unfortunately, the medical profession is guilty of taking part, to a certain <u>&#160;58&#160;</u> in the wrongful action. The patient who demands a shot of penicillin for every sniffle and sneeze may be <u>&#160;59&#160;</u> the injection by a reluctant <u>&#160;60&#160;</u> because he is certain that if he does not, the patient will search until he finds a doctor who will.</p>
