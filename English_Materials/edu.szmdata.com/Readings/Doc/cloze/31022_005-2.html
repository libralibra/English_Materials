	<p>Ants have an amazing ability to communicate with each other and work together to accomplish complex tasks. Their specialized behavior <u>&#160;51&#160;</u> chemical communication is so well developed, in fact, <u>&#160;52&#160;</u> humans can learn a lot from them about how best to work in teams.</p>
	<p>British scientists at the University of Bristol are studying colonies of army ants to understand how they organize themselves and <u>&#160;53&#160;</u> knowledge. These insects&#151;which come in various sizes&#151;are known for using their bodies as living plugs to cover potholes on the rough terrain between their nest and their <u>&#160;54&#160;</u> When they encounter a hole in their path, they quickly determine which of them is the best fit. The <u>&#160;55&#160;</u> ant then lies across the gap, allowing the remainder of the group&#151;<u>&#160;56&#160;</u> 200&#160;000 other ants&#151;to step on its back. This important minority of ants optimizes the food collection of the entire colony by literally "paving the way" for the others.</p>
	<p>The <u>&#160;57&#160;</u> behavior that emerges from a group of social insects, such as ants, can be called "swarm intelligence". Swarm intelligence <u>&#160;58&#160;</u> the self-organization of many individuals that work collectively to find the best solution for a difficult problem.</p>
	<p>The <u>&#160;59&#160;</u> of swarm intelligence have been used in a variety of human applications. "Ant colony optimization" has been mimicked as a routing method that improves the <u>&#160;60&#160;</u> of cargo transfers on airplanes, and has even become a routing technique for moving data across telecommunications networks more smoothly.</p>
