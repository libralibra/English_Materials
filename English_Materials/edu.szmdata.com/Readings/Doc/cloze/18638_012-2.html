	<p>Sleep is divided into periods of so-called REM sleep, characterized by rapid eye movements and dreaming, and longer periods of non-REM sleep. <u>&#160;51&#160;</u> kind of sleep is at all well-understood, but REM sleep is <u>&#160;52&#160;</u> to serve some restorative function of the brain. The purpose of non-REM sleep is even more <u>&#160;53&#160;</u>. The new experiments, such as those <u>&#160;54&#160;</u> for the first time at a recent meeting of the Society for Sleep Research in Minneapolis, suggest fascinating explanations <u>&#160;55&#160;</u> of non-REM sleep.</p>
	<p>For example, it has long been known that total sleep <u>&#160;56&#160;</u> is 100 percent fatal to rats, yet, <u>&#160;57&#160;</u> examination of the dead bodies, the animals look completely normal. A researcher has now <u>&#160;58&#160;</u> the mystery of why the animals die. The rats <u>&#160;59&#160;</u> bacterial infections of the blood, <u>&#160;60&#160;</u> their immune systems&#151;the self-protecting mechanism against disease&#151;had crashed.</p>
