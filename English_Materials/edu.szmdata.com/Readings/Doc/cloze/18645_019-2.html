	<p>Flight simulator refers to any electronic or mechanical system for training airplane and space-craft pilots by simulating flight conditions. The purpose of simulation is not to completely substitute <u>&#160;21&#160;</u> actual flight training but to thoroughly familiarize students with the vehicle <u>&#160;22&#160;</u> before they undergo extensive and possibly dangerous actual flight training.</p>
	<p>Two early flight simulators appeared in England within a decade after the first flight of Orville and Wilbur Wright. They were designed to enable pilots to <u>&#160;23&#160;</u> simple aircraft maneuvers in three dimensions: nose up or down; left wing high and right low, or vice versa; and yawing to left or right. Until 1929, however, a truly effective simulator, the Link Trainer devised by Edwin A. Link, a self-educated aviator and inventor, appeared. <u>&#160;24&#160;</u>, airplane instrumentation had been developed sufficiently to permit "blind" flying on instruments alone, but training pilots to do so involved <u>&#160;25&#160;</u> risk. Link built a model of airplane cockpit equipped <u>&#160;26&#160;</u> instrument panel and controls that could simulate all the movements of an airplane. Plots could use the device for instrument training, manipulating the controls <u>&#160;27&#160;</u> instrument readings so as to maintain straight and level flight or controlled climb or descent with no visual reference <u>&#160;28&#160;</u> any horizon except for the artificial one on the instrument panel. The trainer was modified <u>&#160;29&#160;</u> aircraft technology advanced. Commercial airlines began to use the Link Trainer for pilot training, and the U.S. government began purchasing them in 1934, <u>&#160;30&#160;</u> thousands more as World War II approached.</p>
