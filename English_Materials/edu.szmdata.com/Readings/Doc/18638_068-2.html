	<p>Medical studies show that only two to five percent of the obese manage to shed unwanted pounds permanently. The rest, after intermittent successes, regain or surpass their starting weights within a couple of years. Why do most reducing programs fail in the long run, and so many dieters put back lost weight?</p>
	<p>Some experts claim that the gloomy estimates of dieting failure may be exaggerated, since some people do manage to keep off at least some weight, even though they may not achieve the svelte look they desire. Only those who fail dismally in their own dieting efforts enter format reduction programs. So, on an optimistic note, some health professionals point out that most studies never consider those who successfully keep weight off, don't seek medical advice and hence aren't counted in the statistics.</p>
	<p>Another explanation for failure is that diets set up unreal expectations of a magical cure, often based on absurdly monotonous meal plans that cannot possibly be followed for long. And the very idea of dieting implies a temporary effort you go on the new eating regime only to come off it. Once the diet is over and former eating habits taken up again, people often give themselves permission to binge on foods forbidden while dieting. A further obstacle to successful dieting is the exclusion of certain foods that acquire a special status. No food should be forbidden; it is better to work a little ice cream or dessert into your regime to avoid an irresistible urge to gorge on prohibited items.</p>
	<p>The all too familiar cycle of yo-yo dieting-endless diets followed by weight regain&#151;may leave dieters worse off than before. Some studies suggest that with each successive fast and feast, metabolic changes make the post-dieting weight regained higher in fat than muscle. Repeated dieting often produces depression, a sense of failure, an intense preoccupation with food, loss of self-esteem and stress from the continual deprivation.</p>
