	<p class="stems">86. The primary purpose of the passage is to ____.</p>
		<ol type="A">
			<li>expose the fragile nature of the foundations on which the high yields of modern agriculture rest</li>
			<li>argue that genetic engineering promises to lead to even higher yields than are achievable with synthetic fertilizers</li>
			<li>argue that the capacity for nitrogen-fixing symbioses is transferable to non-leguminous plants</li>
			<li key="1"><span>explain the reasons for and the objectives of current research in nitrogen-fixing symbioses</span></li>
		</ol>

	<p class="stems">87. According to the passage, there is currently no strain of <i>Rhizobium</i> that can enter into a symbiosis with ____.</p>
		<ol type="A">
			<li>alfalfa</li>
			<li>clover</li>
			<li key="1"><span>maize</span></li>
			<li>peas</li>
		</ol>

	<p class="stems">88. The most influential factor in bringing about intensified research on nitrogen fixation is ____.</p>
		<ol type="A">
			<li>the high yields of the Green Revolution</li>
			<li key="1"><span>the persistent upward surge in natural gas prices</span></li>
			<li>the variety of <i>Rhizobium</i> strains</li>
			<li>the mechanization of modern agriculture</li>
		</ol>

	<p class="stems">89. According to the passage, the ultimate goal of the current research on nitrogen fixation is to develop ____.</p>
		<ol type="A">
			<li>strains of <i>Rhizobium</i> that can enter into symbioses with existing varieties of wheat, rice, and other non-legumes</li>
			<li>strains of <i>Rhizobium</i> that produce more ammonia for leguminous host plants than do any of the strains presently known</li>
			<li>varieties of wheat, rice, and other non-legumes that yield as much as do existing varieties, but require less nitrogen</li>
			<li key="1"><span>varieties of wheat, rice, and other non-legumes that maintain an adequate symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria and produce high yields</span></li>
		</ol>

	<p class="stems">90. The author regards the research program under discussion as ____.</p>
		<ol type="A">
			<li>original and extensive but ill-defined as to method</li>
			<li key="1"><span>necessary and ambitious but vulnerable to failure</span></li>
			<li>cogent and worthwhile but severely underfunded</li>
			<li>prohibitively expensive but conceptually elegant</li>
		</ol>
