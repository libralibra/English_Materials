	<p>Edna was not in the least surprised by my offer. I hitched the traveling-can containing the food on to the carrier. I didn't want to ride on the rough approach to the house so I rolled the bicycle the short distance from the house to the mad while Edna walked beside me. Mounting the vehicle with the can on the back and Edna on the cross-bar proved a little tricky, I solved the problem by getting on the seat first and keeping the bicycle stationary with one foot resting firmly on the ground. Then Edna climbed on the bar sitting sideways; and I pushed off. The excitement of having her so close within my arms and the perfume of her hair in my nose would have proved overpowering if I'd had much time to consider it. I hadn't. The road to the hospital turned out to be quite hilly, not steep but just enough to take the wind out of one; and with the kind of passenger I had, I didn't care to admit too readily to being tired. So I raced up all the little hillocks until my heart raged like a bonfire.</p>
	<p>"You are very strong," said Edna.</p>
	<p>"Why?" I said, or rather puffed out, in one enormous expiration, as I rounded the summit of yet another small hill.</p>
	<p>"You are eating all the hills like yam."</p>
	<p>"I haven't seen any hill yet," I replied, getting back some of my breath as I pedaled freely down the small, friendly descent that followed. These words were hardly out of my mouth when a stupid sheep and her four or five lambs rushed out of the roadside on my left. I braked sharply. Unfortunately Edna's back was resting on my left arm and prevented me applying the brake on that side effectively. So only the brake on the front wheel performed fully. The bicycle pitched forward and crashed on the road. Edna was thrown farther up the road and as soon as I got up, I rushed to help her to her feet again. Then I turned to gaze at the food in the sandy road. I could have wept.</p>
	<p>I just stood looking at it and biting my lip. Then Edna burst into nervous laughter which completed my humiliation. I didn't want to look at her. Without taking my eyes from the food I murmured that I was very sorry.</p>
