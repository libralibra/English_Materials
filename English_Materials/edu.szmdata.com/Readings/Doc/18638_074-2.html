	<p>Some problems can be readily identified simply by looking around. These problems concern the pollution of our environment by technology as a result of sudden upsets in the physical, economic and social balance. The most obvious of these are the general pollution of our physical environment and the destruction of irreplaceable natural resources. Not so obvious as these, but just as painfully significant to some, are the disappearing and changing of jobs which overnight often create large groups of jobless citizens.</p>
	<p>Can technology be used to undo what it has done, replace what it has destroyed or substitute for what it has caused to disappear? No one knows. Many wonder whether or not all of the sources of pollution have yet been identified, whether or not they are being arrested and whether or not they will be prevented from recurring.</p>
	<p>Another set of problems relates to what technological advancement has done to the quality of life. An improved social life has not been unfortunately, either the goal or the chief beneficiary of technological change. Rather, any improvements that have occurred have been more accidental than intended. Too much has happened too fast. The changes demanded of marriage and family relationships remain largely unexamined. It is often a matter of "put up or shut up", and a person has to adapt his lifestyle to ever-changing conditions with little time for choice. The "no-move-no-advancement" type is an example of one such problem. Many people are coming to think that the reward is simply not worthy of the struggle, and they are taking jobs with less responsibility and lower pay.</p>
