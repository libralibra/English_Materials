	<p>Science is the 4-year pursuit of knowledge that every high school teenager must live through. I often ask myself, when will I ever need to use this stuff when I grow up? The answer is clearly, probably never. I doubt that I will ever need to know the chemical formula of dichromate, or how to correctly identify a combustion reaction. However, where would we be today, without science? Without the great minds of Einstein and Newton, where would we be? How would I be able to write this essay on the computer, if there was no science? Would I be alive today? Would humankind survive through the year and still be around today? Or would dogs be the masters of humans? Would we still be the dominant species on the Earth?</p>
	<p>So many questions arise because the human race depends on the advancement of science. We are dependent on Nabisco to make that cookie you love, 99.99% fat free, that video game company to come out with the anniversary game cartridge you want to play so badly, and that car company to alter the headlights of the car and call in the "new" 98 car.</p>
	<p>Where would we be without science? We depend on our researchers to make new vaccines and our doctors to make us the way we want ourselves to be. We depend on them to make us "prettier", to perform triple bypasses, to make sure nothing goes wrong when they operate upon us. Doctors depend on science just as much as we depend on science. Lawyers are constantly depending on doctors not knowing their science so they can get rich quick. Just look how much our society depends on the advancement of science.</p>
	<p>Science, in a way, keeps our society from falling apart. In our society, science is everywhere. Science takes part in our everyday life more than we think. We need scientific progress so that we can simply make it through a day. When most people think of science, they think of it as a laboratory, white coats, and mixing all different-colored chemicals until something blows up. But the fact is that science is a way of life and our future.</p>
