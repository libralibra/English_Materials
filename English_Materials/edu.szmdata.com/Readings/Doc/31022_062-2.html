	<p>Raymond Schneider politely elbowed his way through crowds of customers as he made for the bulk candy bins at Dylan's Candy Bar across from Bloomingdale's in Manhattan. Since he was laid off in December, Mr. Schneider, a 33-year-old interior designer, says he has become a "gummy junkie," stocking up on sweets every time he shops for groceries. "Sugar is comforting," he said, "There's nothing more stressful than growing financial insecurity everywhere."</p>
	<p>The recession seems to have a sweet tooth. As unemployment has risen and 401(k)'s have shrunk, Americans, particularly adults, have been consuming growing volumes of candy, from Mary Janes and Tootsie Rolls to Gummy Bears and cheap chocolates, say candy makers, store owners and industry experts.</p>
	<p>Theories vary on exactly why. For many, sugar lifts spirits dragged low by the languishing economy. For others, candy also provides a nostalgic reminder of better times. And not insignificantly, it is relatively cheap. "People may indulge themselves a little bit more when times are tough," said Jack P. Russo, an analyst with the Edward Jones retail brokerage in St. Louis. "These are low-cost items that people can afford pretty easily."</p>
	<p>At Candyality, a store in the Lakeview neighborhood of Chicago, business has jumped by nearly 80 percent compared with this time last year. At the Candy Store in San Francisco, the owner, Diane Campbell, has tripled her orders for nostalgic candies like Necco Wafers and Mallo Cups in recent months. Many of her customers tell her that even though they are living on less, they're setting aside cash for candy. "They put candy in their actual budget," she said.</p>
	<p>Many big candy makers are reporting rising sales and surprising profits even as manufacturers of other products are struggling to stay afloat. Cadbury reported a 30 percent rise in profits for 2008 while Nestle's profits grew by 10.9 percent, according to public filings. Hershey, which struggled for much of 2008, saw profits jump by 8.5 percent in the fourth quarter.</p>
	<p>Lindt &amp; Spr&uuml;ngli, which specializes in more expensive products like Lindt and Ghirardelli chocolate, announced that even though it expects to close some of its luxury retail stores this year, it also expects chocolate sales to remain strong through mainstream retailers like Wal-Mart and Target.</p>
	<p>"All is well in candy land," said Jamie Cohen, owner of the Sweetdish candy store. His son, Mitchell, 23, who works long hours as a Wall Street investment banker, helps out at the store on some Sundays because, he said, he finds the mood uplifting. He noted that his Wall Street co-workers have also been eating more candy: The 10-pound candy bags he puts on his desk are being devoured in one week instead of the usual two. "That's why I like going to the store on Sundays," Mitchell Cohen said. "Everyone is happy."</p>
	<p>"Candy companies are relatively recession-proof," said Peter Liebhold, chairman of the Smithsonian Institution's work and industry division. "During the Great Depression, candy companies stayed in business."</p>
