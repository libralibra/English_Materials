	<p>Although speech and writing are the special means of communicating of humans, the interchange also takes place in many other ways. A person may relay his or her feelings, thoughts, and reactions through body positioning, body contact, body odors, eye contact, responsive actions, habits, attitudes, interests, state of health, dress and grooming, choice of life-style, and use of talents&#151;in fact, through everything the individual says or does.</p>
	<p>In turn, every person is constantly receiving multitudes of external and internal messages through his or her five senses and personal biorhythm system. An individual screens, selects, regulates, and controls specific aspects of this information through a process of mental choices. Some of these choices are automatic; some are subconscious because of habit, block, or lack of development; and some are made by a conscious process. The degree to which a person is able to communicate depends upon the extent of his or her conscious awareness, priority of need, and control of this process.</p>
	<p>The person with a behavior disorder is shut off from the communicative flow that normally exists among humans. His or her mind is confused, and he or she may feel unable to express personal thoughts, needs, and emotions, and unable to make himself or herself understood. Sometimes the person may feel that he or she is communicating clearly but that others cannot or will not understand. Because the person is thus isolated in internal problems, he or she is interested only in these problems and cannot focus attention on the messages of others. The person often projects fears and fantasies onto others, so that no matter what the real content is of the messages that others relay, the messages received are threatening ones.</p>
	<p>The causes of such communicative shutoffs are blocks in the neural pathways of the person's processing of information. Sometimes a block is physical, as in deafness, mental retardation, brain tumor, or hardening of the cerebral arteries. However, the most common causes of blocks are injuries to a person's emotional system.</p>
	<p>Emotional blocks occur to some degree in all human beings. They usually occur in childhood before good communicative skills are learned, and they are connected to individual symbolism. Unless such a block is removed shortly after happening, it can have profound and complicating effects that will distort emotional and mental growth and arrest the development potential of the individual. Even though a child with blocks will appear to grow and to seem mature in some ways, he or she will show the evidence of emotional blocking in efforts to communicate.</p>
