	<p>European Union environmental officials have determined that two kinds of genetically modified corn could harm butterflies, affect food chains and disturb life in rivers and streams, and they have proposed a ban on the sale of the seeds, which are made by DuPont Pioneer, Dow Agrosciences and Syngenta. The preliminary decisions are circulating within the European Commission, which has the final say. Some officials there are skeptical of a ban that would upset the powerful biotechnology industry and could exacerbate tensions with important trading partners like the United States. The seeds are not available on the European market for cultivation.</p>
	<p>In the decisions, the environment commissioner, Stavros Dimas, contends that the genetically modified corn, or maize could affect certain butterfly species, specifically the monarch, and other beneficial insects. For instance, research this year indicates that larvae of the monarch butterflies exposed to the genetically modified corn "behave differently than other larvae." In the decision concerning the corn seeds produced by Dow and Pioneer, Mr. Dimas calls "potential damage on the environment irreversible." In the decision on Syngenta's corn, he says that "the level of risk generated by the cultivation of this product for the environment is unacceptable."</p>
	<p>A decision by the European Union to bar cultivation of the genetically modified crops would be the first of its kind in the trade block, and would intensify the continuing battle over genetically modified corn. Banning the applications for corn crops also would mark a bold new step for European environmental authorities, who are already aggressively pursuing regulations on emissions from cars and aircraft, setting it at odds with the United States and angering industries.</p>
	<p>"These products have been grown in the U.S. and other countries for years," said Stephen Norton, a spokesman for the United States trade representative. "We are not aware of any other case when a product has been rejected after having been reviewed and determined  safe" by European food safety authorities, he said.</p>
	<p>Barbara Helfferich, a spokeswoman for Mr. Dimas, declined to comment on the specifics of the procedure because commissioners had not yet made a final decision. But she said that the European Union was within its rights to make decisions based on the "precautionary principle" even when scientists had found no definitive evidence proving products can cause harm. She said that the decisions by Mr. Dimas could go before the commission within a few weeks, but she said that no date had been set. In the decisions, Mr. Dimas cited recent research showing that "consumption of genetically modified corn byproducts reduced growth and increased mortality of non-target stream insect" and that these insects "are important prey for aquatic and riparian predators" and that this could have "unexpected ecosystem-scale consequences".</p>
	<p>Although still preliminary, his decisions could drastically tilt the policy against future approvals of genetically modified crops, said Nathalie Moll, a spokeswoman for Europabio, an industry group with 80 members including Syngenta, Pioneer and Dow. Europabio says that the crops grown using the genetically modified corn are already imported into several European countries, including France and Germany, where they are used to feed animals like cows and chickens.</p>
	<p>Rob Gianfranceschi, spokesman at the United States Mission to the European Union in Brussels, said it was too early to comment on a decision that had not yet been formalized. But he made clear that the United States remained frustrated with European policies on genetically modified crops.</p>
