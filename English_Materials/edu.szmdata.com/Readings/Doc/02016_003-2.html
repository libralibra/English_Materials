	<p>Less meat and dairy in our diets could help reduce agricultural greenhouse gases by as much as 80% by 2055, according to a recent study by the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK). The researchers created global land-use model to project likely outcomes given different scenarios involving consumer dietary trends and changes in agriculture production methods. The models take into consideration population growth, the world economy, and other factors.</p>
	<p>The researchers found that, if meat and dairy consumption patterns remain constant of increase, the associated global agricultural omissions will increase significantly. On the other hand, a 25% reduction over the next 40 years would help bring levels to where they were around 1995.</p>
	<p>Methane and nitrous oxide in particular could be reduced if less meat and dairy is produced and consumed. These gases are caused largely by livestock waste and synthetic fertilizers. Around two-thirds of nitrous-oxide emissions come from agriculture&#151;and most of that as a result of either raising animals or producing the feed used to raise them. Consumers' food choices, combined with what one PIK researcher terms "technical mitigation options on the producers side" could make an enormous impact on these emissions.</p>
	<p>While not nearly as much methane or nitrous oxide is released into the atmosphere as carbon dioxide, both are significantly more potent and they form substantial pieces of the greenhouse gas pie. Both of these gases trap heat and radiation in the atmosphere much more effectively than does carbon dioxide. The U. S. Environmental Protection Agency cites methane as being "21 times more effective at trapping heat in the atmosphere than carbon dioxide over a 100-year time period." Nitrous oxide is more than 300 times more effective than CO<sub>2</sub>.</p>
	<p>While the PIK study doesn't detail exactly which consumer choices and eating habits can help reverse the trend, it seems clear that less is more when it comes to consuming meat and dairy products.</p>
