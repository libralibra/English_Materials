	<p>Once they decided to have children, Michel and Carl Meissner tackled the next big issue: Should they try to have a girl?</p>
	<p>It was no small matter. Michel's brother had become blind from a hereditary condition in his early 20s, and the Meissners had learned that the condition is a disorder passed from mothers to sons. If they had a boy, he would have a 50% chance of having the condition. A girl would be unaffected.</p>
	<p>The New Hampshire couple's inquiries about gender selection led them in 1999 to Fairfax, Va., where a new sperm-separation technique, called MicroSort, was under investigation. The couple's first attempt at artificial insemination, using sperm sorted by sex chromosome, was a failure. But on the second attempt a few months later, Michel became pregnant and gave birth to a daughter. They will try to have a second daughter using the technique later this year.</p>
	<p>"I probably would not have had children if not for MicroSort," she said. "This was pretty much our only option for kids."</p>
	<p>The technique separates sperm into two groups&#151;those that carry the X-chromosome which leads to a female baby and those that carry the Y-chromosome which produces a male baby. The process was developed in the early 1990s by the Genetics &amp; IVF Institute in Fairfax, and last week's opening of a MicroSort laboratory in Laguna Hills marks the company's first expansion.</p>
	<p>"We believe the number of people who want this technology is greater than those who have access to it," said Dr. Keith L. Blauer, the company's clinical director.</p>
	<p>The expansion brings with it not only a seemingly effective way to select a child's gender it also highlights a host of ethical and practical considerations that accompany sex selection, especially for the majority of families who use the technique for non-medical reasons.</p>
	<p>The Laguna Hills clinic, which is a joint effort with the Huntington Reproductive Center of Southern California, offers sex selection for two purposes: to help couples avoid passing on a gender-linked genetic disease and to allow families who already have a child of one gender "balance" their families by having a baby of the opposite sex.</p>
	<p>Blauer said that company has had an impressive success rate: 91 per cent of the women who become pregnant after sorting for a girl are successful, while 76 per cent who sort for a boy and get pregnant are successful.</p>
	<p>The technique separate sperm based on the fact that the X-chromosome is larger than the Y-chromosome. A machine is used to distinguish the size differences and sort the sperm accordingly.</p>
