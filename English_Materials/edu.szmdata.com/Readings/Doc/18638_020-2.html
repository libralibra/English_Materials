	<p>An abandoned airfield near a former Nazi concentration tramp may soon feature pagodas and Tai Chi parks. A $700 million project aims to give Germany its own Chinatown 22 miles north of Berlin in the town of Oranienburg, housing 2&#160;000 residents by 2010.</p>
	<p>The investor group behind the scheme hopes the new Chinatown will attract tourists and business to rival the famed Chinatowns of San Francisco and New York by delivering an "authentic Chinese experience." "You'll be able to experience China, go out for a Chinese meal, and buy Chinese goods," says Stefan Kunigam, managing director of Bandenburg-China-Project-Management GmbH.</p>
	<p>The project has attracted investors in both Germany and China, reports Christoph Lang of Berlin's Trade and Industry Promotion Office. "Chinese investors have already asked if we have a Chinatown here," he says. "The cultural environment is very important for them. You cannot build a synthetic Chinatown."</p>
	<p>Germany is home to about 72&#160;000 Chinese migrants (2002 Federal Statistical Office figures), but the country has not had a Chinatown since the early 1930s in Hamburg, when most of the city's 2&#160;000 Chinese residents fled or were arrested by the Nazis.</p>
	<p>German's more-recent history with anti-foreigner extremism remains a problem even within the government, reports Deutsche Welle (DW), Germany's international broadcaster. DW notes that National Democratic Party lawmaker Holger Apfel's xenophobic (comments about "state-subsidized oriental mega-families" at first went largely uncriticized.</p>
	<p>"Every fourth German harbors anti-foreigner sentiments," DW quotes Miriam Gruss, a Free Democratic Party parliamentarian. "Right wing extremism is clearly rooted in the middle of society. It's not a minor phenomenon." The German government initiated a special Youth for Democracy and Tolerance program in January 2007 as part of its tolerance-building efforts.</p>
	<p>While it is not clear how many Chinese migrants will ultimately settle in the new German Chinatown, developers hope the project will increase Germans' understanding for China and Chinese culture.</p>
