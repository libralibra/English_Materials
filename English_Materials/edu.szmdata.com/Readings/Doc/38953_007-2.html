	<p>In a society where all aspects of our lives are dictated by scientific advances in technology, science is the essence of our existence. Without the vast advances made by chemists, physicists, biologists, geologists, and other diligent scientists, our standards of living would decline, our flourishing, wealthy nation might come to an economic depression, and our people would suffer from diseases that could not be cured as a society we ignorantly take advantage of the amenities provided by science, yet our lives would be altered interminably without them.</p>
	<p>Health care, one of the aspects of our society that separates us from our archaic ancestors, is founded exclusively on scientific discoveries, and advances. Without the vaccines created by doctors, diseases such as polio, measles, hepatitis, and the flu would pose a threat to our citizens, for although some of these diseases may not be deadly, their side effects can be a vast detriment to an individual affected with the disease.</p>
	<p>In addition, science has developed perhaps the most awe-inspiring, vital invention in the history of the world, the computer. Without the presence of this machine, our world could exist, but the conveniences brought into life by the computer are unparalleled.</p>
	<p>Despite the greatness of present-day innovators and scientists and their revelations, it is requisite to examine the amenities of science that our culture so blatantly disregards, for instance, the light bulb, electricity, the telephone, running water, and the automobile are present-day staples of our society, however, they were not present until scientists discovered them.</p>
	<p>Because of the contribution of scientists, our world is ever metamorphosing, and this metamorphosis economically and personally comprise our society, whether our society is cognizant of this or not.</p>
