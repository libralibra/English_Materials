	<p class="stems">86. This passage is mainly concerned with ____.</p>
		<ol type="A">
			<li key="1"><span>the spread of the bird flu virus to mammals</span></li>
			<li>the domestic and wild poultry population</li>
			<li>H5N1 isolated only from chicken</li>
			<li>a new virus strain jumping routinely from person to person</li>
		</ol>

	<p class="stems">87. The fact that the H5N1 virus was isolated from apparently healthy ducks suggests that ____.</p>
		<ol type="A">
			<li>researchers worked really hard</li>
			<li>ducks were inoculated with H5N1 vaccine</li>
			<li key="1"><span>ducks might be a natural host of the virus</span></li>
			<li>the virus made animals sicker than other viruses</li>
		</ol>

	<p class="stems">88. We can infer from Paragraph 3 that ____.</p>
		<ol type="A">
			<li>the year in which the virus was isolated has nothing to do with the severity of illness</li>
			<li>ducks are more likely to contract avian flu</li>
			<li key="1"><span>accumulated mutations have occurred in the H5N1 virus</span></li>
			<li>mice that are immune to the virus become sick</li>
		</ol>

	<p class="stems">89. The findings show that the accumulated mutations ____.</p>
		<ol type="A">
			<li>have been adept at infecting mammals</li>
			<li key="1"><span>may have contributed to the increased virulence of the virus</span></li>
			<li>have led to the virus's DNA changes</li>
			<li>require genetic analysis of the same samples</li>
		</ol>

	<p class="stems">90. Koopman is convinced that human beings must learn to live with bird flu because ____.</p>
		<ol type="A">
			<li>study findings highlight the need for improved surveillance</li>
			<li>wild animals are easy to cull</li>
			<li>the disease could come back at any time</li>
			<li key="1"><span>it is impossible to eliminate any natural host of the virus</span></li>
		</ol>
