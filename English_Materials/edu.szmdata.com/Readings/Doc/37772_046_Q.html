	<p class="stems">76. The primary purpose of the passage is to ____.</p>
		<ol type="A">
			<li>discuss a plan for investigation of a phenomenon that is not yet fully understood</li>
			<li>present two explanations of a phenomenon and reconcile the differences between them</li>
			<li>summarize two theories and suggest a third theory that overcomes the problems encountered in the first two</li>
			<li key="1"><span>describe an alternative hypothesis and provide evidence and arguments that support it</span></li>
		</ol>

	<p class="stems">77. According to Snyder <i>et al</i>., caffeine differs from adenosine in that caffeine ____.</p>
		<ol type="A">
			<li>stimulates behavior in the mouse and in humans, whereas adenosine stimulates behavior in humans only</li>
			<li>has mixed effects in the brain, whereas adenosine has only a stimulatory effect</li>
			<li>increases cyclic AMP concentrations in target neurons, whereas adenosine decreases such concentrations</li>
			<li key="1"><span>permits release of neurotransmitters when it is bound to adenosine receptors, whereas adenosine inhibits such release</span></li>
		</ol>

	<p class="stems">78. In response to experimental results concerning IBMX, Snyder <i>et al</i>. contended that it is not uncommon for psychoactive drugs to have ____.</p>
		<ol type="A">
			<li key="1"><span>mixed effects in the brain</span></li>
			<li>inhibitory effects on enzymes in the brain</li>
			<li>close structural relationships with caffeine</li>
			<li>depressive effects on mouse locomotion</li>
		</ol>

	<p class="stems">79. According to Snyder <i>et al</i>., all of the following compounds can bind to specific receptors in the brain EXCEPT ____.</p>
		<ol type="A">
			<li key="1"><span>phosphodiesterase</span></li>
			<li>caffeine</li>
			<li>adenosine</li>
			<li>theophylline</li>
		</ol>

	<p class="stems">80. Snyder <i>et al</i>. suggest that caffeine's ability to bind to A<sub>i</sub> and A<sub>2</sub> receptors can be at least partially attributed to which of the following?</p>
		<ol type="A">
			<li>The chemical relationship between caffeine and phosphodiesterase.</li>
			<li key="1"><span>The structural relationship between caffeine and adenosine.</span></li>
			<li>The structural similarity between caffeine and neurotransmitters.</li>
			<li>The ability of caffeine to stimulate behavior.</li>
		</ol>
