			<p>A baby was undergoing microsurgery last night to save an arm, after his baby carriage was crushed by a tractor.</p>
			<p>Twenty-two-month-old Ryan Millard of Dalton, Texas, was rushed 100 miles to Las Vegas's Cummington Medical Center after the accident near his home. The operation involved a specialist team of surgeons who have sewn back arms on two patients at the hospital in the past five weeks.</p>
			<p>It took more than ten hours for five surgeons, working through the night, to sew back Ryan Millard's left arm.</p>
			<p>The 22-month-old baby woke up only minutes after the operation, doctors said. Now his parents wait to see if the incredibly complex and difficult operation has been a complete success.</p>
			<p>After Ryan's arm had been broken into two parts, they were packed in ice for the journey to Cummington. Ice keeps a broken limb usable for valuable hours longer so that surgeons have a chance to sew it back.</p>
			<p>Now Ryan has gone through all this, what are his chances of making a complete recovery? About 60-40 percent, the doctors said.</p>
			<p>Hospital secretary, Mr. David Astley, said yesterday, "The operation was technically successful, but it will be some months before we know whether the baby will have 100 percent use of his arm."</p>
			<p>Ryan's mother, Mrs. Glynis Millard, said, "We are so grateful to the doctors who have performed this miracle."</p>
