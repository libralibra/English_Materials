				<tr><td class="roles">W:</td><td>Good morning, everybody in front of the TV. Now, we are glad to have invited Dr. Brian Schmitt from Department of Psychology, University of Washington, to tell us something about psychological health in a general sense. I am giving the microphone to Dr. Smith.</td></tr>
				<tr><td class="roles">M:</td><td>Hi, everyone. It's my pleasure to be here to talk about the issue. In a study of older people with sisters and brothers, psychologist Debra Gold of the Duke Center for the study of aging and human development found that about 20% of the interviewed said they were hostile or indifferent toward their sisters and brothers. Reasons for this ranged from inheritance disputes to hostility between spouses. But many of those who had poor relationships admitted that they felt guilty. Although most people admitted to some lingering rivalry, it was rarely strong enough to end the relationship. Only four out of the 54 people interviewed had completely broken up with their sisters and brothers and only one of the four felt comfortable with the break. As sisters and brothers advanced into old age, closeness increases and rivalry diminishes, explains Victor Cicirelli, a psychologist at Purdue University. Most of the elderly people he interviewed said they had supportive and friendly dealings and got along well or very well with their sisters and brothers. Only 4% got along poorly. Gold found that as people age, they often become more involved with and interested in their sisters and brothers. 53% of those she interviewed said that contact with their sisters and brothers increased innate adulthood. With family and career obligations reduced, many said that they had more time for each other. Others said that they felt it was time to heal wounds. A man who had recently reconciled with his brother told Gold there is something that lets older people put aside bad deeds of the past and focus a little on what we need now, especially when it's sisters and brothers.</td></tr>
