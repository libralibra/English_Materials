			<p>The breasts are a profound source of females' self-image. Cancer of the breast may seriously affect a woman's perception of her identity and breast loss can be very psychologically damaging. Therefore, most breast cancer centers employ counselors. The role of the counselors is to help people adjust to the physical and psychological blow of breast cancer. About 30% of women with the disease suffer from prolonged anxiety and depression, which are natural responses to the loss of a breast or fear of the disease. Women who failed to adjust often have other life crisis such as divorce or unemployment. These psychological problems can be helped by referral to a psychiatrist. He may recommend psycho-therapy or medication to aid recovery. Physical and sexual rehabilitation can be helped by providing the woman with an adequate prosthetic device and by encouraging the woman and her partner to discuss sexual problems in an open way. The decision to use a prosthetics or to undergo breast reconstruction usually is based on the woman's own body image. Other key factors include her level of physical activity, style of clothing, her willingness to reveal the diagnosis of breast cancer to others. The majority of women can return to normal employment after any type of breast cancer surgery. In addition, most are able to enjoy all types of physical recreation, including swimming and golf.</p>
