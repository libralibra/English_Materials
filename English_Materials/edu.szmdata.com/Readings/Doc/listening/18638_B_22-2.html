Oh, thanks a million. What next? How long will I go on now? Will I be able to live any kind of normal life? Tell me!</td></tr>
				<tr><td class="roles">W:</td><td>I prescribed for you on the basis of the symptoms you yourself described to me. Only a colonoscopy can reveal your condition. No doctor could diagnose your condition without the hospital tests that I arranged for you. And yes, you will be able to live a pretty normal life and go work, and everything. Nobody need ever know a thing unless you choose to tell them. And you have full life ahead of you.</td></tr>
