			<p>"Most people think when they are depressed, it just means you feel sad '', says Doctor R, a psychiatrist with Cornell University Medical College. In fact, the so-call commonest symptoms of depression are probably the most painful for a lot of people which are a feeling that you are useless, worthless, unlovable, and no good or loser. A commonest symptom and a most extreme symptom, of course, is a suicidal feeling where you feel so hopeless that you don't believe anything will get better and you are better off. C therapy challenges that kind of thinking. For example, say, you are a depressed teen, someone at school says something credible, typically that might lead you to think you are a completely loser. F says C therapy help patients see all the time they have been successful, both at school and with friends. It is completely the opposite of how you feel. So you challenge them with reality. And then you correct their dysfunctional release and that will actually change the way they feel, F says. It's a sort of personal reality check that will connect experience in context. Once the combination of medication and therapy work, patient may decide to stop taking anti-depressants. But they should do so with caution because they may experience side effect. They can get rebound kind of symptoms. It can grow things like feeling anxious, or having insomnia, very dizzy and having nausea.</p>
