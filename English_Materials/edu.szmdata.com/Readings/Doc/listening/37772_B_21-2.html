			<p>Hi, everybody. I know that many of you here must have heard about multiple sclerosis, a terrible disease. But I am going to tell you a story how a patient with this disease fought it. Her name was Janet James. Janet was 22 years old when she was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis -- a disease that attacks the body's nerves. She had just graduated from college and got a job at an advertising agency when she began to sense that something strange was going on inside her body. When Janet realized how severe her illness was, she knew she had better hurry up and live life. Multiple sclerosis is the biggest crippler of young adults in the United States. And although she didn't have many symptoms, Janet knew that it was just a matter of time. First on her agenda was to pursue her dream of hosting a pop music programme. She worked at a radio station for a year, always aware that her body was degenerating. Then her best friend moved away. And one night Janet began screaming, "I got to go! I got to go!" Two weeks later, she arrived at Alaska, thousands of miles from her friends, her family and her past. "Everything fell into a place", she recalls. A 23-year-old girl with an incurable disease can fly to Alaska and everything can work out. The multiple sclerosis attacks came and went. Most of the time they hardly slowed her down. Janet hiked, fished, learnt to sail and experimented with hot air ballooning. "I lived for adventure", she says. "Nobody ever had a better time or did more exotic strange things than I did in an 80-year period." Inevitably, however, the day came when she was so weakened that she had to return to Pittsburgh, her hometown. There she began reliving her adventures by writing a book about them. Her book was published in 1993.</p>
