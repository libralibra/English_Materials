			<p>Many teachers believe that the responsibility for learning lies with the student. If a long assignment is given, instructors expect students to be familiar with the information in the reading, even if they do not discuss in class or give an examination. The ideal student is considered to be one who is motivated to learn for the sake of learning, not the one interested only in getting high grades. When research is assigned, the professor expects the students to take the initiative and complete the assignment with minimal guidance. It is the student's responsibility to find books, periodicals and articles in the library. Professors do not have the time to explain how a university library works. They expect the students, particularly graduate students, to be able to exhaust the reference sources in the library. Professors will help the students who need it but prefer that their students not be overly dependent on them. In the United States, professors have other duties besides teaching. Often they are responsible for administrative work within their departments. In addition, they may be obliged to publish articles and books. Therefore the time that a professor can spend with a student outside of class is limited. If a student has problems with classroom work, he should either approach a professor during office hours or make an appointment.</p>
