			<p>Jill Kinmont was an avid skier, competing and winning numerous titles in junior and senior national skiing events. As Jill says, "Skiing was it -- everything -- my world." Jill's world collapsed on Jan 30th 1955 when she skied off the Alta run and landed helplessly on the slope. Her fourth, fifth, and sixth cervical vertebrae were broken. For days, Jill hovered between life and death. By April, it became clear that she would be paralyzed from the shoulders down. Jill underwent rehabilitation therapy with cheerful determination. She learned to write, to type, and to feed herself. Once she had mastered daily living skills, she enrolled at the University of California at Los Angeles, where she studied art, German, and English. After overcoming yet came another personal tragedy, the death of her boyfriend in a plane crash. Jill graduated in 1961. By this time, Jill had chosen a new career goal: teaching elementary school children. Officials at UCLA, however, rejected her application for admission to the graduate school of education because of her paralysis. But she persevered, working with children in the UCLA Clinic School. When her family moved to Seattle, Jill was able to fulfill her new dream. She attended the School of Education at the University of Washington and began her new life's work as a teacher. She taught school first in Washington, then Beverly Hills in California. Finally moving back to Bishop in 1975 where she taught special education in Bishop Union Elementary School until her retirement in 1996.</p>
