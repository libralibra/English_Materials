			<p>In 1977, a dead author of detective stories saved the life of a 19-month-old baby in a most unusual way. The author was Agatha Christie, a gentle married lady and one of the most successful writers of detective stories in the world.</p>
			<p>In June 1977, a baby girl became seriously ill in Qatar, near Saudi Arabia. Doctors were unable to diagnose the cause of her illness with confidence, so she was flown to London and admitted to Hammersmith Hospital, where specialist help was available. She was then only semi-conscious and on the "Dangerously 111" list. A team of doctors hurried to examine the baby only to discover that they, too, were baffled by the very unusual symptoms. While they were discussing the baby's case, a nurse asked to speak to them.</p>
			<p>"Excuse me," said Nurse Marsha Maitland, "but I think the baby is suffering from thallium poisoning."</p>
			<p>"What makes you think that?" Dr. Brown asked. "Thallium poisoning is extremely rare."</p>
			<p>"A few days ago, I was reading a novel called <i>A Pale Horse</i> by Agatha Christie," Nurse Maitland explained. "In the book, somebody uses thallium poison, and all the symptoms are described. They're exactly the same as the baby's."</p>
			<p>"You're very observant and you may be right," another doctor said. "We'll carry out some tests and find out whether it's thallium or not."</p>
			<p>The tests showed that the baby had indeed been poisoned by thallium, a rare metallic substance used in making optical glass. Once they knew the cause of the illness, the doctors were able to give the baby the correct treatment. She soon recovered and was sent back to Qatar. Enquiries revealed that the poison might have come from an insecticide used in Qatar.</p>
