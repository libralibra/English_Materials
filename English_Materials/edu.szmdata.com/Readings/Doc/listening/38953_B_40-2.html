			<p>Recent studies of patients at sleep clinics have revealed significant facts about the causes of insomnia as well as ways to deal with it. It is no surprise that stress and depression are linked to insomnia. Also insomnia may be caused by physical illness. Itching, aches, asthma, arthritis, ulcer and heart problems that involves shortness of breath or difficulty in breathing.</p>
			<p>What can you do if you suffer from insomnia? Two things. You can eat certain foods that will help you fall asleep and stay in sleep. And you can do certain things that are sleep-inducing. Here are some guidelines.</p>
<ol type="A">
	<li>If you had a bad night sleep, don't stay in bed later the next morning.</li>
	<li>Don't go to bed earlier the next night. Stick to your usual bedtime and rising pattern.</li>
	<li>Don't nap during the day. Naps cut down on night sleep time.</li>
	<li>Never lie awake in bed for more than 30 minutes. By lying in bed sleepless you can form an association between your bed and sleepless.</li>
	<li>Get as much as exercise as possible, preferably in the morning.</li>
</ol>
			<p>As for foods intake to help you sleep, make sure that your diet is a balanced one and rich in tryptophan and amino acid found in certain food. The body can convert tryptophan to l-tryptophan and then to ceretonine, a body chemical crucial to the sleep process. If you include in your daily diet food high in tryptophan, such as apples, eggs, cheese, fish and meat, and incorporate some of the sleep-inducing activities into your life, the chances are good that you will achieve a pattern of restful, soothing sleep.</p>
