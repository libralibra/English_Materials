				<tr><td class="roles">W:</td><td>Every year millions of us fall victim to the common cold. As the symptoms include coughing and sneezing, it is widely assumed that colds are spread through the air to be inhaled by other sufferers. But research has shown that cold viruses can survive for a limited time on a number of surfaces, including human skin. So they can also he passed on through physical contact. The only efficient way to avoid spreading or catching a cold is to isolate yourself completely, though this is hardly practical. Colds are rarely serious as antibodies are quickly produced to counter the effects of the cold -- producing virus, which may be any one of hundreds. Commercially produced cold cures are many and provide an important source of income for pharmaceutical companies. They would no doubt regret the loss of the common cold. There are also numerous folk remedies, some more bizarre than others. I prefer to try and drown the cold bugs in alcohol. It may do little for the cold but it certainly cheers me up.</td></tr>
