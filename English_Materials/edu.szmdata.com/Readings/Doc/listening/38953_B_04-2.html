				<tr><td class="roles">M:</td><td>Yeah, well, I'm not saying she's unfair. It's just that it seems, no matter what I do in my assignments, she docks me marks with no real explanation.</td></tr>
				<tr><td class="roles">W:</td><td>I had that problem once. In the first paper, I ended up with a "B". I thought it was a pretty good paper so I went to see her about it. And I was surprised how open and frank she was. She clearly told me her standards and expectations.</td></tr>
				<tr><td class="roles">M:</td><td>But shouldn't she have been doing this in class, long before she even gave out assignments?</td></tr>
				<tr><td class="roles">W:</td><td>She tends to be deliberately vague to force you to seek out her expectations. She wants you to be creative first and then think of your boundaries.</td></tr>
				<tr><td class="roles">M:</td><td>I See. She must be getting students knocking on her door for answers every time an assignment is handed back.</td></tr>
