			<p>Now that you've completed your eye exam, let's talk about different options for your glasses. Since you said you are interested in wearing contact lenses, let me give you some information about them.</p>
			<p>There are several advantages to contact lenses. The contact lenses correct vision more effectively than eyeglasses. Since they move with your eye, you always see through the lens's optical center. The result is crisp images, excellent depth perception, and natural peripheral vision. Contact lenses also have cosmetic benefits. They never steam up or get rain-splattered, and they never slip down your nose.</p>
			<p>On the other hand, contact lenses are costly. You'll probably spend a few hundred dollars a year on the chemical cleaning system alone. Disposable contacts cost even more. There are two types of conventional contact lens: soft lenses and rigid gas-permeable lenses. Soft lenses cost about $175 to $275 for the original fitting. Rigid gas-permeable lenses cost about $25 more. The cost for disposable contacts is between $450 to $600 for a year's supply. And unfortunately, there is some degree of eye infections and eye diseases with contacts.</p>
			<p>I hope I haven't confused you too much. I just want you to be aware of both the disadvantages and advantages of contact lenses. And remember, if you choose contacts and then decide they are too much trouble, going back to glasses is always an option. Eyeglass wearers outnumber contact lens wearers by four or five to one. Why don't you think about it and let me know in a few days.</p>
