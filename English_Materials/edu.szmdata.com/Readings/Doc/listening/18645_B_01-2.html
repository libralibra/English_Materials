				<tr><td class="roles">M:</td><td>A throat infection? That's pity. Is there something I can do to help?</td></tr>
				<tr><td class="roles">W:</td><td>In fact, he has class this afternoon from 1:30 to 3:00, and he won't make it. He doesn't want to cancel the class completely though.</td></tr>
				<tr><td class="roles">M:</td><td>Is he looking for a substitute?</td></tr>
				<tr><td class="roles">W:</td><td>No, that actually wouldn't be necessary. What he wants me to do is find someone to go in and play a ninety-minute wildlife videotape about native North American rodents. It should only take a few minutes to set up.</td></tr>
				<tr><td class="roles">M:</td><td>1:30 you say? Well, I will be on campus around that time. Perhaps I could just take care of it for him. In fact, I might just stay and watch the show. I enjoy watching footage of bears and raccoons. Where was his class again?</td></tr>
				<tr><td class="roles">W:</td><td>Nasitir Hall, Room 110. Should I bring the key? I could drop it off.</td></tr>
				<tr><td class="roles">M:</td><td>No, thanks, we have master keys for all of the offices so I can drop-in and try to find the materials without too much hassle.</td></tr>
				<tr><td class="roles">W:</td><td>Thanks a lot, Professor.</td></tr>
				<tr><td class="roles">M:</td><td>My pleasure.</td></tr>
				<tr><td class="roles">W:</td><td>Oh, and there is a question sheet on his desk that he was hoping to pass out to the students before the tape started. Do you think you could do that as well?</td></tr>
				<tr><td class="roles">M:</td><td>Certainly, and please be sure to tell Jim to take it easy.</td></tr>
