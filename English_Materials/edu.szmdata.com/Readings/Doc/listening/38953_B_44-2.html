			<p>Although there are an extensive supplier of vitamins, minerals and high quality proteins, eggs also contain a high level of blood cholesterol, one of the major causes of heart disease. One egg yolk in fact contains a little more than two-thirds of the cholesterol the body needs daily. This knowledge has caused egg sales to drop in recent years, which in turn has brought about the development of several alternatives to eating regular eggs.</p>
			<p>One alternative is to eat substitute eggs. These egg substitutes are not really eggs. They look somewhat like eggs when they are cooked. They have the advantage of having a lower cholesterol rate and they can be scrambled or used in baking. One disadvantage, however, is that they are not good for hying or boiling A second alternative to regular eggs is a new type of eggs, sometimes called "designer eggs". These eggs are produced by hens that are fed low fat diet, including such ingredients as corn, flask and rice bran. In spite of their diet, however, these hens produce eggs that contain the same amount of cholesterol as regular eggs. Yet, the producers of these eggs claim that eating their eggs will not raise the blood cholesterol in humans.</p>
