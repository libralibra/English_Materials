			<p>There are two kinds of people in the world. And I am the one of them. I am the kind of person who likes to be on time for things. In fact, I like to be early. Let's say I need to catch a flight that is leaving at 4 p.m. Usually I am at the gate, ticket out, ready to go, no later than 07:14 a.m. My wife is the other kind of person. For her, the ideal way to catch a plane would be to arrive at the airport as the plane was taking off. Part of this is a cultural difference. I grew up in a WASP, that is white Anglo-Saxon Protestant household, and my wife grew up in a Cuban household. WASPS tend to follow schedules strictly. Cubans tend to be more relaxed. If a WASP wedding is scheduled to start at 2 p.m. Saturday, the wedding march will start at 2 p.m. sharp. And the bride will come down the aisle at 2:03 p.m. No matter what, even if the original scheduled groom has bailed out and the bride has to use an emergency back-up groom taken right off the street. Whereas in a typical Cuban wedding, the phrase "2 p.m." is translated as "Possibly this weekend".</p>
			<p>But the difference between my wife and me is not totally cultural. I think it is also gender-related. I believe that men and women do not view time in the same way. I think that in general women think that there is more time in the universe than men do.</p>
