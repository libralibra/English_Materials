			<p>No one should be forced to wear a uniform under any circumstances. Uniforms are demeaning to the human spirit and totally unnecessary in a democratic society. Uniforms tell the world that the person who wears one has no value as an individual but only lives to function as a part of a whole. The individual in a uniform loses all self-worth.</p>
			<p>There are those who say that wearing a uniform gives a person a sense of identification with a larger, more important concept. What could be more important than the individual himself? If an organization is so weak that it must rely on cloth and buttons to inspire its members, that organization has no right to continue to exist. Others say that wearing of uniforms, eliminates all envy and competition in the matter of dress, such that a poor person who cannot afford good-quality clothing need not be looked down upon belittled by a wealthy person who wears expensive, quality clothing. Those persons conveniently ignore such critical concepts as freedom of choice, motivation and individuality. If all persons were to wear the same clothing, why would anyone strive to be better? It is like forcing everyone to drive the same car, have the same type of house, eat the same types of foods. When this happens, all incentive to improve one's life is removed. Why would parents bother to work hard so that their children could have a better life than they had when they know that their children are going to be forced to have exactly the same life that they had?</p>
			<p>Uniforms also hurt the economy. Right now, billions of dollars are spent on the fashion industry yearly. Thousands of persons are employed in designing, creating, and marketing different types of clothing. If everyone were forced to wear uniforms, artistic personnel would be unnecessary. Salespersons would be superfluous as well; why bother to sell the only items that are available? The wearing of uniforms would destroy the fashion industry which in turn would have a ripple effect on such industries as advertising and promotion. Without advertising, newspapers, magazines, and television would not be able to remain in business. The entire information and entertainment industries would collapse.</p>
