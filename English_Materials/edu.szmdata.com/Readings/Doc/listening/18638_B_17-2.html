			<p>Here's a dreamy weight-loss plan: take a nap. That's the message from work by Sanjay Patel at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio. His study of more than 68&#160;000 women has found that those who sleep less than 5 hours a night gain more weight over time than those who sleep 7 hours a night.</p>
			<p>Controlling for other differences between the groups, Patel found that women who slept 5 hours or less gained 0.7 kilograms more on average over 10 years than 7-hour sleepers. The short-sleeping group was also 32 percent more likely to have gained 15 kilograms or more, and 15 percent more likely to have become obese.</p>
			<p>Significantly, the short-sleepers consumed fewer calories than those who slept 7 hours, says Patel, who presented his results this week at the American Thoracic Society International Conference in San Diego, California. This finding overturns the common view that overeating among the sleep-deprived explains such weight differences.</p>
			<p>Lower metabolic rate resulting from less sleep may be the reason behind the weight gain, Patel suggests. "It obviously also suggests that getting people to sleep more might be a relatively easy way to help people lose weight," he says.</p>
