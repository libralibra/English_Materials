			<p>Women may be more susceptible to the lung damaging effects of smoking than men, according to new research by Inga-Cecilie Soerheim, M. D., and her colleagues from Channing Laboratory, Brigham and Women's Hospital and University of Bergen, Norway. They analyzed data from a Norwegian case-control study including 954 subjects with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/copd" target="_blank">COPD</a>) and 955 controls. All were current- or ex-smokers, and the COPD subjects had moderate or severe COPD.</p>
			<p>"Overall our analysis indicated that women may be more vulnerable to the effects of smoking, which is something previously suspected but not proven," said Dr. Soerheim.</p>
			<p>The study results will be presented on May 18 at the 105th International Conference of the American Thoracic Society in San Diego.</p>
			<p>Examining the total study sample, there were no gender differences with respect to lung function (<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/fev1-copd" target="_blank">FEV1</a>) and COPD severity, but the women were on average younger and had smoked significantly less than men.</p>
			<p>To explore these differences further, they also analyzed two subgroups of the study sample: COPD subjects under the age of 60 (early onset group) and COPD subjects with less than 20 pack-year of smoking (low exposure group). In both subgroups, women had more severe disease and greater impairment of lung function than men.</p>
			<p>"This means that female smokers in our study experienced reduced lung function at a lower level of smoking exposure and at an earlier age than men," said Dr. Soerheim.</p>
			<p>It has long been suspected that the effect of smoking on lung function may be modified by gender. Interaction analysis confirmed that being female represents a higher risk of reduced lung function and severe COPD, but this gender effect was most pronounced when the level of smoking exposure was low.</p>
			<p>"The gender difference in COPD susceptibility seems to be most important when smoking exposure is low. Women may tolerate small amounts of tobacco worse than men," Dr. Soerheim explained.</p>
			<p>According to Dr. Soerheim, the reason why women may be more susceptible to the effects of cigarette smoke is still unknown, but there are several possible explanations: "Women have smaller airways; therefore each cigarette may do more harm. Also, there are gender differences in the metabolism of cigarette smoke. Genes and hormones could also be important."</p>
