			<p>Life insurance isn't fun to buy. It forces you to think about your death, a subject many prefer not to confront. But there is a single over-riding reason to buy life insurance: to provide an income for your dependents if you die. Don't depend solely on an agent to figure out your life insurance needs. Rule-of-thumb estimates, such as five or eight times your income, are guesses. They may produce too little or too much insurance. Carry too little insurance and you may not provide a reasonable standard of living after your death. Carry too much and you may not enjoy a reasonable standard of living while you are alive. According to statistics, most people who have life insurance don't have enough. Then, how do you determine the amount of life insurance you will need to maintain your current family life style if the breadwinner dies. First, figure what your family's expense would be if you die tomorrow. Then analyze your assets and the source of income that you can use to cover the expenses. Finally, subtract the assets from the needs. The result is the amount of additional insurance you will need to buy.</p>
