I'm afraid that the scan results aren't very good. It's likely that you got a recurrence of cancer in you pancreas. That would explain why you've been feeling so tired, and your loss of appetite and weight.</td></tr>
				<tr><td class="roles">M:</td><td>Doctor Smith, do I need surgery?</td></tr>
				<tr><td class="roles">W:</td><td>Surgery isn't an option at this stage. Although we cannot operate, there's still a lot we can do to help you. You've got tablets for pain relief, and we can give you something stronger if you need it. We can also start you on a course of chemotherapy to help you with your symptoms. This won't cure you, but will make you feel more comfortable. It's unusual to have any unpleasant side effects with this kind of chemotherapy. I like you to see a dietician for some advice on what you eat and to help you get your appetite back.</td></tr>
				<tr><td class="roles">M:</td><td>What's my life expectancy? How long have I got?</td></tr>
				<tr><td class="roles">W:</td><td>One can never be certain about these issues. People with this condition vary a great deal. I would be wrong to give you a definite time scale. But I'd say it's a matter of months rather than years. I'm sorry to have to tell you all this, but my feeling is that it's always good to be honest with people, then you know what's what. If you are in agreement, I'd like to book you into Ward 2 to start your chemo. You'll need to come in every week for the next month.</td></tr>
