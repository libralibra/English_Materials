			<p>Millions of American baby boomers who received polio shots in the 1950s and 1960s could now be at risk of getting cancer. That is a shocking finding of a medical investigation into the vaccine that was given to schoolchildren 40 years ago to fight the polio plague that was sweeping the nation. Experts now say that some of the injections were contaminated by a virus from monkeys known as SV40 which may cause a rare form of cancer in humans. Batches of the vaccine were somehow contaminated by the virus between 1955 and 1963, and accidentally given to young children in 37 states. Moreover, some doctors believe the virus may have already mutated and could now be transmitted through human contact, ultimately causing an epidemic similar to AIDS. The terrifying finding was published in a prestigious cancer research journal which reported that a startling new rise in some types of cancer such as brain tumors could be linked to the tainted vaccines. It pointed to SV40 as a possible reason for a 30% increase in brain tumors in the United States over the past 20 years. "At first, it was just a finding of one more virus, just another thing we had to screen for. But then we started to develop tumors in Hemsters." said Dr. Morris Hallyman. Doctors were shocked by the discovery, which is being investigated in heavily populated areas.</p>
