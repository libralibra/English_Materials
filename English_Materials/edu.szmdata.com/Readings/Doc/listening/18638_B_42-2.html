			<p>You might think that the most dangerous type of eating disorder that women face involves overeating, but according to medical records, that is not the case. The majority of women who die as a result of eating problems suffer from starving themselves, commonly referred to as anorexia. While most overeaters are able to carry themselves around and function somewhat normally, although not optimally, anorexic victims have a different experience.</p>
			<p>They are harmed due to the scarce amounts of intake. Their bodies can barely function and hence, insufficient food quite often causes fainting spells that can occur at inappropriate moments -- at meetings, in the mall, or while walking around. This becomes especially dangerous when their failure to remain alert occurs while driving or operating machinery. Obviously, an eating disorder of this kind is as disturbing as overeating and could put the individual in great danger.</p>
			<p>Most anorexics suffer from a poor body image, whose primary cause is society's demand on women to be overly thin. Since not much research has been done on anorexia, this illness is difficult to spot, and it is estimated that over 100 women die each year from the disease in the United States alone. Although anorexia ranges in age, the majority are teenagers to women in their mid-twenties.</p>
			<p>Can we do anything about those suffering from anorexia? Hospitalization has been proven effective, and specialists suggest intensive counseling for these women to bring down their injuries and fatalities.</p>
