				<tr><td class="roles">W:</td><td>When you lift your leg, that nerve should slide in and out of your spine quite freely. But with your leg, the nerve won't slide very far. When you lift it, the nerve gets trapped and it is very sore. When I bend your knee, that takes the tension off and eases the pain. If we straighten it, the nerve goes tight, and it's painful.</td></tr>
				<tr><td class="roles">M:</td><td>Ahi.</td></tr>
				<tr><td class="roles">W:</td><td>Now what's trapping the nerve? Well, your MRI Scan confirms that you've got a damaged disc in the lower part of your back.</td></tr>
				<tr><td class="roles">M:</td><td>Oh. I see.</td></tr>
				<tr><td class="roles">W:</td><td>The disc is a little pad of gristle, which lies between the bone and your spine. Now if you lift heavy loads in the wrong way, you can damage it. And that's what happened to you. You've damaged a disc. It's pressing on a nerve on your spine so that it can't slide freely. And that's the cause of this pain you have been having.</td></tr>
				<tr><td class="roles">M:</td><td>Aha.</td></tr>
				<tr><td class="roles">W:</td><td>Now we are going to try to solve the problem first of all with bed-rest to let the disk to get back to normal, and with drugs to take away the pain and help the disc to recover. We will also give you some physiotherapy to ease your leg and back. I can't promise that this would be entirely successful. And we may have to consider an operation at a later date.</td></tr>
