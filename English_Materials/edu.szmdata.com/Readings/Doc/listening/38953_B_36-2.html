			<p>It is estimated that almost 55% of American adults and approximately 10% of kids are overweight. But how does one tell the difference between baby fat and weight that poses a health risk? In June 2000, the Department of Health and Human Services unveiled a new tool that would help answer that question.</p>
			<p>It revised the familiar Children's Growth Chart used since 1977, to track height and weight, and introduced Body Mass Index (BMI) chart for children between the ages of 2 and 20. The body mass index, or BMI, is a number derived from a person's height and weight measurement. It has long been used to determine if adults are overweight. The new BMI chart is considered the best tool for assessing whether children are the right size and can identify a child's likelihood of unhealthy weight gain as early as age 2. Armed with a child's BMI, a parent or doctor can use the new chart to see where a child measures up compared with his or her peers. BMI changes with age for kids. A 9-year-old girl with a BMI of 23 would be near the 97th percentile and overweight. A 16-year-old with the same measure would be in the 75th percentile and considered normal because at the 95th percentile or above, the child is identified as overweight. The new chart comes as nutrition experts and doctors focus more on childhood obesity, a reflection of the changing nature of modern-day life. In 1969, obesity in children was not even an issue. Parents worried about their child's weight hear the same advice that many adults don't heed: Eat a low-fat diet, rich in fruit and vegetables and get regular exercise. But at least the new charts will help parents begin the process of changing behaviour at an early age.</p>
