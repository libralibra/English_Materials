			<p>Today, our series on "Chemicals in the Household" will focus on lead poisoning. The term "lead poisoning" refers to the inhalation or consumption of lead or lead products into the body even in a minute amount. We are more vulnerable to the harmful effects of chemicals than one would imagine. Lead was used in the paint on walls and other products commonly found in the house. As a result, many people grew up inhaling the chemical and thereby, damaging their health.</p>
			<p>Advances in chemistry in these past three decades have dramatically decreased the use of lead in paint. In this way, lead poisoning does not pose the same threat that it did several decades ago. However, the problem still remains acute for families who live in decrepit buildings that have not been repainted since the discovery of the chemical's toxicity. Daily inhalation of lead leads to its accumulation in the body. This amount can be considerable, especially for young children whose bodies are smaller and immune systems weaker.</p>
			<p>The most effective way to combat lead poisoning is to educate the public of its harmful effects. For tomorrow's program, we will continue our discussion on lead poisoning by discussing how to detect and treat it.</p>
