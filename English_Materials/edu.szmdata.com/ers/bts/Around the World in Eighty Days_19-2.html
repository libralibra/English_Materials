	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER NINETEEN</p>

	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">Passepartout Takes a Too Great Interest in His Master</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">H</span>ong Kong is an island. It has been possessed by the English since 1842, and the English have made it into an important city.</p>

	<p>Passepartout wandered towards the Victoria port. The city seemed very much like Bombay, Calcutta, and Singapore. At the port he found ships from all nations: English, French, American, Dutch, Chinese, and Japanese.</p>

	<p>On reaching the docks, he was not surprised to see Fix walking up and down. The detective seemed very disturbed and disappointed, and he had good reason. The warrant had not yet come, and Phineas Fogg would soon leave British land.</p>

	<p>"This is bad," said Passepartout quietly, "for the gentlemen of the Reform Club!" He gave Fix a big smile and said, "Well, Monsieur Fix, have you decided to go with us to America?"</p>

	<p>"Yes," replied Fix.</p>

	<p>"Good!" said Passepartout, laughing. "I knew you would not leave us. Let's get our rooms."</p>

	<p>They entered the office and paid for their rooms. The clerk told them that the repairs had been finished, and the Carnatic would be leaving that evening.</p>

	<p>"That will suit my master all the better," said Passepartout. "I will go and let him know."</p>

	<p>Fix decided to tell Passepartout everything. It seemed to be the only way to keep his master in Hong Kong. He invited Passepartout into a bar. When they entered they saw a large bed at the end of the room. At the small tables many people were drinking English beer, gin, and brandy. While they drank they smoked opium from long pipes. From time to time one of the smokers, affected by the drug, would slip under the table. Then the waiters would carry him to the bed. The bed already had twenty of these people.</p>

	<p>Fix and Passepartout saw that they were in a smoking-house filled with the customers of the English opium merchants. The Chinese government tried to stop this evil with strong laws, but failed.</p>

	<p>They ordered two bottles of wine. They chatted about the journey. When the bottles were empty, Passepartout rose to go and tell his master about the change in the time.</p>

	<p>Fix caught him by the arm, and said, "I want to have a serious talk with you."</p>

	<p>"We'll talk about it tomorrow. I haven't time now," Passepartout said.</p>

	<p>"Stay! It's about your master."</p>

	<p>Passepartout looked at his companion, and sat down.</p>

	<p>Fix lowered his voice, and said, "You have guessed who I am?"</p>

	<p>"Of course!" said Passepartout, smiling.</p>

	<p>"Then I'm going to tell you everything&#151;"</p>

	<p>"Now that I know everything! Those gentlemen have put themselves to useless expense.</p>

	<p>"Useless!" said Fix. "It's clear you don't know how large the sum is."</p>

	<p>"Of course I do. Twenty thousand pounds."</p>

	<p>"Fifty-five thousand!" answered Fix.</p>

	<p>"What!" cried the Frenchman. "There's all the more reason to not delay!"</p>

	<p>"If I succeed, I get two thousand pounds. If you'll help me, I'll let you have five hundred of them."</p>

	<p>"Help you?" cried Passepartout.</p>

	<p>"Yes; help me keep Mr Fogg here for two or three days."</p>

	<p>"What are you saying? Those gentlemen followed my master, and now they want to stop him!"</p>

	<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

	<p>"I mean this is a shameful trick. And gentlemen, too. Bah!"</p>

	<p>Fix began to be puzzled.</p>

	<p>"Members of the Reform Club!" continued Passepartout. "You must know, Monsieur Fix, that my master is an honest man."</p>

	<p>"But who do you think I am?" asked Fix.</p>

	<p>"An agent of the members of the Reform Club!"</p>

	<p>The detective thought for a moment. "Well," said the detective to himself, "as he is not a partner, he will help me."</p>

	<p>"Listen to me," said Fix abruptly. "I am not an agent of the members of the Reform Club. I am a police detective, sent out here by the London office. I will prove it. Here are my papers. Mr Fogg's wager is only for show. On the 28th of last September fifty-five thousand pounds were stolen from the Bank of England. The description of the robber matches Mr Phineas Fogg exactly."</p>

	<p>"My master is the most honorable of men!"</p>

	<p>"How do you know? You know nothing about him. He left London with a foolish reason, without trunks, and with a large amount of money. Would you like to be arrested as his partner?"</p>

	<p>Passepartout did not look at the detective. Phineas Fogg, who rescued Aouda, a robber! He did not want to believe that his master was guilty.</p>

	<p>"Well, what do you want of me?" said Passepartout.</p>

	<p>"I have tracked Mr Fogg here, but I have failed to receive the warrant. You must help me keep him here in Hong Kong."</p>

	<p>"Never!" replied Passepartout. "Mr Fix, even if my master is really the robber you are seeking&#151;which I deny, I have been in his service. I have seen his goodness, and I will never betray him&#151;not for all the gold in the world."</p>

	<p>"You refuse?"</p>

	<p>"I refuse."</p>

	<p>"Then think I have said nothing," said Fix, "and let us drink."</p>

	<p>"Yes, let us drink!"</p>

	<p>Passepartout began to feel the alcohol. Fix gave him more, and he put an opium pipe in Passepartout's hand. He took it and drew several puffs. His head became heavy, and it fell onto the table.</p>

	<p>"At last!" said Fix. "Mr Fogg will not know about the Caryatid's time. If he finds out, he will have to go without this horrible Frenchman!"</p>
