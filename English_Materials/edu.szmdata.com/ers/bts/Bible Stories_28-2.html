	<p class="storyTitle">28. A Tent for Worship</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">D</span>uring the long years that Moses and his people had been on the road, they had stopped occasionally to build an altar to give special thanks to God. But they had no building or set place in which to worship. God told Moses that it was time for the Israelites to build a tent to serve as a place of worship. They would call it a tabernacle. It would be easy to take apart and put back together so they could take it with them on their journey.</p>

	<p>God described exactly how the tent was to be built and what would go inside it. Many materials were needed to create the "tent. When the people found out what Moses wanted them to build, they gladly donated the wood and cloth and precious metals that the Egyptians had given them. The inside would have beautiful curtains. Behind one set of curtains would be a special chest of gold and wood called the mercy seat.</p>

	<p>Aaron was to be the leader of the worship services. He and his sons would have special clothes to show they were priests. They would make offerings on the altar to show the people's love and obedience for the Lord.</p>
