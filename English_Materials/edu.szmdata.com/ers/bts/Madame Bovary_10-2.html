	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER ONE</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">Y</span>onville was a quiet, small town, twenty-four miles from Rouen. Until 1835, there was no proper road to Yonville. The town had a church, a small market, a one-room town hall, and a single narrow street, with a few shops on either side. Nothing had changed in Yonville for many years till the Bovarys came.</p>

	<p>As the Bovarys entered the center of the town, some townspeople appeared in the market square. They all started talking at once, asking for news and explanations. They had been delayed by Madame Bovary's dog, which had run across the fields. They spent some time looking for it. But finally, they had to come. Emma had begun to cry and grew angry. She said it was Charles' fault.</p>
