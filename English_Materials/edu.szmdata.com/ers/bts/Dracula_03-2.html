	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER THREE</p>

	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">Jonathan Harker's Journal Continued</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">T</span>he sudden realization that I was being held against my will made me a little crazy for a moment. Soon, however, I calmed down and tried to think what to do. I decided not to say anything to the Count. I feared for my life. It was clear to me now that Dracula had no servants. That meant he was the driver of my carriage and that he had some special power over the wolves. This evening, I will do my best to keep my knowledge a secret.</p>

	<p>12 May&#151;It's been several days since I last wrote. In this time, I've learned how excellent a businessman Count Dracula is. I will now document a conversation that we had because I feel it may help me in the future.</p>

	<p>One evening, the Count expressed to me that he might wish to have more than one agent, like myself, working for him in other parts of Europe. He asked me if this was possible.</p>

	<p>"Of course. Many people do that," I answered.</p>

	<p>"Wonderful. Now, here are some paper and envelopes for you to use to write to whomever you like. I do ask, however, that you specifically write to your boss and inform him that you will be staying here for a month."</p>

	<p>My heart felt pain when he spoke these words, for I had no choice. Count Dracula was a customer and I must do as he wished. I politely took the writing materials from him and sat down to work on two letters. The Count did the same. I wrote to my dear Mina and to my boss, Mr Hawkins. When I finished, I gave the letters to the Count with the envelopes sealed. I was careful not to write anything personal, for I knew the Count could easily read what I had written.</p>

	<p>"I apologize. Tonight, I will be very busy," said the Count, "I trust that you will be fine without me. By the way, I recommend that you don't fall asleep anywhere in this old home other than your room. It could be quite dangerous." He then quickly left me.</p>

	<p>Later that evening, I went to my bedroom and sat down next to the window, for it was now my habit to stay up until the early morning. Such sleeping habits are beginning to make me very nervous. Often, I imagine I can see and hear all kinds of terrible things.</p>

	<p>In order to calm myself a little, I enjoyed the view of the countryside in the moonlight from my room window. Moments later, I saw something moving down outside and down below me. I leaned farther out of the window and looked along the castle wall. Suddenly, a white face appeared outside a window just under my room. It was the Count! At first, I thought he was enjoying the view like myself. However, he then pulled his body out of the window and began to move downward along the castle walls like a spider. I could not believe my eyes! My fear has never been greater. I am in terrible danger!</p>

	<p>15 May&#151;Last night, I watched again as the Count exited the castle from his bedroom window. Feeling a little safer now to wander, I went around and tried every door I could find. Sadly, they were all locked, except for one that led to an old room in the southwest corner of the castle. It looked like it hadn't been used in many years. From its windows, I could see that the castle was built high upon a mountain. Three of the castle's sides looked down into empty space, for they sat upon the mountain's edge. I guessed that the castle was built this way for protection against the many enemies that threatened the people of Hungary for so many centuries before. Looking back toward the room, I felt terribly alone. And yet, there were something charming and comfortable about it. These words were written at a little desk in that very room.</p>

	<p>16 May (morning)&#151;I fear I'm losing my mind. Only writing in this journal seems to keep me feeling calm. I fell asleep in that room I just wrote about, remembering very clearly the words of the Count, suggesting I never sleep anywhere but in my own room. I was tired of the room in which so much of my time here has been spent, so I decided to risk it and lay my head down. I do not know whether I actually slept or not. I remember closing my eyes and then opening them to find three pretty women standing in the middle of the room. Their lips were deep red like the Count's, and their teeth were bright and sharp. I am embarrassed to admit, but, very suddenly, I wanted them to press their red lips against mine.</p>

	<p>The woman with the lightest skin said to one of the others, "Look how handsome he is. You can kiss him first."</p>

	<p>As one of the women approached me, I lay helpless on the couch, as if in a dream. The woman was extraordinarily beautiful. And her breath, when she put her face near mine, smelled both sweet and bloody. Her eyes were almost red and she smiled in a way that made me feel uncomfortable. Slowly, she moved her face away from mine and down toward my neck. I felt the heat of her breath as she moved her mouth closer and closer. My skin felt the pressure of two points as her teeth were about to sink into my throat.</p>

	<p>Then I saw a large white hand grab the woman bending over me. She was violently pulled back and thrown like a doll across the room. The Count now stood before me with his face full of terrible anger.</p>

	<p>"I told you not to go near him! He is for me! When I no longer need him, you can do whatever you like with him. Here," the Count said, throwing a large bag on the ground, "This is for you."</p>

	<p>The three women immediately ran and tore open the bag. Just then, I thought I could hear the sound of a small child beginning to cry, but it was interrupted as the women picked up the bag and carried it quickly out of the room. I don't remember anything after that. My fear was so great that I must have lost consciousness.</p>
