	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER TWENTY-NINE</p>

	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">The Pain of Weakness</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">M</span>arquis de la Mole had never been angrier. He screamed at Julien.</p>

	<p>"I am not perfect," Julien said. "You have been very good to me. The only people that understood me were you and this delightful person."</p>

	<p>"Delightful?" the marquis shouted. "When you found her delightful you should have left!"</p>

	<p>"I tried. I asked you to let me go to Languedoc." Julien answered.</p>

	<p>"You should have fled. It was your duty."</p>

	<p>Julien quickly wrote a short letter.</p>

	<blockquote class="letter">

	<p>My life is unbearable. I want to kill myself. I'm sorry for bringing trouble to the marquis.</p>

	</blockquote>

	<p>"Take this letter and kill me, or have your servant do it," Julien said.</p>

	<p>"Go to hell!" screamed the marquis.</p>

	<p>Who can I talk to? Julien thought. Count Altamira? Can he stay silent forever? Father Pirard won't help me; he is too much of a Jansenist. Wait, I'll confess to him. Then he'll advise me.</p>

	<p>Father Pirard was not completely surprised. "I suspected this love. The marquis will probably try to send you to America."</p>

	<p>Mathilde was very worried. Her father had shown her Julien's suicide note. "If he dies, I will die too. Maybe you'll be happy. But first I'll be his widow in public. I won't be afraid."</p>

	<p>When Julien returned Mathilde met him outside. "You must flee!" she said. "Stay with Father Pirard. I'll handle everything here. You must trust me."</p>

	<p>Father Pirard told the marquis that Mathilde and Julien must be married. "Anything else would be a crime before God," he said.</p>

	<p>Marquis de la Mole saw this wisdom, but it made him angry. He was ambitious. He wanted his daughter to have a noble husband. I never thought this could happen, he thought. This century is crazy!</p>
