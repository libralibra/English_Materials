	<p class="storyTitle">65. Jesus Is Alive</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">J</span>esus died on Friday, the day before the sabbath. The soldiers wanted to bury Jesus' body quickly, so they could take up the crosses before the sabbath. They went around to the bodies of Jesus and the other two men, making sure they were dead.</p>

	<p>Sometimes the soldiers broke the prisoners' legs to see if they were still alive, but they left Jesus' legs alone.</p>

	<p>Joseph, one of Jesus' followers, heard about Jesus' death and went to see Pilate. He wanted to donate a tomb he owned, so Jesus could have a proper burial. Pilate agreed Joseph could take Jesus' body.</p>

	<p>So Joseph and Nicodemus, another of Jesus' followers, took Jesus to the tomb and wrapped his body in linen cloth. They sprinkled his body with spices as the Jewish laws said, but they did not have all the oils they needed. Mary and some other women who had come with them said they would bring the oils back after the sabbath.</p>

	<p>Then the two men rolled a huge stone in front of the tomb to seal it off. As she watched these things, Mary was very sad.</p>

	<p>Two guards were assigned to guard the tomb. Early on Sunday morning, they felt the ground rumble, and watched as the stone in front of the tomb rolled away. They fainted because they were so scared.</p>

	<p>Shortly after that, Mary and a friend of Jesus' named Mary Magadalene came to the tomb bringing oils and spices for Jesus' body. They were shocked to see that the rock had moved. The women rushed inside to see what had happened to Jesus' body.</p>

	<p>An angel greeted them as they walked inside. The women were very frightened and fell to their knees.</p>

	<p>"You have come looking for Jesus of Nazareth," the angel said. "He is not here. He has risen from death."</p>

	<p>The women looked at the place where Jesus' body had been. It was empty.</p>

	<p>"Go back and tell Jesus' disciples the wonderful news," the angel said. "Tell them Jesus will meet them in Galilee."</p>
