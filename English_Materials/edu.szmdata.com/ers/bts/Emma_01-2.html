	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER ONE</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">T</span>his story takes place in the late 1700's, in a small town in England called Highbury. The main character is a charming, intelligent, and rich young woman named Emma Woodhouse. She is a confident girl of twenty-one years old, and is the younger of two daughters. Although Emma's older sister, Isabella, married Mr John Knightley, and moved away many years ago, Emma has declared that she will never marry. She and her father live alone at Hartfield manor. Her father is quite content with her decision not to marry because he hates change of any kind, and is happy to continue living with his youngest daughter for the rest of his life. Mr Woodhouse believes Emma is the most intelligent and gentle young woman in the world.</p>

	<p>Emma's mother died when Emma was five years old. Since that time, Emma and her sister had been cared for by a nanny, someone to watch over and care for them. Their nanny's name was Miss Taylor, who loved Emma and Isabella as a mother would. Eight years later, Isabella married and moved to London, sixteen miles away from Hartfield. Throughout the next seven years, Miss Taylor became Emma's best friend, and the two women spent every day together. Mr Woodhouse and Miss Taylor gave Emma all she desired, and always agreed with Emma. Therefore, Emma, as well, believed her opinions to be correct and fair.</p>

	<p>When Emma was twenty-one years old, Miss Taylor married Mr Weston, a man of fifty years old, living in Highbury. Emma was a bit upset after Miss Taylor got married because Miss Taylor was her best friend, who she spent every day with. After Miss Taylor married, she moved to Mr Weston's home, so Emma had only her father to talk to and dine with everyday. Mr Woodhouse was upset, as well, because he hated any changes in his life, and loved Miss Taylor almost as a daughter.</p>

	<p>Emma loved her father very much, but Miss Taylor was her best friend, and throughout her life, Miss Taylor was the person she would talk to most. Every evening, after finishing dinner, Emma's father would go to sleep, and Emma would then sit alone, thinking about how much she missed Miss Taylor. October and November were especially lonely for Emma because her sister would not come to Hartfield until Christmas with her husband and children.</p>

	<p>Emma smiled and laughed with her father, so he would not be upset that Miss Taylor had moved away, but Mr Woodhouse believed Miss Taylor was unhappy with her decision because it was a change in her life, and Mr Woodhouse believed everyone shared his beliefs.</p>

	<p>"Poor Miss Taylor! I wish she were here again. What a pity it is that Mr Weston thought to marry her!"</p>

	<p>"I cannot agree with you, papa; you know I cannot. Mr Weston is such a happy and pleasant man; he deserves a good wife."</p>

	<p>The night after Miss Taylor left the Woodhouse home, Emma and her father were unhappy about Miss Taylor's leaving. The two decided to play a game, but Mr George Knightley, the older brother of Isabella's husband, came to visit. George Knightley lived a mile away, at Donwell manor, and often came to visit the Woodhouse home. He knew Mr Woodhouse and his daughter would be upset about Miss Taylor's leaving, so he came to entertain them.</p>

	<p>Mr Knightley thought Emma was intelligent and caring, as everyone who knew Emma did, but he knew Emma had faults, which no one else believed. He told Emma his opinions, although he often disagreed with her, while most others agreed with her completely.</p>

	<p>"Mr Knightley loves to find fault with me, you know&#151;in a joke&#151;it is all a joke," Emma told her father that night.</p>

	<p>"Emma knows I never flatter her," said Mr Knightley.</p>

	<p>Although Emma is upset that Miss Taylor has moved away, she is content with herself because she introduced Miss Taylor to her new husband, Mr Weston, four years before. Emma believes that she is responsible for the happiness between Miss Taylor and Mr Weston because the two met through Emma. Mr Knightley disagrees with Emma; he believes Emma is not responsible for the marriage because it was luck, not Emma, who decided the match. Though Emma and Mr Knightley disagree on who is responsible for the marriage, Mr Woodhouse dislikes any further match-making. As Mr Woodhouse hates any changes in his life, he wants Emma to stop finding husbands and wives for her friends.</p>

	<p>"But, my dear, pray do not make any more matches; they are silly things, and break up families."</p>

	<p>"Only one more, papa, only for Mr Elton."</p>

	<p>Mr Elton had lived in Highbury for over a year, but was still unmarried at the age of twenty-six or seven. He was charming, handsome, and respected in Highbury, but still hadn't found a wife.</p>

	<p>Mr Knightley agrees with Mr Woodhouse's dislike for Emma's match-making, "Leave him to choose his own wife."</p>
