	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN</p>

	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">First Experience of Life</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">W</span>e will not give many details about this time in Julien's life. We have them, of course, but we don't want to make the story so sad. Julien did not make friends with his fellow students. He would not be happy even if he did. The students only cared about stupid things, like food, and they did bad things all the time.</p>

	<p>Julien knew now that difference brings hatred. He tried to make friends with a faithful student. But soon the student refused him. "It's every man for himself! God might strike you down and I don't want to be near you!" he said.</p>

	<p>When the students did not talk about food, they talked about the life of a working priest. One day they were talking about the way the pope chooses people for different positions. Julien decided to use his knowledge of the pope. He astonished them, but it was another failure. His ability became a new crime against him.</p>

	<p>His failure was the same as Father Ch&#x00E9;lan's failure. They both thought it best to talk honestly, but if people do not like you, this is a crime.</p>

	<p>The other students gave him a new nickname: Martin Luther.</p>
