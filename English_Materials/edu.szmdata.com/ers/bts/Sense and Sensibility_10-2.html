	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER TEN</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">W</span>illoughby came to the cottage the next morning to see Marianne. Mrs Dashwood was more than polite to him, showing kindness, elegance, and charm.</p>

	<p>Miss Elinor Dashwood had a pretty figure and a regular face. Marianne was still handsomer. She was not as tall as her sister, but many called her beautiful, with a lovely smile and attractive figure. Marianne was delighted with the handsome Willoughby. He was a perfect gentleman, and when Marianne heard him declare that music and dancing were two of his favorite activities, she was thoroughly impressed with this young man.</p>

	<p>It was only necessary to mention any of Marianne's favorite activities for her to begin talking. She could not be silent when discussing art and music. The two soon discovered that they both greatly enjoyed dancing and music. They then began discussing books, and realized they shared the same favorite books. Their likes were quite similar. The same books, the same quotes were remembered by both. They were soon speaking to each other as if they were old friends.</p>

	<p>"Well, Marianne," said Elinor, as soon as he had left them, "you have spoken of all your favorite subjects in one morning with your new friend. What will you discuss during his next visit, as you have spoken of almost all you know."</p>

	<p>"Elinor," cried Marianne, "is this fair? But I see what you mean. You think I should have been dull, and spoken only of the weather and simple matters, just as a polite young woman should. If I had spoken this way, then you would not disturb me as you do now."</p>

	<p>"My love," said her mother, "you must not be angry with Elinor. She was only joking."</p>

	<p>Willoughby seemed to enjoy his visit to the Dashwood home, and returned every day after. At first, he claimed that he was coming to ask about Marianne's hurt foot, but after some time, he came just to see the family, as he realized they were delighted to see him, as well.</p>

	<p>His visits became Marianne's main enjoyment of the day. They read, they talked, they sang together. He was a talented musician, as she was herself.</p>

	<p>Mrs Dashwood believed him to be a perfect gentleman, and Elinor observed that he was very much like her sister&#151;passionate about all his interests, saying too much what he thought on every occasion, without attention to the situation. He quickly gave his opinions of other people, although such opinions were perhaps not polite in the situation. Elinor saw these qualities in her sister, as well.</p>

	<p>Elinor now noticed Colonel Brandon's interest in her sister with great concern. At first, when Mrs Jennings had announced Colonel Brandon to be in love with Marianne, Elinor did not entirely believe the old woman. Now, however, she saw that Colonel Brandon was greatly in love with her sister. She pitied the poor man, as his rival for Marianne's love was a lively, talkative young man of twenty-five, whereas Colonel Brandon himself was a shy, rather silent man of thirty-five. Elinor truly respected Colonel Brandon, although he was rather serious and quiet, and she sincerely hoped that Colonel Brandon's interest in her sister would soon end, as she saw he could never be successful against the young Willoughby. Marianne and Willoughby did not view Colonel Brandon in the same way. They rather disliked him for his being older, with quiet, serious manners.</p>

	<p>"Colonel Brandon is the kind of man," said Willoughby one day, "that everyone likes, and nobody cares about; whom all are delighted to see, and nobody remembers to talk to."</p>

	<p>"That is exactly what I think of him," cried Marianne.</p>

	<p>"Colonel Brandon is a sensible man," said Elinor. "Yes, although he is a man between thirty and forty, but he has seen a great deal of the world, and has considerable knowledge on many subjects."</p>
