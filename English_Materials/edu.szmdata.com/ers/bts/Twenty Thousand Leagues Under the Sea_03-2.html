	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER THREE</p>

	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">My Decision</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">T</span>hree seconds before the arrival of this letter, I had no plans to pursue this mysterious sea monster myself. Three seconds after reading the letter, however, I decided it was my duty to find this animal, so the seas would again be safe for travel.</p>

	<p>I had just returned from quite a tiring journey, and wished to again see my country, my friends, and my little house. However, after receiving the letter, I forgot my tiring journey, my friends, my little house&#151;and accepted this invitation from the American Government.</p>

	<p>"Besides," thought I, "all roads lead back to Europe, and the sea animal may be friendly enough to hurry me towards the coast of France. Perhaps the animal will be caught in the seas of Europe."</p>

	<p>"Conseil," I called to my servant, in an impatient voice.</p>

	<p>Conseil was my faithful servant, who traveled with me on all my visits. I liked him, and I believe he liked me. He was calm, quick, eager to assist me, and only gave his advice when it was asked for. He had come with me on all my travels for the past ten years, and never once complained. At thirty years old, he was always in excellent health. He was ten years younger than his master, but seemed a great deal more energetic and youthful than I. But Conseil had one fault, he was always too formal, even after ten years of service, he spoke to me only as a servant.</p>

	<p>"Conseil," I said again, beginning to prepare for the departure.</p>

	<p>As he was quite a faithful servant, I never asked him if my traveling would be convenient for him, but this trip would be rather long, and perhaps dangerous. What would Conseil say?</p>

	<p>"Conseil," I called a third time.</p>

	<p>"Did you call, sir?" he asked as he entered.</p>

	<p>"Yes, please prepare for us to leave in two hours."</p>

	<p>"Of course," replied Conseil, quietly.</p>

	<p>"We must hurry," I said quickly.</p>

	<p>"We are returning to France, then?" he asked.</p>

	<p>"Oh, certainly, but we are not returning directly," I answered shortly. "We will be taken aboard the Abraham Lincoln. We will help destroy that dangerous whale that has destroyed so many ships on the seas." We then packed our things and left to board the great ship.</p>

	<p>"Professor Pierre Aronnax?" the captain of the ship greeted me as we arrived.</p>

	<p>"Yes," I replied, "Captain Farragut?"</p>

	<p>"You are welcome, Professor, your room is ready for you."</p>

	<p>The Abraham Lincoln was an excellent choice for the journey, as it reached a speed of nearly twenty miles an hour, a rather high speed for a ship, but would never be able to win a battle with the mysterious sea animal. As I was settling into my room, the captain called for us to depart from the port. If I had arrived fifteen minutes later than I had, I would have missed this amazing journey.</p>

	<p>Captain Farragut decided we would not return to the area in the Pacific Ocean where the sea monster was last seen. As we left the harbor, a crowd of nearly five hundred thousand people cheered as they watched our departure.</p>
