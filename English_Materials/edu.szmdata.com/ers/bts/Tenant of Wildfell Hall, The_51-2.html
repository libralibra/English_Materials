	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">An Unexpected Incident</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">O</span>ne cold day during December, I was walking home when I saw Eliza Millward walking towards my home. We walked along together, although I said little to her, as I was still quite upset with her behaviour towards my dear Helen.</p>

	<p>"I was just coming to see your sister, Mr Markham," she said. After a pause, she continued, "I have some news for your sister," she said with a smile, "Do you know why Mr Lawrence has left?"</p>

	<p>"Is he gone?" I asked, quite surprised.</p>

	<p>"His sister is going to be married next Thursday."</p>

	<p>"No, Eliza, that's not true!"</p>

	<p>"Mr Markham, are you alright? You look ill."</p>

	<p>I immediately left her, to go see Mr Lawrence. He had, indeed, left for Grassdale! At that moment, I decided I must leave for Grassdale. She must not marry anyone but myself. I quickly explained to my mother that I must leave to do business. The journey was long, and I thought of nothing but my dear Helen. The driver informed me that the wedding was taking place at the Grove, the home of the Hargraves. As I arrived, however, I saw the bride and groom step out of the house, married. I walked closer. But wait, the groom was Mr Lawrence! And the bride&#151;a lovely beauty, indeed.</p>

	<p>"Is that you, Markham?" he asked, looking confused.</p>

	<p>"Yes, Lawrence&#151;is that you?"</p>

	<p>"Please meet my new wife. Esther, this is Mr Markham. Markham, this is Mrs Lawrence," he said with a smile, "Did you receive my letter?"</p>

	<p>"What letter?"</p>

	<p>"The one announcing my wedding."</p>

	<p>He soon informed me that Helen was with her aunt at Staningley. I quickly departed, leaving for Staningley.</p>
