	<p class="storyTitle">18. Joseph's Plan</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">T</span>he king was very upset by what Joseph had told him. He did not want the people of Egypt to starve during the seven years of famine.</p>

	<p>"If the king will do these things," said Joseph, "then the people can be saved."</p>

	<p>Pharaoh listened closely to what Joseph told him.</p>

	<p>"You must first find a wise man to be in charge of the crops during the seven good years. He can see that plenty of food is stored away. Then when the bad times come, he can see that the people get plenty to eat."</p>

	<p>"No one could be better for that job than you," the king said to Joseph. "After all, you are the one God chose to bring us this message."</p>

	<p>Joseph went to work for Pharaoh. He spent the first seven years travelling around the countryside in his chariot, making sure the grain was harvested and put away in the King's storehouses. The next seven years brought a great famine as Joseph had said. The people of Egypt cried out to their king for help.</p>

	<p>'"Go see Joseph," the king told them. "And do whatever he tells you."</p>

	<p>Jacob, Joseph's father, heard of the great stores of grain in Egypt. He sent Joseph's brothers to buy some of it for their family. They made the long journey from Canaan to Egypt. When they got there, they were told that the governor of the city was in charge of the grain. So they came to the governor, Joseph.</p>

	<p>"We have come from Canaan to buy food for our families," they said.</p>

	<p>"No, you have come only as spies to see how bad things are in Egypt," Joseph said.</p>

	<p>"That is not true!" they said. "We are brothers. There were twelve of us, but one is gone and the other is with our father."</p>

	<p>Benjamin was not with the brothers, so Joseph knew he was the one left behind. He told the others he would keep them prisoners and send one of them back to fetch the youngest brother.</p>

	<p>"That will prove to me that you aren't spies," he said.</p>

	<p>The brothers stayed in prison for three days. Joseph came to speak with them again. This time he had another plan.</p>

	<p>"Let one of your brothers stay here," he said. "The rest of you carry corn back to your home. But if you want to be safe, bring the youngest brother back to me so I'll know you are really telling the truth."</p>

	<p>They began to talk to each other in their native language, Hebrew thinking that Joseph would not be able to understand them.</p>

	<p>"It is a terrible thing that we did to our brother Joseph. Now we are being punished for it." they said.</p>

	<p>Reuben said to them, "Didn't I tell you that we should not hurt the boy? You didn't listen to me and now we must pay for what we've done to him."</p>

	<p>Joseph turned his back and wept when he heard what his brothers said about him. Then he sent all but his brother Simeon back to Canaan.</p>
