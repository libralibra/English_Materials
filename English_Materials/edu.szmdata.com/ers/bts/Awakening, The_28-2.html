	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">E</span>dna's dinner turned out to be quite small, ten people in total. She had invited twelve, however, Ad&#232;le was feeling ill and Madame Lebrun could not come for some reason. However, her son Victor was there, as well as Mr Ratignolle. Among the other guests were Arobin, of course, Ms Reisz, Mr and Mrs Highcamp, and two other couples that were fairly close to Edna.</p>

	<p>The dinner went very well. Edna used only her best plates and bowls. Everyone talked about how wonderful the food was. The guests were in an excellent mood. They talked and laughed throughout the evening. Edna, too, was quite happy, until that feeling of sadness suddenly came over her again. She could not understand why it hit her so suddenly and on such a happy occasion. She felt a feeling of hopelessness. And then, to make things worse, Victor, who was a little drunk with wine, began, at the request of one of the guests, to sing. Edna immediately realized that it was the song that Robert used to sing at Grand Isle and shouted for Victor to stop. He, however, thought she was joking and continued. "Stop singing that! Stop! I don't want to hear that!" She shouted again, this time, putting her glass of wine down forcefully on the table and knocking over the bottle. The wine spilled all over the table and on Arobin's trousers.</p>

	<p>Victor then stopped and politely kissed Edna's hand as he apologized for upsetting her. The kisses awakened a desire in her.</p>

	<p>The guests then decided that it was time to go. Victor asked Arobin if he was going to go home in the same direction as himself. Arobin said that he was not. And then everyone, except for Arobin was gone.</p>

	<p>He helped Edna to check that all of the doors and windows were closed and locked. Edna had let all the servants go except for Celestine. When they finished, the house was then closed and together they walked to Edna's new home.</p>

	<p>It was not far away, only a block from her husband's. She had already decorated the home. It was quite a comfortable little place. When they entered the house, Edna was surprised to find flowers everywhere. Arobin had had them delivered and secretly arranged for Celestine to put them around the house before Edna arrived.</p>

	<p>Edna was not sure what to think of all of this. She took a seat for a moment.</p>

	<p>"You must be sleepy," commented Arobin. "Why don't you go to bed? I'll leave."</p>

	<p>"Yes, good idea. I've been feeling so much pressure lately," she said leaning forward and resting her arms and head on the table before her.</p>

	<p>Arobin began to gently move his hand along her hair.</p>

	<p>"I thought that you said you were going?" Edna said, a little bothered, but at the same time enjoying the feeling of his touch.</p>

	<p>"Oh, yes. I just want to say goodbye first." He then began to kiss her body. "You need to take it easy for a few days. You've been doing too much lately."</p>

	<p>"Yes, goodnight, then. Bye," Edna said weakly.</p>

	<p>He did not stop kissing her. She did not resist.</p>
