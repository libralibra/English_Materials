	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER NINETEEN</p>

	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">The Execution</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">T</span>he Musketeers all stepped back, and the man wearing the red cloak stood alone in the center of the room.</p>

	<p>"Please forgive me!" cried Milady, falling down on her knees.</p>

	<p>The man said nothing and waited for silence.</p>

	<p>"That woman," he began, "was once a lovely young girl; she was as beautiful as she is now. She joined a convent and became a nun. The head of the convent was a young man, and he fell in love with her. Eventually, she persuaded him to marry her and to travel far away together. But they needed money to escape to another part of France. She stole many things from the church, and the man sold them. But then, just before they left, they were arrested."</p>

	<p>"They were taken to prison and within a week the prison official's son had fallen in love with her. She was punished with ten years in prison, but he helped her to escape. The head of the convent was also punished with ten years, and to be marked. At that time I was the executioner of the city of Lille, as this woman has already said. It was my job to mark the man and I did&#151;and that man was my only brother!"</p>

	<p>"I promised myself that the woman should at least share his punishment because she had stolen and destroyed him. I learned where she was hidden, so I went to find her. I caught her and placed the same mark on her shoulder that I had to give to my brother.</p>

	<p>"When I returned to Lille, I learned that my brother had just escaped from prison. The people of the town thought I had helped him escape and they put me in prison until he was caught. My brother, of course, did not know this. He had followed this woman. They went together to the town of Berry, and he found a job. They told everyone that this woman was his sister.</p>

	<p>"A short time later, the official of that area fell in love with her and asked to marry her. She left my brother to marry the official and became the Countess de la Fere. My brother's heart was broken and he could not live in the same area as her. He decided to come back to Lille. When he learned that I was put in prison for him, he came and took my place willingly. I was set free and my brother was put in prison. A few nights later he killed himself. That is the story of this woman's crime and why she was given the mark of death."</p>

	<p>"Mister d'Artagnan," Athos said seriously. "What punishment do you think should be given to this woman?"</p>

	<p>"The punishment of execution," answered d'Artagnan.</p>

	<p>"Mister Aramis and Mister Porthos," Athos continued. "You are judges here, what punishment do you believe is fair?"</p>

	<p>"The punishment of execution," answered the Musketeers.</p>

	<p>Milady screamed and moved forward on her knees towards her judges. She tried to speak but no sound came out of her mouth. The executioner grasped her arm and pulled her out of the house.</p>

	<p>The executioner brought her to the boat on the river. He then tied her hands together. She turned to the men and cried out.</p>

	<p>"You are all murderers! Nine men to kill one woman!"</p>

	<p>"A woman? You are not a woman!" Athos said coldly. "You are a terrible devil escaped from hell&#151;and we are now sending you back."</p>

	<p>"You do not have the power of life and death! You are not judges!" screamed Milady, "You cannot kill me!"</p>

	<p>"You are not a judge and you killed Constance Bonacieux," said d'Artagnan.</p>

	<p>Milady yelled in fear and fell down on her knees. The executioner began to prepare the boat.</p>

	<p>"Oh, God!" she screamed. "Are you going to throw me in the river?"</p>

	<p>"Executioner, do your job," said Athos.</p>

	<p>"Yes, sir. Willingly," answered the executioner, "for I believe that, in the eyes of God, I am doing right."</p>

	<p>The boat began to move slowly across the river. The Musketeers watched the boat cross to the other side. The sky was red and the executioner and Milady looked like black shadows.</p>

	<p>In this time, Milady was able to untie the rope around her hands and feet. When they reached the other side she jumped away from the boat and began to run. The rain had made the ground wet and she fell down in the mud.</p>

	<p>The Musketeers on the other side of the river saw the executioner slowly raise his arms. His sword was bright with moonlight. His two arms came down with great speed and power and Milady gave out one last little cry&#160;...&#160;</p>
