	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER THIRTEEN</p>

	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">A Confession</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">I</span> began to look for you. I knew that you lived in a place called Geneva, because I had listened to the geography lessons that Felix taught Safie. I knew which way I had to travel to find the city.</p>

	<p>You understand, Frankenstein, that at this time my heart was filled with hate. You gave me a body, a mind, and feelings. Then you left me alone in the world to be feared and hated by everyone, and I know that you hate me the most of all. I truly believed you were evil, and I still think God will punish you for the terrible thing you have done to me.</p>

	<p>I traveled in the dark so no one would see me. It was winter, and often snow fell. But I almost never stopped to rest. I thought of nothing but finding you. When I reached the edge of Switzerland, it was springtime. I decided to enjoy the warm, sunny days and travel during the daytime. But I would make sure to travel through the forest, so no one would see me. However, one day I reached a river. Suddenly I heard voices near me. I hid behind a tree and watched a little girl run by me. She was laughing, and I thought she was playing a game with someone behind her. Suddenly, she fell into the river.</p>

	<p>The strength of the flowing water quickly pulled her away from the edge. I knew I had to save her, or she would die. I jumped in and swam to her. I carried the unconscious girl to shore, and she was just waking up, when her father grabbed her from me and ran away. I started to follow them, trying to talk to him. But suddenly he pointed a gun at me and shot! I fell to the ground, crying out in pain.</p>

	<p>I had saved the child's life, and this was my reward! Now, I hated the world even more. I had to spend the next few weeks in the forest, resting and healing myself. Finally, I was able to continue traveling.</p>

	<p>Two months later, I reached the forest outside of the city of Geneva. I was tired and hungry, and had just sat down under a tree. I was thinking about how I would find you, and what I would say to you. Suddenly a little boy came running towards me. For a moment, I felt some hope. Here was a child, who probably was not afraid of ugly people, like adults were. Maybe he could be my friend. As the boy ran past me I reached out and grabbed him. He covered his face with his hands and screamed. I did not want him to scream, because others might hear him. I said gently, "I'm not going to hurt you."</p>

	<p>"A monster!" he screamed. "Let me go! My father is an important man, and if you hurt me he'll find you and hurt you, too! His name is Alphonse Frankenstein&#160;...&#160;"</p>

	<p>"Frankenstein?" I screamed. "You come from the family of my enemy. Now, I will have my revenge. I will kill you to punish HIM." The child continued to fight and scream terrible things at me. I grabbed his throat and squeezed it. In a moment he was dead, his neck broken. I realized that I had killed an innocent person, and I fell to the ground in horror. I cried as I looked at the little child on the ground. But I knew that this would make you feel great pain, and in a moment, I was glad that I had killed him! As I stared at the dead boy, I saw a necklace around his neck. I picked it up and went closer to the city of Geneva. Soon, I came to a barn. I saw a young woman sleeping there. I wanted to wake her up, but I knew she would only scream. Later, she might remember me, and learn that I was the boy's killer. Even though I did not know what she would do, I decided to make her suffer anyway. I put the necklace in the pocket of her dress. Of course, I knew that when it was found, everyone would believe that she was the killer.</p>

	<p>When I had done this, I waited until the boy's body was found. Then, when no one was watching, I followed everyone into the city.</p>

	<p>I began walking through Geneva, and through these mountains near the city. I knew that one day I would find you. I have waited for this moment for a long time. And now, at last, it is here!</p>
