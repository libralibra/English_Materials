	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER NINE</p>

	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">Mr Rochester's Secrets</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">A</span>fter a little time at Thornfield, I knew that Mr Rochester and I were becoming friends. He was beginning to trust and like me. Many times, when we walked in the garden or sat by a fire in the evening, he told me strange stories of his life and adventures. One day he said to me, "Jane, it is strange that I tell you my secrets, but I know you will never tell anyone else. I know, also, that my stories can't have a bad effect on you. Your mind and heart are too strong and good for that."</p>

	<p>I felt proud and happy that Mr Rochester trusted and liked me so much. I thought about him a lot of the time. I was aware of his faults, but I also saw his kindness and goodness to me. From then on, my happiest times at Thornfield Hall were when I was with him. I could not imagine a more wonderful friend.</p>

	<p>One night I woke up and heard a soft noise. I thought that someone was standing outside my bedroom. I got out of bed and said, "who is there?" Suddenly I heard a strange cry. It sounded like the cry of an animal. Then I heard a door close loudly on the top floor, where Grace Poole stayed. "Did she make the noise?" I wondered. I opened the door and saw that the hall was full of smoke! The door of Mr Rochester's room was open, and I saw the smoke was coming from there! Immediately, I forgot my own danger and ran into his room. He was sleeping in his bed, with fire and smoke all around him. Even the bed was on fire!</p>

	<p>"Mr Rochester! Wake up! Wake up!" I screamed, throwing water on the bed to put out the fire. Not until the fire was almost out did he wake up. He was surprised to see that he was wet.</p>

	<p>"Jane, what is going on? Is there a flood in this house?" he said.</p>

	<p>"No, sir," I answered, "there's been a fire!"</p>

	<p>"Jane Eyre, is it you and your magic?" he asked. "Did you put a spell on me again? Did you want to drown me this time?"</p>

	<p>I did not answer this. "Sir, please get up. Someone has tried to kill you!" I told him about the strange sounds I had heard outside my room and about the fire. He turned very pale, and thought for a few moments.</p>

	<p>"Do you want to talk to Mrs Fairfax, or the other servants, sir?" I asked.</p>

	<p>"No, we shouldn't wake them. Wait here for a moment. I'm going up to the top floor. I'll be back soon."</p>

	<p>I waited in his room for what seemed like a very long time. When he came back, he looked worried.</p>

	<p>"Jane, did you see anything when you opened your bedroom door?" he asked, looking carefully at me.</p>

	<p>"No sir."</p>

	<p>"But you heard a strange laugh?"</p>

	<p>"Yes, I've heard it before. It was like a strange laugh I heard once. I think it is Grace Poole, she laughs like that."</p>

	<p>"Well, perhaps it was Grace Poole who started this fire. I must think about what to do. I'm glad you're the only person who knows about this. Don't tell anyone! Now, go back to your room."</p>

	<p>"Good night, then, sir," I said, walking towards the door.</p>

	<p>"What! Are you leaving me already!" he said. He looked surprised, although he had just told me to go.</p>

	<p>"You said I should go to my room, sir."</p>

	<p>"But not without a kind word or two first! Why, you've saved my life, Jane. I don't like to owe anyone anything, but with you it's different. I'm happy to owe you my life." Suddenly he took both my hands in his. "When I first saw you, Jane, I knew that you would be good for me. I saw it in your eyes when I met you. I was right to like your smile and your face." He spoke softly, and there was a strange light in his eyes.</p>

	<p>"I'm glad I was awake, sir," I said. I was trembling, and I knew I could not control my feelings much longer. I needed time to think. But he still held on to my hands, looking at me. Then I thought of a way to leave.</p>

	<p>"Sir, I think I hear the servants moving," I said.</p>

	<p>"Well, leave me then," he said, and let go of my hands.</p>

	<p>I could not sleep for the rest of the night. My mind was full of strange ideas and deep emotions. I felt that I was falling in love with Mr Rochester, even though he was mysterious sometimes.</p>
