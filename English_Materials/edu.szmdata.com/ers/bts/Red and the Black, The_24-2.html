	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR</p>

	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">A Capital City</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">A</span>t last Julien saw the great black walls of Besan&#xE7;on. How different it would be, he thought, if I came to this city as a soldier instead of as a church student! He thought of history as he walked around the city.</p>

	<p>Fouqu&#x00E9; had given him a plain suit, and he was wearing it. He stopped in front of a large caf&#x00E9;. He was very nervous, but he finally entered. The room was full of smoke. He was too shy to ask anyone for a cup of coffee.</p>

	<p>The girl behind the bar noticed the shy, handsome man and called to him. Julien walked over like a soldier going into battle and dropped his bag on the floor. He decided he needed to be brave, so he said, "Madam, this is the first time in my life I've come to Besan&#xE7;on. I'd like some bread and a cup of coffee. I can pay."</p>

	<p>"Sit here, near me," she said, and she showed off her figure.</p>

	<p>Julien sat down and she gave him a piece of bread. He paused and compared this beautiful girl to Mrs de R&#x00EA;nal. "What's your name?" he asked.</p>

	<p>"Amanda Binet."</p>

	<p>"I'm called Julien Sorel. I have no friends or family here."</p>

	<p>"Oh, I understand!" she said happily. "You're here to study law."</p>

	<p>"No," he replied, "I'm being sent to the school."</p>

	<p>Amanda was disappointed, and went to get the coffee.</p>

	<p>When Amanda came back, Julien asked her to hold his normal clothes. "I can't take them now, but you can send them to me," she said.</p>

	<p>Julien looked into her eyes and said suddenly, "I feel I love you, Amanda."</p>

	<p>Just then her boyfriend came into the caf&#x00E9;. "You have to go right now," she said. "But pay before you go."</p>

	<p>Julien stood outside the caf&#x00E9; for an hour. He had just come to Besan&#xE7;on and he already felt like a failure. He found another inn and put his extra clothes there. He was afraid to go to the school. Julien thought it would be like a prison.</p>
