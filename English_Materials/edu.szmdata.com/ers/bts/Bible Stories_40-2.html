	<p class="storyTitle">40. The Water of Life</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">J</span>esus and the disciples were traveling through Samaria one hot day when they reached a well. The disciples went into the city, but Jesus stayed behind to rest. Soon a Samaritan woman came along, carrying pots to draw water.</p>

	<p>"May I have a drink of water?" Jesus asked her.</p>

	<p>The woman was very surprised that he asked her for water. Jesus was a Jew and Jews did not normally talk to Samaritans.</p>

	<p>"If you knew who you were talking to, you would want me to give you a drink of my water," Jesus said.</p>

	<p>The woman laughed because Jesus had no pots of water with him.</p>

	<p>"The kind of water I give brings eternal life," Jesus told her. "You would never be thirsty again."</p>

	<p>The woman said she would like some of that water, so Jesus told her to bring her husband to the well.</p>

	<p>"I have no husband," she said.</p>

	<p>Jesus told the woman that she had had five husbands and was living with someone else now. The woman was surprised because what Jesus told her was true. She ran home to tell everyone she had met the real Messiah (Hebrew Christ).</p>
