	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER TWENTY</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">T</span>he next day, the Miss Dashwoods went for dinner at Barton Park, and were warmly greeted by Mrs Palmer, looking merry as she ran to meet them. She immediately told them how delighted she was that she could see them, as she and her husband were to leave Barton the next day to visit their dear friends.</p>

	<p>"I am sorry we cannot stay longer; however, we shall meet again in London very soon, I hope."</p>

	<p>The girls then informed her they would not be going to London very soon.</p>

	<p>"Not going to London!" cried Mrs Palmer, with a laugh, "I shall be quite disappointed if you do not. You must come, indeed, I shall be happy to take you around the city myself, at least before I give birth to my child in the spring."</p>

	<p>The girls strongly, but politely, declined her offer to go for a visit.</p>

	<p>Later in the evening, Sir John, with a laugh, began asking Marianne if she had been walking near Willoughby's aunt's home. Marianne looked quite upset afterwards.</p>

	<p>"Oh, don't be shy," said Mrs Palmer, "we know all about it. His home in the country, Combe Magna in Somersetshire, is near our country house, as well. We know young Mr Willoughby extremely well. Although, I have never spoken of him, but I have seen him in London many times."</p>

	<p>Later in the evening, Mrs Palmer went to sit with Elinor.</p>

	<p>"When is your sister to marry Willoughby. I would be so glad to have your sister as a neighbor in Somersetshire."</p>

	<p>"My dear Mrs Palmer. If you believe my sister is soon to be married, then you know more than I do," Elinor said, looking quite shocked.</p>

	<p>"Don't pretend to deny it; everyone talks of it. I met Colonel Brandon Monday morning in London, just before we left town, and he told me the news."</p>

	<p>"And how would Colonel Brandon know of such things?" Elinor asked the merry young woman.</p>

	<p>"Well, when I met him, I asked about the new family in the new cottage, and told him I heard one of them was to marry Willoughby. When I told him what I had heard, he did not say much, but he looked as if he knew it to be true. It will be quite delightful! When is their wedding to take place?"</p>

	<p>"And how is Colonel Brandon?" Elinor quickly asked, refusing to discuss Marianne's relationship with Willoughby any longer.</p>

	<p>"Oh, he is quite well, he said many fine things about you!"</p>

	<p>"He seems to be an excellent man."</p>

	<p>Elinor was quite confused for the rest of the night, after hearing such things from Mrs Palmer about her sister's connection to Willoughby, which she knew very little about.</p>
