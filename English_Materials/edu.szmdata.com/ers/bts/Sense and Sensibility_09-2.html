	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER NINE</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">T</span>he Dashwoods were now settled at Barton. The house and the garden were now becoming familiar to them. Sir John Middleton, who visited them every day for the first two weeks, was always surprised at finding them busy with various activities when he arrived for a visit.</p>

	<p>They had few visitors at the cottage, and did not wish to meet with the neighbors a great deal, although Sir John attempted several times to introduce them to many of the neighbors. The mother and daughters allowed themselves only to visit the neighbors within walking-distance from the cottage. On a walk one day, they walked near a respectable-looking, old respectable house, called Allenham, which reminded them a bit of Norland. They were curious about the owner, but quickly discovered that the owner was a good old woman, Mrs Smith, who was unfortunately too ill to leave her home at any time.</p>

	<p>The Dashwood women enjoyed the beautiful walks through the valleys and hills surrounding the area. One morning, Marianne and Margaret took a long walk through the area. As they were returning to the cottage, they decided to run down the nearest hill to the house. As they were running, however, Marianne fell and hurt her foot. A man who had been hunting nearby saw Marianne fall, and ran to help her. He gently picked her up and carried her to the cottage. Elinor and her mother looked at them in surprise. They were secretly quite pleased with the appearance of the handsome stranger.</p>

	<p>He apologized for surprising them, and requested to return the next day to visit Marianne. He introduced himself as Willoughby, and he explained that he was currently living at Allenham with his aunt, Mrs Smith, whom he visited once a year. Mrs Dashwood happily agreed that he return the following day, and he departed as gracefully as he had arrived.</p>

	<p>Sir John came to see them the next morning, after he had heard the news of Marianne's injured foot. Marianne immediately began asking questions about the mysterious Willoughby.</p>

	<p>"Willoughby!" cried Sir John. "Is he in the area now? That is good news! I will go over tomorrow and ask him to dinner on Thursday."</p>

	<p>"You know him then?" asked Mrs Dashwood.</p>

	<p>"Yes, very well. He comes here every year."</p>

	<p>"And what sort of young man is he?"</p>

	<p>"He is a very kind young gentleman, I assure you," replied Sir John.</p>

	<p>"Is that all you know of him?" asked Marianne, looking annoyed. "What are his interests and talents?"</p>

	<p>"Well," said he, "I do not know much about him, but he is pleasant and friendly, and has got the nicest little black bitch of a hunting dog I ever saw. Was she out hunting with him?"</p>

	<p>Marianne was quite dissatisfied with his answer.</p>

	<p>"But who is he?" asked Elinor. "Where does he come from? Does he have a house at Allenham?"</p>

	<p>Sir John then explained that Mr Willoughby had no property of his own in the area, but he lived there while visiting the old lady, who was his aunt. He was to receive her land and fortune at her death.</p>

	<p>"He is a good young man, I believe," repeated Sir John. "I remember last Christmas, at a dance at Barton Park, he danced from eight o'clock till four, without once sitting down." "Did he, indeed?" cried Marianne with an excitement, "and with grace and elegance?"</p>

	<p>"Yes, and he was up the next morning at eight for hunting."</p>

	<p>"That is what a young man should be like. That is what I like. He should be eager in all his interests."</p>

	<p>"I understand now, you have chosen your husband now, and will not look at poor Colonel Brandon any longer," said Sir John with a smile. "Poor Brandon!"</p>
