	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER FIFTY-TWO</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">E</span>mma was relieved to find that Harriet, as well, wanted to avoid meeting. In her letter, Harriet did not seem upset with Emma, she was polite and civil, although Emma suspected Harriet somewhat resented her.</p>

	<p>Harriet had been having tooth problems, and had wished to see a dentist. Emma thought Harriet should go for a visit to London to see a dentist, and stay with the Knightleys. Isabella was delighted. Harriet was to go for at least two weeks. Now, Emma could, indeed, enjoy Mr Knightley's visits in true happiness.</p>

	<p>She soon decided that she should visit Miss Fairfax; she wished to speak to her. Emma went and was invited in immediately. Jane eagerly greeted her. Emma had never seen her look so well, and so beautiful.</p>

	<p>Emma was pleased. She soon noticed Mrs Elton sitting with Mrs Bates. Mrs Elton came forward to greet Emma, and was quite friendly. Emma soon understood Mrs Elton's reason for such friendly behaviour. Mrs Elton believed only she knew Miss Fairfax's secret news.</p>

	<p>"Do not you think, Miss Woodhouse, our friend has recovered quite well? Mr Perry is an incredible doctor," (then looked at Jane with a smile). Mrs Elton made such comments often throughout Emma's visit, often looking at Jane with a secret look of meaning. "I haven't seen you, Miss Woodhouse, since Box Hill. Some members of our group seemed quite upset during the visit. However, we shall all go again very soon. We shall go with the same group as before."</p>

	<p>Emma felt that she should return home immediately. Mr Knightley was probably there waiting for her. She was pleased to find Miss Fairfax walk with her out of the room. As they left the room, Emma spoke:</p>

	<p>"I wanted to speak to you about something, but there were many people in the room, so I did not want to discuss it then."</p>

	<p>"Oh!" cried Jane, "They know about the engagement. Miss Woodhouse, I apologize for my cold behaviour. You are very kind."</p>

	<p>"Say no more! I feel I should apologize to you! Let us forgive each other."</p>
