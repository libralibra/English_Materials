	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER SEVEN</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">I</span> was quite successful in my adventures as a thief. My nurse often persuaded me to continue my life as a thief, although I became rather worried, at times. During one robbery, I dressed in black, as a widow whose husband had recently died. I wandered around the city looking for robbery opportunities. As I walked, I heard someone screaming, "Stop, thief! Stop, thief!" Someone had dressed in black as a widow, and robbed a nearby shop. Just then, a crowd gathered around me, and one man, the shopkeeper's assistant, declared that I had been the thief. I was immediately brought to the shop where the shopkeeper announced that I had not been the thief. Others insisted, however, that I remain at the shop until the police officer arrived. The officer soon came, but I was still not allowed to leave, as the officer declared that I would soon be in Newgate. Soon enough, however, the true thief was brought into the shop, and the shopkeeper announced that this woman, indeed, was the thief. I then demanded that we immediately go to court. The shopkeeper apologized for refusing to let me leave earlier. On our way to the court, the actual thief had run away, but we continued to court. Nearly 500 people followed us, curious to see what was happening.</p>

	<p>We soon arrived, and the judge asked that we explain what had happened. He first asked my name, so I had to tell him my name was Mary Flanders. I then explained that my husband was a sea captain who had died while traveling to Virginia, and that I was living with my nurse for a short time before leaving for America. I then told the judge the story of the shopkeeper's assistant treating me as a criminal, although the shopkeeper had declared that I was not the thief, and that they decided to keep me at the shop. After I concluded the story, the judge declared that I was free to leave. I returned home to my nurse quickly to explain the terrible story. When I finished explaining what had happened, she began laughing. I was shocked to see her laughing, as I was greatly disturbed after what had happened.</p>

	<p>"I laugh, child," she said, "because of how lucky you are. You shall make the shopkeeper and his assistant pay five hundred pounds to you for the way they treated you."</p>

	<p>I was worried, however, that I had told the judge my name was Mary Flanders. My name was famous in Newgate, and I was quite troubled to go to court against the shopkeeper for five hundred pounds. My nurse hired an excellent lawyer who explained that we would not have to return to court to demand the five hundred pounds from the shopkeeper. He soon went to speak with the shopkeeper, explaining that if he would agree to pay me five hundred pounds for troubling me, then I would not force him to return to the court. He told the frightened shopkeeper that I was a woman of fortune, with many wealthy friends who were quite upset that I was treated so horribly by the shopkeeper and his assistant. After some time, the shopkeeper offered fifty pounds, but my lawyer demanded five hundred pounds. So, they continued to disagree for some time. Finally, my lawyer informed me that the shopkeeper was eager to have a meeting between us. I agreed; my lawyer requested that I dress as a woman of fortune to show the shopkeeper I was, indeed, quite wealthy.</p>

	<p>I arrived to the meeting in new clothing, a necklace made of pearls and diamonds that my nurse had given me to use for the meeting, a good gold watch, and my maid at my side. When I came into the room, the shopkeeper looked quite surprised to see that I appeared to be quite wealthy. The shopkeeper complimented my elegant clothing. I told him I believed he would not have treated me so rudely if he had known of my wealth.</p>

	<p>He told me he was very sorry for what had happened. He explained that he was willing to pay me for my suffering, and hoped that we could agree not to return to court. I replied that I did not intend to ruin him, but my friends insisted that I must be paid for my suffering. After some discussion of payment, we agreed that he would pay me one hundred and fifty pounds, my lawyer's fees, and make me a suit of black silk.</p>

	<p>I was now, indeed, quite a wealthy woman, as I had nearly seven hundred pounds, besides clothes, rings, two gold watches, and some silver, and all of them stolen. I could no longer resist going out as a thief; the possibilities of the adventures excited me.</p>

	<p>A short time after the misunderstanding with the shopkeeper was finished, I dressed as a beggar woman, hoping to cheat people. I walked around the city, looking in every door and window. I hated being dirty, so this adventure was quite short, as it was not suitable to me. Everyone I met seemed to be afraid of me, and would not walk near me. I did not find many opportunities while out dressed as a beggar woman. One night, I was standing near the doorway of an inn when a man came near on horseback. He looked around for a few moments, looking for a place to keep his horse safe. He asked that I watch his horse for him while he was inside. Soon after he walked in, I took the horse away and took it to my nurse.</p>

	<p>We did not know what to do with the horse, as my nurse and I knew not where to sell the horse. After some time, we decided that we should take the horse to another inn, then send a letter to the gentleman's inn explaining that the horse had been lost, but was later found.</p>

	<p>So this was a robbery and no robbery, as I neither gained nor lost anything through it. After this adventure, I decided I no longer wished to dress as a beggar woman, as I earned very little on my adventures out.</p>

	<p>I decided, instead, to dress as a wealthy gentlewoman, which had previously given me several opportunities as a thief; most people believed thieves could not look wealthy. One afternoon, I was in a clothing shop at the other side of town, watching a shopkeeper take out an expensive piece of lace. A moment later, people outside started screaming that the queen would soon walk down the street. Everyone, including the shopkeepers turned to watch the queen walk by. As the crowd was watching carefully, I cautiously took the lace before quietly walking out of the shop. I slowly walked to find a carriage, as I did not wish to be caught walking down the street with the lace. Just after I stepped into the carriage, I heard loud screams coming closer. I did not hear, "Stop, thief!" because nobody ran away, but I could hear the words "robbed" and "lace," and I became quite uneasy. A moment later, the carriage driver was ready and we left. I brought my new lace home to my nurse, which was worth nearly twenty pounds.</p>

	<p>The next day, I dressed up again as a woman of fortune, and walked near the same shop. I walked to the park where I saw a great number of wealthy women. Soon, I noticed a young miss of thirteen or fourteen years old step out of a carriage with her sister of about nine years old. The two girls had no maid with them, only the carriage driver. The little miss told the driver to wait while the two girls walked through the park for a short time. After the girls went into the park, I walked towards the driver, asking about the two girls, remarking that they were quite well-mannered, pretty girls. Soon enough, I walked into the park, calling the girl by her name, Lady Betty. I began asking her about her parents, telling the girl that I was a dear friend of her mother. We walked around the park together, talking about her parents and her dear little sister. Soon, the king walked by, and all in the park turned to see him go by. I helped Lady Betty to stand nearby to see the king, while I took her gold watch. The crowd of people began to move along the park as the king walked by. I left the two girls, saying, "Dear Lady Betty, take care of your little sister." And so, I left with the crowd. I later heard that upon returning to her carriage, she discovered that her gold watch was gone. She explained me in great detail, and the driver knew I had been the woman, and he searched around the park for a great deal of time.</p>

	<p>I was quite fortunate in my work as a thief. My nurse and I became quite wealthy through our adventures. In the past, I had thought of retiring from such work, but my nurse insisted that we continue. Now, my nurse attempted to persuade me to end my work as a thief, but I was more courageous than before in my adventures. With my success, I became the most famous thief in London.</p>

	<p>It was the day after Christmas that I went out to a silver shop. I looked around the shop, and saw that no one was in the shop. I was about to steal a few pieces of silver when I saw a man from the other side of the street come running into the shop. He then grabbed my hand and called for the owners of the shop to come.</p>

	<p>I had not touched anything in the shop, and when I saw him running over, I called for the shop owners to come. I had always had the most courage when I was in the most danger, so when he stopped me, I said that I came from the countryside to buy some silver spoons. The man laughed when I spoke, declaring that I was lying. A crowd of people now surrounded the shop, curious to find out what had happened. This man insisted that I came to steal, but he had to prove it; I demanded that we go immediately to court.</p>

	<p>The owners of the shop were rather polite, but were confused on what to do. As we were discussing what to do, the town judge came into the shop, offering to hear the story and offer advice. The shop owner explained what had happened quite honestly. Then, the man from across the street told his story with foolish anger. I then explained that I had come from the countryside to buy six silver spoons. Luckily, I had a silver spoon in my pocket, which I showed them, telling them that I wished for the owner of the shop to make six others in the same manner.</p>

	<p>The judge asked the neighbour if I had, indeed, called for the shop owner; the neighbour admitted that I had, but insisted that I had because I saw the neighbour running towards the shop.</p>

	<p>"You told me earlier that this woman could not see you, as she was not facing the street. Now, you say that she did see you coming," the judge told the neighbour.</p>

	<p>Now, it was true that I was facing the inside of the shop, rather than the street. However, my business as a thief required that I watch every direction, so I really did see the man come running towards the shop, though he did not notice.</p>

	<p>After hearing each story, the judge decided that I was not guilty, as I had not yet attempted to steal anything in the shop, which the shop owner and his wife agreed with. As I was leaving, however, the judge reminded me that I had come to buy six silver spoons, and remarked that he hoped that I would still buy them.</p>

	<p>"I'll buy the spoons still if he can match this spoon." I responded, as I showed him my silver spoon. He found the spoons and told me they were thirty-five shillings, so I took out my purse to pay him, in which I had nearly twenty guineas. I never went out as a thief without taking at least twenty guineas with me. I discovered that carrying such an amount of money was useful if I had trouble.</p>

	<p>When the judge saw my money, he said, "Well, madam, now I believe you did not come here to steal. I insisted that you buy the spoons because if you did not have the money to pay for them, I would have suspected that you did not come into the shop to buy, as most thieves do not carry much money with them."</p>

	<p>So I left the situation quite well, after coming so close to being caught, and became more confident as a thief.</p>

	<p>Only three days after that affair, having become more courageous, I walked into a house where I saw the doors open. I took two pieces of silk, then went to the door to leave before two maids grabbed me. One of them pulled me back into the room while the other shut the door. They screamed and tore my clothes, as if they were about to murder me. Then, the owner of the house came running in.</p>

	<p>I told the owner that I came in because I saw the door open, and was tempted by the elegant furniture inside. I was poor, and had no money for food. I begged him with tears to have pity on me. His wife felt pity for me, and almost persuaded her husband to let me go, but the two angry maids had already left the house to get a police officer.</p>

	<p>The officer soon arrived. Seeing him scared me greatly, and I began to cry again. The people there thought I would have died. The wife argued to let me leave, and the officer almost permitted me to go, as I had not been allowed to take anything. One of the maids, however, reminded the officer that I would have left the house if she had not caught me. So, the officer took me to Newgate, that terrible place! I feel ill at hearing the name; the place where so many of my partners had been taken to die; the place where my mother suffered, where I was born, and from where I expected to die an infamous death, which I had successfully avoided for so long.</p>

	<p>It is impossible to describe how terrified I was at being in Newgate for the first time since my birth, after seeing so many I knew return there. I now blamed myself for returning to Newgate. I had no need for earning money, and knew there were many risks in my dangerous work. I now regretted all the evil work I had done. I regretted the work not because I hurt others in my evil doings, but that I was punished for committing the crimes.</p>

	<p>I slept little the first few nights in that miserable prison. The first night there, I sent a message to my nurse that I was caught and sent to Newgate. She spent the night out of Newgate almost as ill as I was inside the prison. The next morning she came to see me to cheer me up, but there was no way to improve my feelings of regret and hopelessness. She immediately began to prevent my being killed in prison. First, she went to the two maids, and offered them nearly one hundred pounds to leave the city so they would not go to court to explain what I had done. The maids refused, although her yearly income was only three hundred pounds. My nurse told me that the maids would have refused if she had offered them five hundred pounds. Then, she spoke with the owners of the home. The wife had pitied me greatly, and her husband had, as well, but her husband had since decided to go to court.</p>

	<p>At first, while in prison, I was horrified at being in Newgate, the place of so much misery and death. I thought of death during the day and night, thinking of all the evil things I had done in the past. The prison minister came to speak to me, at times. He told me that if I did not admit all of my past evil behaviour, then God would never forgive me. He would come to see me in the morning, declaring that I must admit my wrongdoing, and ask God to forgive me, but then I would see the poor man asleep in the afternoon, after drinking a bottle of wine. I began to fear seeing that man, and wished not to see him any longer.</p>

	<p>I was sorry that I was in Newgate, but I still did not regret my evil life before prison. I first became stupid and senseless, and then became a thoughtless animal, and at last I became crazy, just as all the rest were. I became pleased and easy with the place, as if, indeed, I had been born there and lived there all my life.</p>

	<p>I was healthy with a great fortune, but was in a place I believed to be the most horrible in the world. I felt guilty, as I know I had committed terrible crimes, but I was terrified that I had been caught, not that I had committed any crimes. Now, however, I felt nothing. I had committed a crime, and would soon die because of it. I was famous as a criminal, and there was no way to escape. I had no hope to save myself. I knew that I would most certainly die soon. Therefore, I no longer had any sadness or fear. The past forty years of my life were evil, filled with lying, cheating, and stealing. I no longer cared that I was to die soon; I could think of nothing.</p>

	<p>All my terrifying thoughts were past, the horrors of Newgate became familiar. All my life, I had had excellent manners and behaviour, but in Newgate, I became as evil as the rest. I was no longer the same woman I had been before entering that prison of terror.</p>

	<p>During this time, however, I had a sudden surprise, which reminded me of my life before coming to Newgate. I was told one night that three men were brought to the prison who had robbed several carriages in the countryside. We prisoners were rather curious to see these brave men, who had been so successful for quite some time as robbers. The next morning, the men were taken through the prison. I was shocked to see that one of the three was my husband who had attempted to cheat me by telling me he had a fortune in Ireland, and the same husband who I had seen just after I married my last husband in the countryside. I was shocked to see him, although he did not recognise me, which eased me greatly. I returned to my room and cried for quite some time.</p>

	<p>"Evil woman that I am!" said I, "how many poor people have to suffer because of my evil doings." This gentleman had returned to robberies after discovering that I, indeed, had no fortune. I had never admitted that I had a great fortune, but I had certainly encouraged him to believe so. I was told that he was the leader of the thieves, and had robbed many people in the countryside; he would soon die for his crimes.</p>

	<p>I felt great pity for this man that I had loved so dearly. My own death, which would come soon, was no bother to me; I was worried only about my dear husband, who had suffered greatly because of me. I then remembered the horrors of the prison, and again became quite terrified of my coming death.</p>

	<p>My dear nurse came to see me often. She acted like a true mother to me; she pitied me, she cried with me and for me, but she could not help me. I could hear other prisoners talking, who all agreed that I should die for my terrible crimes. Soon enough, another prisoner informed me that I would go to court the next Friday, only two days away.</p>

	<p>"Well, Mrs Flanders, I'll advise you that you should prepare for death," the prisoner told me. I became weak upon hearing the news, and could not speak.</p>
