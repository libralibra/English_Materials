	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER THIRTEEN</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">D</span>uring the Knightley family visit to the Woodhouse home, the family was invited to the Westons' house for a Christmas dinner. Harriet, Mr Elton, and Mr George Knightley would take a carriage together, and meet the Woodhouses and the Knightleys at the Westons' home. Unfortunately, Harriet was ill that day, and was not allowed to leave her bed. Harriet was quite disappointed, and cried many tears.</p>

	<p>Emma told her that Mr Elton would be rather upset, as well, that Harriet could not join them. When Emma left Harriet, she met Mr Elton, who was coming to ask about Harriet's illness.</p>

	<p>"A sore throat! I hope we are not soon ill," exclaimed Mr Elton.</p>

	<p>"Mr Elton, you look ill yourself, perhaps you should stay home," Emma calmly suggested.</p>

	<p>Mr Elton looked confused, and did not know how to answer. He was grateful for Emma's care, but was still quite interested in going to the Westons' for the evening. Emma was pleased with herself for giving Mr Elton a reason to stay near Harriet to watch over her all evening.</p>

	<p>"I will tell Mr and Mrs Weston you are ill. You will feel better tomorrow," Emma told the disappointed Mr Elton.</p>

	<p>However, Mr George Knightley soon offered to take Mr Elton to the Westons' if he was not too ill. Mr Elton looked delighted at Mr Knightley's offer.</p>

	<p>Emma was confused that Mr Elton would choose to leave Harriet alone ill. Mr Elton left them to say goodbye to Harriet.</p>

	<p>Emma thought to herself, "Well, Mr Elton is very much in love with Harriet, but still cannot refuse a dinner invitation."</p>

	<p>After a few minutes, John Knightley began to speak:</p>

	<p>"Mr Elton seems to be in love with you, he takes every suggestion you offer with great consideration."</p>

	<p>"Me!" Emma replied with a smile, "Do you think Mr Elton is in love with me?"</p>

	<p>"It is possible. You should think about how you speak to him because your behaviour encourages him."</p>

	<p>"Mr Elton and I are very good friends, and nothing more," and she walked on, amused at Mr Knightley's words. He obviously did not understand the situation between Mr Elton and Harriet.</p>

	<p>Mr Woodhouse was so excited about the visit that he ignored the cold weather, which would usually quite upset him. Mr John Knightley, however, was not pleased with the long journey.</p>

	<p>"We should stay home in this terrible weather. It is snowing at this moment! There is no reason why we should have to leave our warm homes to travel a great distance in this weather for a five-hour visit."</p>

	<p>As they arrived, Emma saw Mr Elton waiting, smiling with pleasure. Emma was surprised that Mr Elton could be so content with Harriet at home ill with a fever.</p>

	<p>"Before we left, Harriet's nurse told me she was not feeling better today," Emma informed him.</p>

	<p>"Oh no&#151;I went to visit her this morning, and was told that she is much worse, but I thought that your morning visit would cure her," Mr Elton replied.</p>

	<p>"Yes, but we will miss her tonight."</p>

	<p>"Of course, she will be missed every moment," Mr Elton sighed.</p>

	<p>Emma was disappointed to find that only a few seconds after his last statement, he began to speak of other things with excitement in his voice.</p>
