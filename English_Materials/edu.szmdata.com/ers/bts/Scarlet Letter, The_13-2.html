	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER THIRTEEN</p>

	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">Another View of Hester</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">I</span>n her one interview with Mr Dimmesdale, Hester Prynne was shocked at his weak condition, as he could hardly stand after observing his enemy, Roger Chillingworth. With her knowledge of the true relationship between Roger Chillingworth and Arthur Dimmesdale, she knew that aside from the minister's own feelings of guilt, the old doctor had greatly added to the poor minister's suffering and pain. Knowing how strong and brave this young man once was, she decided that she must explain the true identity of the mysterious Roger Chillingworth. Thinking of the terror with which he had begged her&#151;the criminal woman&#151;for support against his enemy.</p>

	<p>Hester Prynne was no longer the same woman of seven years ago, standing on a platform before the town, frightened with a child in her arms. Pearl was now seven years old. Her mother, with the scarlet letter on her chest, had become familiar with the townspeople. Hester Prynne never quarreled with the public, but obeyed uncomplainingly.</p>

	<p>She never asked for more than enough to take care of little Pearl and herself. The rest, she spent on clothing and food for others with less money than she had. Although, she never received any thanks from those she supported. Still, she continued her work tirelessly. The letter on her chest represented her work on earth, always helping others, without expecting any thanks. Many people refused to see the scarlet "A" by its first meaning, and said that it meant "Able"; so strong was Hester Prynne, with a woman's strength.</p>

	<p>If she passed someone in town, she never raised her head to greet them. If they greeted her, she laid her finger on the scarlet letter, and walked by.</p>

	<p>The rulers of the town, as well as the religious leaders, took longer to speak fondly of Hester's good qualities than the people. However, they did eventually agree to the town's declaration of her being forgiven. The townspeople looked at the scarlet letter, not as representing her sin, but rather as representing her good deeds. "Do you see that woman in the scarlet letter?" they would say to strangers. "It is our Hester&#151;the town's own Hester&#151;who is so kind to the poor and so helpful to the sick!"</p>

	<p>The effect of the scarlet letter&#151;or rather, of her societal position within the community, had been great. All the beauty she had previously had was now faded, as was the poor clothing she wore under her bright scarlet letter. Her rich black hair had been cut off or was completely hidden by a cap. When a woman has lived through a difficult experience, her character changes a great deal. If she be all tenderness, she will die. If she survive, the tenderness will leave her.</p>

	<p>Much of the coldness of Hester's character was because her life had turned from great passion and feeling to thought, as she was no longer allowed to express her great feelings after she was punished by society. The world's laws were no longer the laws of Hester Prynne. Upon having her child, Hester became more calm and thoughtful. In the education of her child, the mother's joy of thought had begun. Everything was against her. The world was unfriendly. The child's own wild nature continually reminded the mother that she was born out of a crime of passion. Hester often asked herself, in the bitterness of her heart, whether it was for good or evil that the poor girl was born.</p>

	<p>Indeed, she often thought about the role of women in society. She long ago decided that the whole system of society must be destroyed and built again. Then, men's role in society must change considerably before women can be allowed to have a fair and suitable position. Of course, these problems will never be fixed, Hester has realized. At times, she wondered in fear if she should have rather sent Pearl immediately to Heaven, and die, herself as well.</p>

	<p>The punishment of the scarlet letter had not served its purpose.</p>

	<p>Now, however, her night meeting with the minister Mr Dimmesdale had given her a new purpose. She had seen the terrible misery in which the minister struggled. She saw that he would soon go mad, if he had not already become so. The secret enemy always by his side, pretending to be the closest friend and helper, had mined the poor minister. Hester felt guilty for leaving the weak minister with the evil doctor, with no wisdom about his reasons for befriending the young minister.</p>

	<p>Since their conversation in the prison after the old doctor had arrived in town, Hester realized that her position in society had risen greatly, while his had declined terribly. Hester then decided that she must meet with her former husband, and to attempt to rescue his victim from ruin. One afternoon, walking with Pearl near the seashore, she saw the old doctor looking for herbs and plants to use as medicine.</p>
