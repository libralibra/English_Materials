	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">Tom Becomes a Hero</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">S</span>o everyone in the village was again talking about Tom. People, both young and old, respected him more and more. The village newspaper wrote a story about him, and this impressed people even more. Some thought him great enough to one day become the American President.</p>

	<p>So Muff Potter was now free again, and everyone treated him like they had before he'd been arrested. He seemed to forgive most of the people for hating him so much while he was in jail.</p>

	<p>Even though these were exciting days for Tom, he was still very frightened about Indian Joe. And Huck was also afraid. Although he was happy for Muff Potter, he was angry with Tom for breaking their agreement. He worried that some people might know that he'd been there too. But most of all, he feared that Indian Joe knew. And no one knew where Indian Joe was hiding.</p>
