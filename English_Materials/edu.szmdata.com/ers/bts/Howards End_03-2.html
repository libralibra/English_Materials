	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER THREE</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">I</span>t was quite seldom that Aunt Munt could help the two girls. They had both become so independent since their mother, Emily, died giving birth to Tibby. Aunt Munt had offered to take over the household responsibilities, but Margaret, being the oldest at thirteen years of age, had said it was unnecessary, for they could look after things themselves. When their father died five years later, and Mrs Munt once again offered her services, she was politely refused one more time. In fact, the only thing that she was successful with was in getting the girls to save their money by investing in the stocks of local companies. She also worried about her nieces meeting young men. There were quite a large number of young people in the neighborhood, artists and other strange types. She felt that it was dangerous for the girls. Soon they would be putting themselves out into the world for men to capture, and Aunt Munt wanted to make sure that they married the right kind of men. So, she was quite pleased to be taking this train ride north to have a look at this boy whom Helen had written about.</p>

	<p>The train passed through the outer parts of London. Mrs Munt saw areas that were becoming uglier and uglier with increasing industrialism. It threatened to spread further into the center of town, but she paid no attention. Nothing else mattered more to her than helping Helen to get out of this horrible situation.</p>

	<p>Arriving at the Hilton station, Mrs Munt found the little town was recently made more modern. There was a subway system and many new buildings that lacked the beauty of England's older structures. Yet there still remained a few traditional, friendly-looking places.</p>

	<p>"I'm looking for Howards House," she asked the ticket person. "Do you know where I could find it?"</p>

	<p>The ticket person yelled out, "Wilcox!" and another man behind him turned around. "She's asking about Howards End."</p>

	<p>Mrs Munt felt very embarrassed, but quickly gathered her courage and said, "Ah, so you're a Wilcox. Are you the youngest or oldest in the family?"</p>

	<p>"I'm the youngest, ma'am," he answered, "How can I help you?"</p>

	<p>"Oh&#160;... well&#160;... you see&#160;... I'm Helen Schlegel's aunt. Is she here with you?"</p>

	<p>"Yes, she's staying at my family's home," he said without feeling. "If you want to go and see her, I'd be happy to give you a ride in my car. Just give me one moment to wait for a package I'm expecting."</p>

	<p>"Of course. Thank you."</p>

	<p>"I just brought my father to the station. He's just left on a business trip," young Wilcox explained. "What is taking them so long with my package?" Then, speaking to the workers in the postal room, "Hey, you there! I've been waiting much too long. Are you giving me my package or not?" Then returning to Mrs Munt, "My God, how I'd love it if all of these men could be fired! Their work is absolutely terrible!"</p>

	<p>He then helped her into the car, which she thought was very luxurious. She was impressed with the way the young man seemed so sure of himself. She found herself being more polite to him than she had planned.</p>

	<p>"Yes, this is quite good," she said, "I'd hoped it might be like this. You see, I received a letter from Helen just this morning."</p>

	<p>He did not seem to hear this and busied himself with filling the car with gas. One of the workers then came carrying the package.</p>

	<p>"Well, finally, then," complained young Wilcox. "Next time, I'll be speaking with your boss!"</p>

	<p>He then got into the front seat and started the car engine. "Would you mind if we go through the village? I have a few things that I need to do on the way home."</p>

	<p>"Not at all," she said, "There is quite a lot for us to talk about, of course. This will give us more time to talk."</p>

	<p>He did not respond immediately, but began to drive away from the train station.</p>

	<p>"What is it that you wanted to talk with me about?" he asked.</p>

	<p>"Well&#160;... the big news, of course."</p>

	<p>"I'm sorry. I don't understand."</p>

	<p>"I'm talking about Helen! I know all about you two. Her sister, Margaret, wanted to come, but couldn't, so I've come instead."</p>

	<p>He drove very quickly into town and, without saying a word, stopped in front of a cloth store. A man, holding curtain material, came running down to the car from the front door and handed his bundle to Wilcox. Then they were off driving quickly down the road again, sending dust and dirt flying in every direction: into windows, onto flowers, into the mouths of people on the street.</p>

	<p>"They really ought to change this road," he said.</p>

	<p>Mrs Munt just stared at him in surprise. She began to think that she had made a big mistake.</p>

	<p>"I'm sorry, but I still don't really know what you're talking about?" he finally said. "Helen and me? Oh&#160;... unless you mean Paul has gotten himself into some trouble."</p>

	<p>"You're not Paul?" asked Mrs Munt.</p>

	<p>"No, I'm Charles."</p>

	<p>"But&#160;... at the station&#160;... you said you were Paul!"</p>

	<p>"No, I didn't!"</p>

	<p>She began to feel a little angry with the young man. She did not like his attitude. He was talking to her as if she were lower than himself.</p>

	<p>"So, my brother Paul has gone and fallen in love with your niece, has he? Fool! What a stupid fool he is! I'm sorry, but it's impossible. They cannot remain together!"</p>

	<p>"I couldn't agree more!" shouted Mrs Munt, now angrier than before. "I don't want her wasting her time with a man who won't realize how special she is! I plan to take her back to London with me!"</p>

	<p>"Anyway, he can only marry a woman who is willing to live in Africa. That's where he will be going soon. He has no money, at all! What a fool! And why did your niece have to open her big mouth and tell everyone about it?"</p>

	<p>"If I weren't a woman, I'd hit you in the face for saying such a thing!"</p>

	<p>"Well, it wasn't my brother who&#160;...&#160;"</p>

	<p>"Enough! Shut up!"</p>

	<p>Young Wilcox started driving faster and moving the car quickly side to side along the road. This scared poor Mrs Munt terribly and she screamed. They argued for the rest of the drive to Howards End. Both behaved like children and said terrible things about one another's family. When they finally arrived at the Wilcox home, they saw Helen come running out the front door, her face as white as a bed sheet.</p>

	<p>"Auntie! Margaret sent me a telegram! I was hoping to stop you from coming! Please don't say anything to anyone. There's nothing between Paul and me. We've ended it. Please say nothing!"</p>

	<p>But Charles had already jumped out of the car and was shouting for Paul. A younger man came walking out of the front door.</p>

	<p>"Is it true, this story I've heard about you and Miss Schlegel?"</p>

	<p>"Please, Charles. Do calm down for a moment," said a voice from the garden. It was Mrs Wilcox. She was wearing a long dress, just as Helen had described in her letter. She immediately gave orders to Paul to ask his sister, Evie, to make lunch for everyone, and for Helen to take her aunt upstairs to rest for a moment.</p>

	<p>"But mother, do you know what your son Paul has been up to?" cried Charles.</p>

	<p>"Yes, and it's all over now. There won't be any marriage."</p>
