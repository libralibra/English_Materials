	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">Dreams</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">T</span>he next day, the 10th of January, the Nautilus continued on its journey at nearly thirty-five miles an hour. I went up to the platform and found the captain looking at the sea through one of his glass instruments for quite some time. He then turned to another crew-member to say something in their strange language. The other man looked quite upset, with tears in his eyes. I wondered about what the captain was looking for, as we were hundreds of miles away from land. I went down into the sitting room where I found another instrument for seeing faraway distances. I went again to the platform to look when the captain threw the instrument out of my hand.</p>

	<p>Had I upset the captain? Had he thought I discovered some secret of his? No, he was not angry with me, as he was now looking again at that spot far away from us.</p>

	<p>"Professor Aronnax," he said calmly after a few moments, "I must have you and your companions restricted from this area for now." I was then taken to the room where I spent the first night aboard the Nautilus. Ned Land and Conseil were there, as well.</p>

	<p>Our breakfast soon arrived, and Ned was disappointed to see only food from the sea on our plates. Soon enough, Ned fell asleep, and I was surprised to see Conseil fall asleep, as well. I tried to resist sleep, but it was impossible. I could do nothing but close my eyes.</p>
