	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE</p>

	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">Strassburg</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">T</span>rapped in Strassburg for a week, Julien thought only of Mathilde. She was in control of his happiness. Ambition could make him forget his love of Mrs de R&#x00EA;nal, but nothing could make him forget Mathilde.</p>

	<p>He was unhappy until he heard someone yell to him. Julien looked up and saw his friend from London, Prince Korasov. "You're not acting like I taught you," Korasov said. "Looking unhappy is bad. To be aristocratic you must look bored.</p>

	<p>"What's wrong? Have you lost your money or are you in love with some actress?"</p>

	<p>This joke almost made Julien cry. "To be honest, I am in love. She doesn't love me anymore." Julien told his story, but he made new names for everyone.</p>

	<p>"I am your doctor," the prince said. Here's what to do:</p>

	<p>1. See her everyday, but don't be cold.</p>

	<p>2. Pay attention to another woman.</p>

	<p>"What other woman will you choose?"</p>

	<p>"I know a woman," Julien said, "who is very rich and does not love anyone." He was thinking of Mrs de Fervaques, whose husband was dead.</p>

	<p>"That's perfect!" Korasov said. "Write two letters to her everyday. You don't even have to invent them; I have six boxes of letters ready for you to copy."</p>

	<p>Julien was much happier when he went to bed that night.</p>

	<p>Julien and his friend went riding everyday. Prince Korasov really liked Julien, and finally he said, "I have a cousin in Moscow. You should marry her! With my uncle's influence and the Legion of Honor cross you have, you'll go far in the army."</p>

	<p>I can't do that, Julien thought. Leaving Mathilde would be too painful. I won't take my friend's cousin, but I'll take his advice. I'll seduce Mrs de Fervaques. She may be boring, but her eyes are like the woman I love.</p>
