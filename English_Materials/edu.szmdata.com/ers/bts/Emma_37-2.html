	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER THIRTY-SEVEN</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">E</span>mma understood her nervousness after hearing of Frank Churchill's coming. She decided she was no longer in love with him, but she believed that he must still be in love with her. She worried about what to say to him if he told her he loved her. Although, she knew she would have to refuse a marriage proposal, she could never leave her father.</p>

	<p>The Churchills finally arrived in London, and Frank Churchill soon came to Highbury. When he came to the Woodhouse home for a visit, Emma had no doubt about him being less in love with her. She reasoned that he was afraid to fall in love with her again, and therefore, made his visit quite short. His behaviour during the visit was rather strange. He was not calm, and quite restless. He advised the Woodhouses that his visit would be quick because he had many people in Highbury to visit.</p>

	<p>This was the only visit from Frank Churchill for the next ten days. He had attempted to come again, but each time, his aunt was too ill to let him leave her. Mrs Churchill's behaviour upset Mr Weston, of course, but he did not say anything on the subject. Soon, Mrs Churchill decided that she no longer wanted to stay in London, so the family moved to Richmond, a quiet city closer to Highbury. Mr Weston was delighted.</p>

	<p>After the Churchills moved to Richmond, Frank Churchill came to Highbury more often. Emma, the Westons, and Frank Churchill began to plan the next dance, which they talked about during Frank's last stay.</p>
