	<p class="storyTitle">5. The Tower of Babel</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">N</span>oah and his sons obeyed God's command to have many children. Soon the earth was populated again with lots of people. Some of the people were good and followed God's word. But there were some who wanted to gather in one place and build a city and a great tower to honor themselves.</p>

	<p>God was very unhappy with these people because they were not following his plan for them.</p>

	<p>The people who worked on the tower all spoke the same language as everyone who lived on the earth did during that time. God divided them into different groups and made them speak different languages. They could not understand one another, and they had to give up building their city and the great tower.</p>

	<p>The people then scattered to other lands and their tower sat unfinished. They called it the Tower of Babel, because "babel" means "mixed up."</p>
