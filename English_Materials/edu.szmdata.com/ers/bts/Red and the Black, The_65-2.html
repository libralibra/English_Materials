	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER THIRTY-FIVE</p>

	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">Peace</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">L</span>ater two lawyers came. They were Julien's defense.</p>

	<p>"It was murder," Julien said. "I'm very sorry about it, but you have little work to do."</p>

	<p>I must be braver than these men, Julien thought. They fear death, but I will not think about it until the day it comes.</p>

	<p>One lawyer believed, like most of Besan&#xE7;on, that jealousy was Julien's reason. He said this could be a good defense.</p>

	<p>"If you value your life," Julien said angrily, "you will never say that lie again."</p>

	<p>The names of the jury members were soon chosen. Vicar-general de Frilair was happy to see that the list had five members of the Congregation, and three of his friends from Verri&#x00E8;res: Mr Valenod, Mr de Moirod, and Mr de Cholin. "I can control these eight people," the priest said.</p>

	<p>The newspaper printed the names, and Mrs de R&#xEA;nal left Verri&#x00E8;res for Besan&#xE7;on. Mr de R&#x00EA;nal allowed her, as long as she never left her room. "I am now a liberal, and if you do anything it will cause me trouble," he said.</p>

	<p>When she arrived in Besan&#xE7;on she wrote a letter to every person on the jury, asking that they let Julien go free.</p>
