	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER TWELVE</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">T</span>hat night, Mr John Knightley's older brother, George Knightley, came for dinner. Mr Woodhouse was unhappy there was another dinner guest on Isabella's first night in Hartfield, but Emma thought it was proper to invite Mr Knightley. The last time Emma had spoken with Mr Knightley, they had quarreled about Emma's plans for Harriet. He was still upset that Emma had encouraged Harriet to refuse Mr Martin's marriage proposal.</p>

	<p>When Mr Knightley came to the house, Emma believed their quarreling was finished.</p>

	<p>"We think alike about our nephews and nieces, but our opinions on men and women are sometimes very different," Emma told her brother-in-law.</p>

	<p>"Perhaps if you stopped with your silly matchmaking, we might never disagree," he replied.</p>

	<p>"If we disagree, it must be because I am wrong."</p>

	<p>"Yes, that's true. Remember, I was sixteen years old when you were born."</p>

	<p>"Twenty-one years have passed since then. I think my understanding has improved since I was born."</p>

	<p>"Yes, however, I still have sixteen years' more experience than you, dear Emma."</p>

	<p>"That's true," agreed Emma, "but I want to know that Mr Martin is not very disappointed."</p>

	<p>"A man cannot be more disappointed," was his answer.</p>

	<p>"Indeed, I am very sorry for him. Now, let us be friends again."</p>

	<p>The rest of the evening was quiet and peaceful. The two Mr Knightleys talked together about business. Mr Woodhouse had a long talk with Isabella, and Emma occasionally joined one or the other conversation.</p>

	<p>"My poor Isabella," said Mr Woodhouse, "how long since you have come to Hartfield? You must be so tired after your long journey here. I was so upset that your family went to Southend instead of coming here last autumn. I think going to the sea can be dangerous."</p>

	<p>"Our doctor, Mr Wingfield, recommended that the children go, particularly for the little Bella's throat," replied Isabella.</p>

	<p>"My dear, but Doctor Perry believes the sea will not improve anyone's health. I am sure it almost killed me once."</p>

	<p>"Please, let's not talk about the sea now," cried Emma, "I envy you, Isabella. I have never seen the sea."</p>

	<p>"Mr Perry will come here tomorrow; you should let him look at little Bella's throat," suggested Mr Woodhouse.</p>

	<p>"Her throat is so much better since her visit to the sea, now there is no need to see a doctor," replied Isabella.</p>

	<p>"Now, I think your family is not looking well, perhaps Doctor Perry should check on you all."</p>

	<p>"Mr Wingfield takes great care of us. He said we are in excellent health. But, you do think Mr Knightley is looking ill?" asked Isabella.</p>

	<p>"He is, indeed, not looking well."</p>

	<p>"Isabella," exclaimed Mr John Knightley, "concern yourself with the children, let me look as I choose."</p>

	<p>"But still, Doctor Perry was surprised you decided to go to Southend, he thought it would be unhealthy for the children," interrupted Mr Woodhouse.</p>

	<p>"Mr Perry," said Mr John Knightley angrily, "should not speak his opinions unless they are asked for."</p>

	<p>Mr Woodhouse was quite troubled that Mr Knightley would speak so angrily about his dear friend, Mr Perry.</p>
