	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER THIRTY-THREE</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">A</span>fter speaking with Mrs Elton on several occasions, her opinion remained the same. She was not fond of Mr Elton's new wife. Since marrying, Mr Elton had changed quite a bit, as well. He became unfriendly, particularly with Miss Woodhouse; he entirely ignored poor Harriet Smith. Mrs Elton suggested on many occasions that she and Emma spend time together. Emma said nothing about meeting with her. This upset Mrs Elton, and she became quite cold to Emma. This only increased Emma's dislike for the woman. Mrs Elton and her new husband were rather impolite towards Harriet, as well.</p>

	<p>Mrs Elton, however, was quite fond of Jane Fairfax.</p>

	<p>"Jane Fairfax is absolutely charming, Miss Woodhouse. So ladylike, and she plays the pianoforte extremely well! But, the poor girl, she grew up with the Campbells in such a comfortable home, but she will soon have to leave all that to find work. She is a very delightful young woman!"</p>

	<p>"I have known Miss Fairfax for many years&#151;"</p>

	<p>Mrs Elton interrupted, "You and I, Miss Woodhouse, must make her stay here in Highbury as comfortable as possible. Then, the rest in town will do as we do. I shall invite her to my house often."</p>

	<p>"Poor Jane Fairfax!" thought Emma, "This is such a punishment, to become friends with Mrs Elton. Poor, poor girl."</p>

	<p>Within the next few days, Emma was surprised to see Jane Fairfax accept Mrs Elton's friendship. Emma heard of Jane going on walks with the Eltons, dining at the Eltons, spending a day with the Eltons. Emma was astonished!</p>

	<p>Jane had planned to come to Highbury for three months, while the Campbells were in Ireland with their daughter and her new husband, Mr Dixon. Three months had passed, but now another invitation to visit the Campbells came for her; the Campbells planned to stay longer for the visit in Ireland. Mrs Dixon had written the letter, asking her dear friend to come. Jane again refused the invitation. No one in Highbury could guess Jane's reason for refusing, although Emma believed Mr Dixon was her reason for remaining in Highbury.</p>

	<p>One evening, she was asking Mrs Weston and Mr Knightley why Jane Fairfax would befriend Mrs Elton, such an impolite, boring woman. Mrs Weston and Mr Knightley both knew of her dislike for Mrs Elton.</p>

	<p>"Jane spends every day with her aunt at home, and perhaps she gets bored with the same people, Emma," Mrs Weston told her.</p>

	<p>"You are right, Mrs Weston," said Mr Knightley, "she receives attention from Mrs Elton, which no one else gives her."</p>

	<p>Emma knew that Mr Knightley was telling her that she ignored Jane Fairfax.</p>

	<p>"My dear Mr Knightley, you admire Miss Fairfax with serious interest." Emma began.</p>

	<p>"Mr Cole noticed six weeks ago that I am interested in Jane Fairfax," he paused to sigh, "But that will never be. Miss Fairfax is not interested in me. She would not marry me if I asked her, and I am very sure I shall never ask her."</p>

	<p>Emma was pleased that her dear Mr Knightley was not considering marriage.</p>
