	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER SIXTEEN</p>

	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">Fix Does Not Seem to Understand What Is Said to Him</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">T</span>he Rangoon was an iron steamer, weighing about seventeen hundred and seventy tons. She was as fast as the Mongolia, but not as comfortable. Phineas Fogg wanted to make the trip nicer for Aouda, but the trip would only take ten to twelve days, and the young woman was not hard to please.</p>

	<p>During the first few days of the journey, Aouda got to know her protector. She constantly thanked Mr Fogg. The gentleman listened to her, but he never seemed warm. Aouda did not know what to think of him. Passepartout had told her about him, and he told her about the wager.</p>

	<p>Many of the Parsee merchants had made fortunes by trading cotton. One of them, Sir Jametsee Jeejeebhoy, was made a knight by the English Government. Aouda was a relative of this man. It was his cousin, Jeejeeh, whom she hoped to join at Hong Kong. She did not know if he would protect her, though. Mr Fogg tried to calm her.</p>

	<p>What was detective Fix doing all this while? He had managed to board the Rangoon at Calcutta without being seen by Passepartout. He left orders that, if the warrant should arrive, it should be sent to him at Hong Kong. It would be hard to explain to Passepartout why he was on board. It became necessary, though, for Fix to talk to the servant again.</p>

	<p>All the detective's hopes were on Hong Kong. The steamer's stay at Singapore would be too short. The arrest must be made at Hong Kong, or the robber would escape forever. Hong Kong was the last English ground Mr Fogg would visit.</p>

	<p>Fix decided that, if worst came to worst, he would tell Passepartout everything. He was certain Passepartout was not Fogg's partner. The servant would not want to become a criminal, and would help the detective. This method was dangerous, and could only be used when everything else failed. One word from Passepartout to his master would ruin everything.</p>

	<p>But who was this woman, Aouda? They had met in between Bombay and Calcutta, but where? Had they met accidentally, or had he searched for the beautiful woman? He decided he could create problems for Mr Fogg at Hong Kong, and the gentleman could not escape by using money.</p>

	<p>Could he wait till they reached Hong Kong? Fogg had a habit of jumping from one boat to another. He might be on his way to Yokohama before Fix could do anything. There was no time to lose, so Fix prepared to talk to Passepartout.</p>

	<p>It was now the 30th of October, and on the next day the Rangoon would be in Singapore.</p>

	<p>Fix went on deck, where Passepartout was walking. The detective looked surprised, and walked forward. "You here, on the Rangoon?"</p>

	<p>"What, Monsieur Fix, are you on board?" replied the really astonished Passepartout. "Why, I left you at Bombay, and here you are, on the way to Hong Kong! Are you going around the world, too?"</p>

	<p>"No, no," replied Fix. "I shall stop at Hong Kong&#151;at least for some days."</p>

	<p>"Hum!" said Passepartout, who seemed confused. "But how is it I have not seen you on board since we left Calcutta?"</p>

	<p>"Oh, I had a little seasickness. I've been staying in my room. And how is Mr Fogg?"</p>

	<p>"As well as ever, not a day behind time! But, Monsieur Fix, you don't know that we have a young lady with us."</p>

	<p>"A young lady?" replied the detective.</p>

	<p>Passepartout told Fix Aouda's history, the trouble at the Bombay temple, the purchase of the elephant, the rescue, the arrest, and the sentence of the Calcutta court. Passepartout was happy to tell the story.</p>

	<p>"But will your master bring this young woman to Europe?"</p>

	<p>"Not at all. We are placing her under the protection of one of her relatives, a rich merchant at Hong Kong."</p>

	<p>"Nothing to be done there," said Fix to himself. He hid his disappointment. "A glass of gin, Mr Passepartout?"</p>

	<p>"Yes, Monsieur Fix. We must have a friendly glass on board the Rangoon."</p>
