	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER SIX</p>

	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">The Lost Boys' New Mother</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">"I</span> have killed Wendy! Peter will be so pleased with me!" cried Tootles with a smile. But he stopped smiling when he went and saw Wendy's body.</p>

	<p>"This isn't a big bird!" cried Slightly in fear, "I think this is a lady!"</p>

	<p>"She must be what Peter wanted to bring us," said Nibs, "and we have killed her!"</p>

	<p>Just at this moment, Peter flew over to them and landed. The lost boys stared at him and became very scared.</p>

	<p>"Aren't you happy that I am back?" Peter asked.</p>

	<p>The boys were too scared to open their mouths.</p>

	<p>Peter laughed, "I have great news! I have found you all a mother!"</p>

	<p>The boys were still silent. Peter began to look troubled.</p>

	<p>"You should have seen her? She flew over this way."</p>

	<p>Finally, the boys turned around and pointed at Wendy's body on the ground. Peter did not say anything; he just stared at her body. Then he walked over to her and gently pulled the arrow out of her chest. He turned to the boys and his face became very angry.</p>

	<p>"Who shot this arrow?" he asked seriously.</p>

	<p>"I did," said Tootles.</p>

	<p>Peter then picked up a bow and put the arrow on it. Just as he was aiming the arrow at Tootles, Curly cried, "Wait! The lady is lifting her arm! She is alive!"</p>

	<p>Peter ran over to her and sat down. He realized that Tootles' arrow had hit the button necklace that Wendy was wearing around her neck. The button that Peter gave her had saved her life!</p>

	<p>"Listen," said Nibs, "Tinker Bell is crying!" he pointed to the fairy flying above them.</p>

	<p>"Tink told us to shoot the Wendy. She said that you wanted us to kill her," Tootles told Peter.</p>

	<p>Peter became angrier than he had ever been.</p>

	<p>"Leave!" he screamed at the fairy, "And don't come back here for a very long time!"</p>

	<p>The boys talked about what to do with Wendy while she was recovering.</p>

	<p>"Let's carry her into our secret house," suggested Slightly.</p>

	<p>"No!" replied Peter, "You must not touch a lady; that is not respectful."</p>

	<p>"But if she lies outside, she will certainly die!" cried Tootles.</p>

	<p>"We will have to build a house around her!" said Peter. He measured Wendy's body and decided how big the house should be. "Let's work boys! Get all the tools and strong wood that you can find!"</p>

	<p>Just then, John and Michael arrived. They were very tired from flying and they almost could not stand up, but Peter made them work also.</p>

	<p>"We must build a house for Wendy," he told them. "We are all her servants."</p>

	<p>"Her servants!" John cried, "But Wendy is just a girl!"</p>

	<p>Wendy suddenly began singing:</p>

<blockquote class="letter">

	<p>I wish I had a lovely house</p>

	<p>The smallest ever seen,</p>

	<p>With beautiful little red walls</p>

	<p>And roof of bright green.</p>

</blockquote>

	<p>The boys were all happy to hear her sing, because they had found red wood, and the ground was covered with green grass. They all sang to Wendy as they worked.</p>

<blockquote class="letter">

	<p>We'll build little walls and a roof</p>

	<p>And will make a lovely door,</p>

	<p>Please tell us, our mother Wendy,</p>

	<p>Do you want anything more?</p>

</blockquote>

	<p>Wendy sang her answer.</p>

<blockquote class="letter">

	<p>Oh, now I want to have</p>

	<p>Happy windows all around,</p>

	<p>With roses in the garden,</p>

	<p>And smiling babies warm inside.</p>

</blockquote>

	<p>The lost boys made windows by hitting their fists through the red wood, and they made covers for the windows using yellow leaves. But, sadly, there were no roses and babies and they had to pretend.</p>

	<p>When the house was finished, they could not see Wendy, because she was built inside.</p>

	<p>"If you want to see her you must first knock on the door," said Peter, "you must always be very polite to Wendy and act like gentlemen."</p>

	<p>The door did not have a knocker, so Tootles took off his shoe and hung it on the door. Wendy came to the door and the boys all took off their hats.</p>

	<p>"We've built this house to give you," Tootles told her.</p>

	<p>"It's beautiful!" Wendy smiled.</p>

	<p>All the boys then sat on one knee and held out their arms, begging, "Wendy lady, please will you be our mother!"</p>

	<p>"Do you really want me to?" she replied, "I'm just a little girl; I don't have any experience as a mother."</p>

	<p>"That's okay," Peter said, "You'll still make a wonderful mother."</p>

	<p>Wendy thought for a minute.</p>

	<p>"Okay," she said, "I will try my best. Now come inside and take off your shoes, you boys! Your feet must be wet and cold. Soon I will put you all to bed and I promise to tell you a story!"</p>
