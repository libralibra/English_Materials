	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER SEVEN</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">B</span>arton Park, where Sir and Lady Middleton lived, was about half a mile from the cottage. The ladies had passed near it upon arriving at the cottage. The house was large and handsome, and the Middletons lived in style, always with friends staying with them in the house to keep them company. Both Sir and Lady preferred to invite friends to stay with them. Sir Middleton enjoyed hunting with friends, while Lady Middleton delighted in caring for her children, but preferred to have other mothers and children around, as well.</p>

	<p>During their many dinner parties, Lady Middleton enjoyed showing off the elegance of her dinners. But Sir John's satisfaction in having such events was more real. He delighted in collecting more young people around him than his house would hold. The noisier the house, the happier was Sir John. The arrival of a new family in the area was always a matter of joy to him. He was charmed with the new neighbors in his cottage. The Miss Dashwoods were young, pretty and honest. Sir John could not be more delighted.</p>

	<p>The Dashwoods were invited for dinner the next evening at Barton Park. He repeated many times that he was sorry he could not bring any smart young men to meet them for dinner. There was, in fact, only one other gentleman present, aside from Sir John himself. This other man was a dear friend of Sir John's, Colonel Brandon, although he was certainly not charming and friendly like Sir John. Lady Middleton's mother was present, as well, who was quite a friendly, agreeable old woman.</p>

	<p>Mrs Jennings, Lady Middleton's mother, was a good-humored, merry, fat old woman, who talked a great deal, seemed very happy, and rather ill-mannered. She was full of jokes and laughter, and before dinner was over, she had said many things about lovers and husbands. She mentioned that she hoped the girls had not left their hearts at Norland, then laughed to herself. Marianne was quite worried about her sister, as she knew Elinor was still rather upset about leaving Edward to move to Barton cottage.</p>

	<p>Colonel Brandon, the friend of Sir John, was quiet and serious. His appearance, however, was not unpleasing. Although Marianne and Margaret believed him to be an old man, as he was nearly thirty-five, he looked sensible and gentleman-like.</p>

	<p>In the evening, Sir John requested that Marianne sing for the group, after he discovered that she was musical. Marianne sang quite well, and the group praised her after every song. Sir John was loud in congratulating her after each song, and as loud in his conversation with the others while every song lasted. Lady Middleton frequently requested him to quiet himself, wondering how anyone could not pay attention to the music for one moment, although she once asked Marianne to sing a particular song that Marianne had just finished. Colonel Brandon alone, of all the party, quietly and patiently listened to her play. Marianne respected him for his quiet attention, which the others did not give her.</p>
