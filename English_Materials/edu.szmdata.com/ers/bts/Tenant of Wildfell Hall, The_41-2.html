	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER FORTY-ONE</p>

	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">Hope Again</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">M</span>arch 20th&#151;Mr Huntingdon left in early February. Now, I am alone with my son, to teach him about morals and gentlemanly behaviour. It was quite difficult to break those terrible habits that his father taught him, but he has learned quickly. He now refuses to drink wine or any other liquor. At first, I gave him as much wine as he requested, but added a bit of medicine to make him feel ill. Now, he believes that if he drinks wine, he will soon be ill.</p>

	<p>My brother, Fredrick, is coming to Grassdale soon for a visit. After his arrival, I will explain my plans for escape, and ask for his help. I believe he will be quite willing to help me, as he hates my husband for his terrible behaviour as a husband and father, although he has found this information through others; I never told him a word of my marriage problems.</p>

	<p>April 16th&#151;He has come and gone. He stayed for only two weeks. The time passed quickly, but very, very happily. He is willing to assist me in my escape, but has persuaded me to stay at Grassdale until I cannot bear the situation any longer. He will prepare a few rooms in Wildfell Hall, where his family lived many years ago. If I need his help, I will write to him, and he will have the rooms ready for my arrival.</p>
