	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE</p>

	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">Discussion with a Master</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">W</span>hen Julien gave the new letter to Mrs de R&#x00EA;nal, she was very calm. "If this goes wrong I'll lose everything," she said. "Take this box of money and hide it in the mountains."</p>

	<p>This was the worst time in Mr de R&#x00EA;nal's life. He tried to guess who wrote the letter. Besides his wife, he only had ten friends. All of them envy me! He thought. Especially Mr Valenod! Can it be that I have no friends to ask for advice? Oh, Falcoz!</p>

	<p>Falcoz was his childhood friend, but he was not a noble. Ten years ago Falcoz started a newspaper, but the government took away his license. He asked his old friend for help, but Mr de R&#x00EA;nal refused. Now Mr de R&#x00EA;nal thought, I have money and power, but still I need him.</p>

	<p>What can I do? he thought. If I surprise them in bed, I can kill them both. The law is on my side, and I won't go to jail. Mr de R&#x00EA;nal looked at his knife, but the thought of blood frightened him.</p>

	<p>I can throw them out of my house, but then they'll go to Paris. She'll inherit her aunt's money and I'll look like a fool. All my friends in Verri&#x00E8;res will laugh! If only she were dead. No one would laugh at me then.</p>

	<p>Mrs de R&#x00EA;nal knew her plan had only one chance. She gave her husband the letter and said, "A man gave me this horrible letter today. I demand you send this Mr Sorel away right now."</p>

	<p>Mr de R&#x00EA;nal read the letter. This letter was also on blue paper, and Mr de R&#x00EA;nal was both tired and angry. "You must dismiss Julien," his wife said. "He's only a worker's son, and he'll find another job. Mr Valenod or Mr de Maugiron might hire him, for example."</p>

	<p>"You're very stupid!" Mr de R&#x00EA;nal yelled. "Women don't understand anything!" Mr de R&#x00EA;nal yelled for a long time, but Mrs de R&#x00EA;nal was calm. She was only thinking of Julien. She wanted him to be proud of her.</p>

	<p>"Send him away for a month. He can stay with his friend in the woods," she said. "I've never thought he was a good person since he refused to marry Elisa. He would get a fortune because she sometimes meets Mr Valenod secretly."</p>

	<p>This was surprising. "Ah!" said Mr de R&#x00EA;nal. "This is interesting."</p>

	<p>Mrs de R&#x00EA;nal continued, "Mr Valenod even sent me letters before."</p>

	<p>Now Mr de R&#x00EA;nal was even angrier. "Show me these letters! Where are they?"</p>

	<p>Mr de R&#x00EA;nal found the old letters and made a discovery. "These letters are on the same paper as the second anonymous letter!" He wanted to go and talk to Mr Valenod right away, but Mrs de R&#x00EA;nal calmed him down.</p>

	<p>"Many people in town envy you," she said. "If you start this new trouble they will laugh at you." Mr de R&#x00EA;nal agreed, so he decided not to talk to Mr Valenod or Elisa right away.</p>

	<p>At dinner Mr de R&#x00EA;nal said to Julien, "You may go to Verri&#x00E8;res for a week."</p>

	<p>When Mr de R&#x00EA;nal left, Mrs de R&#x00EA;nal told Julien what she had done. Mrs de R&#x00EA;nal still wanted to see him that night, but Julien thought it was not wise. "I think you don't care about me," she said.</p>

	<p>"I'm just worried. I will miss you very much," he replied.</p>
