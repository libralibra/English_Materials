	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER THIRTY-FOUR</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">E</span>veryone in Highbury who knew Mr Elton was inviting the new couple for dinner parties. Mrs Elton was determined to show this small town the meaning of high class. She announced many times that she would have a grand evening party, with more waiters, delicate dishes, and refreshments than the people of Highbury had seen before.</p>

	<p>Emma, meanwhile, felt she should have a dinner party for the Eltons, being the polite lady she was. She sent out invitations for the Westons, Mr Knightley, Jane Fairfax, and the Eltons. Harriet asked to decline the invitation. She was not yet ready to see the happy new couple together. Emma decided to pay closer attention to Miss Fairfax after her conversation with Mr Knightley.</p>

	<p>"Of the same age, and always knowing her, I should have been more her friend," Emma thought to herself.</p>

	<p>A few days before the dinner party, Mr George Knightley's younger brother, John Knightley, decided he would come to Hartfield for a visit with two of his children. This news upset Mr Woodhouse a bit, as eight people at dinner together was the most he could bear; he thought the noise would be too much. Fortunately, Mr Weston had to go into town on business, so he did not attend the dinner, but would come later in the evening. Mr Woodhouse was quite at ease, now there would be a dinner party of eight.</p>

	<p>The event was favourable to Mr Woodhouse. While the party was waiting for dinner to be arranged, Mr John Knightley spoke with Miss Fairfax. He had seen her that morning while she was walking to the post office.</p>

	<p>"I hope you did not walk far, Miss Fairfax; it was raining, or I am sure you will soon be ill." he told her.</p>

	<p>"I reached home before the rain was too much. A walk before breakfast does me good."</p>

	<p>Mrs Elton soon joined them.</p>

	<p>"My dear Jane, you sad girl, how could you go to the post office in the rain? I was not there to take care of you!" Mrs Elton declared.</p>

	<p>Jane patiently told her that she had not caught a cold.</p>

	<p>"You really are a very sad girl, and do not know how to take care of yourself. You shall not do such a thing again! I will have my driver offered any time you need to leave your home. Say no more about it."</p>

	<p>"You are extremely kind," said Jane, "but the doctor has advised me to take walks everyday. I love my early morning walks."</p>

	<p>"You must accept my offer!" Mrs Elton insisted.</p>

	<p>Jane did not know how to answer, so she began to speak again to Mr John Knightley.</p>
