	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER THIRTY-FOUR</p>

	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">Hiding the Secret</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">E</span>vening. I was calm throughout the day, but worry how I will bear the next ten or twelve days before our guests' departure. When they are gone, how shall I bear the next months or years of my future life with that man&#151;my greatest enemy. No one could hurt me the way he has. I loved him so foolishly, and trusted him completely! I no longer love my husband&#151;I HATE him! And, I believe he will never feel guilty for the pain he has caused me.</p>

	<p>Mr Hargrave has annoyed me all day long with his extreme politeness. I do not trust that man, although his kindness may be true. He seems to want to speak to me alone, but I do not wish to speak to him nor anyone else about the terrible news about my husband.</p>

	<p>Earlier today, while the gentlemen were out hunting, I was in the sitting room with the other ladies. Lady Lowborough was quite talkative, and wanted to have a conversation with me. I want never to speak to that woman again. I sat nearby reading a book, and finally, could not bear her speaking to me. Soon enough, I wrote her a short message on a page in my book. And passed it to her.</p>

	<p>"I know your behaviour quite well, and know that there is no real friendship between us. I must ask that you never speak to me as you would to a friend, as I am not your friend."</p>

	<p>As she read, she became silent, looking quite embarrassed. She then stood up and came to me, speaking in a whisper.</p>

	<p>"Helen, please let me speak to you for a moment."</p>

	<p>I informed her that I knew of her love affair with my husband. She was silent for some time.</p>

	<p>"Will you tell Lord Lowborough?" she asked me, looking quite worried.</p>

	<p>"What if I do?"</p>

	<p>"Well, I hope you do not tell him, and would be thankful to you if you did not tell him."</p>

	<p>"I shall not tell him, but only because I do not want to upset your dear husband. I hope you will realise how selfish you are, and soon regret what you have done," I paused. "And now, Lady Lowborough, I hope you will leave this house immediately&#151;"</p>

	<p>"Yes, yes, of course," she said, interrupting me, "But Helen, I cannot go early. I have no reason to leave early, all the guests would have suspicions about my early departure. Please allow me to stay until the other guests leave, as well. Only a week longer. I will not annoy you anymore."</p>

	<p>"Well! I have nothing more to say to you!"</p>

	<p>"Have you mentioned this affair to Huntingdon?" she asked as I was leaving the room.</p>

	<p>"Do not mention his name to me!" was my answer to her.</p>

	<p>I have not spoken to Lady Lowborough since that evening.</p>
