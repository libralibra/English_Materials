	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER THIRTY-TWO</p>

	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">Sorry Problems</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">E</span>veryone in the church ran out quickly. Julien felt a hand on his neck. It was a police officer. They took him to the prison. "It's all over," Julien said. "In two weeks I'll go to the guillotine."</p>

	<p>Mrs de R&#x00EA;nal was not going to die. She was only hit in the shoulder, but she wanted to die. She wanted Julien to kill her. She gave some money to Elisa, her maid. "Take this to the prison guard. I want him to treat Julien well."</p>

	<p>A judge came to the prison. Julien said, "I killed her, and I planned to kill her. The law says I must die, and I am ready for it."</p>

	<p>There is only one thing left, Julien thought. I must write to Mathilde.</p>

	<blockquote class="letter">

	<p>I have taken my revenge. I'm sorry everyone will talk about me. You should never talk about me, even to my son.</p>

	<p>One year after I die, you must marry Marquis de Croisenois. Don't write to me; I won't answer.</p>

	</blockquote>

	<p>After writing the letter, Julien became deeply unhappy. While he was thinking, the guard came to talk to him. "You know," the guard said, "she isn't dead. Mrs de R&#x00EA;nal is getting better."</p>

	<p>For the first time, Julien believed in God. He was truly sorry for what he had done. This woman had taken away all of his happiness, but he didn't hate her. She will live! He thought. She will live to forgive and love me.</p>
