	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">T</span>he next morning, Emma heard that Frank Churchill had returned to London for a hair cut, which seemed rather strange, but Emma still had a very good opinion about Mr Churchill. Other than this strange behavior, she was quite pleased with his visit. However, Mr George Knightley's attitudes towards Mr Churchill were not as kind. Emma heard him say to himself, "I knew he was just a foolish young man," after everyone found out about Mr Churchill's short departure for nothing but a haircut.</p>

	<p>That day, it was announced that the Woodhouses' neighbours, the Coles, were having a dinner party soon. Emma decided she would not attend the party, although she had not received an invitation, which she thought rather strange. Her father never dined outside their home, which was well-known in Highbury; therefore, Emma would certainly refuse the invitation. The Coles had lived in Highbury for ten years, and were very good people, but not a family of high class or fortune. Emma believed it was quite impolite that they would not send an invitation, as the Woodhouses are of high society, and should have the opportunity to refuse the invitation. Mrs Weston reasoned that, "The Coles know you do not dine out," but Emma felt she should have the power to refuse. The Westons, Mr George Knightley, Harriet, the Bates' and Frank Churchill would all attend the dinner party, all the highest of Highbury society. Emma was now tempted to accept an invitation, although one had not been offered.</p>

	<p>Very soon, an invitation did arrive at the Woodhouse home. Mr Woodhouse remarked, "Of course it must be declined," but Emma told her father she would like to go, to show respect to the family. The letter would have arrived sooner, but the Coles were waiting for the arrival of a folding screen, which they had to keep Mr Woodhouse warm. However, Emma did not wish him to go to the party. Mr Woodhouse often gets upset at large parties, so Emma thought he should stay at home.</p>

	<p>"Well, my dear, you should return home at an early hour, you will get very tired," suggested Mr Woodhouse.</p>

	<p>"But you would not wish me to leave before I am tired, Papa?"</p>

	<p>"Oh no, my love, but you will soon be tired. You will not like the noise of the party."</p>

	<p>"But, dear Mr Woodhouse," interrupted Mr Weston, "if Emma leaves early, the party will end."</p>

	<p>"The sooner the party ends the better," said Mr Woodhouse.</p>

	<p>"But this may upset the Coles. They are good people, I know you do not wish to disappoint them," Mr Weston explained.</p>

	<p>"No, I do not want to hurt the Coles. Perhaps, Emma, you can stay at the party a little longer than you wish."</p>

	<p>"Oh yes, Papa. I have no fears at all of staying late."</p>
