	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER THIRTY-ONE</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">E</span>mma continued to think about her being in love, although she could not decide how much in love she was. She thought about his next return, believing that he would tell her he loved her, but she decided she must refuse him. She could never leave her father.</p>

	<p>She thought to herself, "he is very much in love with me, I know, but I must not encourage this love."</p>

	<p>Soon enough, his letter to Mrs Weston arrived. He mentioned "Miss Woodhouse" more than once in the letter. He added, "I had not spoken to Emma's beautiful little friend, please excuse my impoliteness." This, Emma thought, was a message to her; Harriet was only mentioned as being her friend. But, could he be interested in Harriet, not her? No, impossible.</p>

	<p>Soon, Harriet came for a visit. Emma knew that with Mr Churchill gone, Harriet would again think of Mr Elton; she was still so in love with him. Emma, however, did not want to remember. She still felt guilty about convincing Harriet to fall in love with Mr Elton. When Harriet began to speak of Mr Elton, Emma began speaking with anger:</p>

	<p>"Harriet, when you speak so unhappily of Mr Elton's marriage, you remind me of the guilt I feel. It is painful for me to remember. Do you want me to feel pain?"</p>

	<p>"Oh, no! You are my best friend. Oh, Miss Woodhouse, I did not mean to hurt you! I have been so selfish, please forgive me!"</p>

	<p>Emma was pleased. There was no more talk of Mr Elton.</p>
