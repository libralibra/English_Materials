	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER THREE</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">M</span>rs Dashwood remained at Norland for several months with her three daughters. Although she loved her home dearly, she was anxious to leave, as Mrs John Dashwood was quite disagreeable to her. The mother and three daughters decided that they must find a home near Norland, as leaving it would be unthinkable. They had looked at several homes nearby, but Elinor had rejected them, as they were too expensive for their small income.</p>

	<p>Before his death, Mrs Dashwood's husband had informed her of his son's promise to take care of her and her three daughters. She trusted that his promise was true, and was content that her daughters would not have to worry about income. She felt guilty for previously not trusting him to be a generous individual, but now believed he would, indeed, help them.</p>

	<p>Mrs Dashwood had never liked the younger Mrs John Dashwood, and never trusted the young woman. Since the young couple and their child had moved into Norland, the mother's feelings towards her daughter-in-law had become worse. Mrs Dashwood wished to leave Norland after a short time, but Elinor explained that they first must find a suitable home. During their time at Norland, Elinor became quite close to the brother of Mrs John Dashwood, Edward Ferrars, a pleasing young man, who often came for visits after Mrs John Dashwood and her husband moved to Norland.</p>

	<p>Some mothers might encourage their child to marry for wealth or for fame, but Mrs Dashwood believed Edward Ferrars to be friendly, and in love with her daughter. Therefore, Mrs Dashwood was quite content that her daughter begin a relationship with the agreeable young man, who was also quite wealthy.</p>

	<p>Edward Ferrars was not handsome or talkative, but was honest, with an open heart. His mother and sister wished for him to gain a respected position in the government, but young Edward had no desire for fame or to improve his position in society. Edward Ferrars wished for only a quiet, comfortable life. Fortunately, he had a younger brother, Robert, who was more interested in fame.</p>

	<p>Edward had been staying several weeks at Norland before Mrs Dashwood knew him well, but Elinor suggested that their mother speak with him more often. Mrs Dashwood then made several efforts to know Edward Ferrars, and she was soon quite fond of the young man. She believed, as well, the young man was in love with her oldest daughter, and expected them to marry soon.</p>

	<p>"In a few months, my dear Marianne," said she, "Elinor will be married. We shall miss her, but she will be happy." "Oh Mama! How shall we live without her?"</p>

	<p>"My dear, it will hardly be a separation. We shall live close, and shall meet every day. You will gain a brother&#151;a real, caring brother. Edward is a wonderful man. But you look worried, Marianne. Do you disapprove of him?"</p>

	<p>"Perhaps," said Marianne, "I am surprised at my sister's choice. Edward is friendly and I love him, but he is not handsome or charming. Besides, he has no real talents. He does not know music, and though he appreciates Elinor's drawings very much, he knows nothing about drawing himself. He appreciates her drawings as a lover would, not as an artist. I could not be happy with such a man. He should have the same interests as I; the same books, the same music must charm us both. Oh Mama! How untalented Edward is! However, Elinor does not have my feelings, and therefore, she might be happy with him."</p>

	<p>"Remember, my love, that you are not yet seventeen. It is still too early for you to worry about not finding love."</p>
