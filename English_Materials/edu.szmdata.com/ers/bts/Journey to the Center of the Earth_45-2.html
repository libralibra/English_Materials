	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER FORTY-FIVE</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">H</span>ere is the conclusion of a story that many people have refused to believe. The Stromboli fishermen were kind, giving us food and clothing. After waiting forty-eight hours, we were taken to another town, where we rested for a few days.</p>

	<p>On Friday, September 4, we took a ship to Marseilles, France, and finally arrived in Hamburg on September 9. Martha was surprised and Grauben was overjoyed.</p>

	<p>"Now that you're a hero, Axel," my fianc√©e said to me, "you'll never have to leave me again."</p>

	<p>I looked at her. She smiled with tears in her eyes.</p>

	<p>Martha had told everyone in town where my uncle and I had planned to go. When we returned to Hamburg, the news of our journey had spread all over the world. People had refused to believe it, and when they saw him again they still didn't believe it.</p>

	<p>But Hans was with us, as well. And with various pieces of news from Iceland, people began to believe our story. My uncle then became a great man, and I was the great man's nephew, and the city of Hamburg gave us a great celebration. He explained the story of our journey, and how we had discovered the path, thanks to the courageous Arne Saknussemm.</p>

	<p>Other scientists became quite envious of my uncle's success. Hans soon left Hamburg, as he missed his beloved Iceland dearly. We were quite upset when he left, as the three of us had become quite close. He had saved our lives many times during our journey, and we will never forget him. I'm sure I will see him again before my death.</p>

	<p>"<i>Farval</i>," he said one day, and soon left for Reykjavik, where he arrived safely.</p>

	<p>"Farewell, Hans."</p>

	<p>Journey to the Center of the Earth was popular all over the world, and was translated into hundreds of languages.</p>

	<p>Although my uncle was now famous, he was still upset about something during our trip. He still could not explain the directional instrument's problem during the last part of the trip. One day, I was in his study, and I noticed the famous instrument, and began observing it. It had been there for six quiet months. Suddenly, I figured out the reason for its problem.</p>

	<p>"What's the matter?" my uncle asked.</p>

	<p>"Look, its needle is pointing south instead of north! After we arrived at Cape Saknussemm, the needle switched positions."</p>

	<p>"Then that explains our mistake. Yes, tell me, my boy!"</p>

	<p>"During the storm on the Lidenbrock Sea, the lightening hit the raft and magnetized the metal, and reversed the direction of the instrument."</p>

	<p>"Ah!" my uncle exclaimed, laughing. "So it was a trick that electricity played!"</p>

	<p>From then on, my uncle was the happiest scientist on earth. And I was the happiest of men, because my lovely Grauben agreed to marry me, and we lived together with my uncle and dear Martha in the same house. My uncle, Professor Otto Lidenbrock, became an expert on Earth studies, and was asked to speak all over the world.</p>
