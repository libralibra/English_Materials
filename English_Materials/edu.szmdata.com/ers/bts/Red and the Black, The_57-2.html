	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">Frightening Her</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">J</span>ulien ran down to Mathilde. The only word she said to him was, "Promises!"</p>

	<p>I must not speak to her, he thought. I can still lose everything. When he returned home, he calmed down. He compared himself to a general who has half won a battle. I have an advantage, he thought, but what will I do tomorrow? As he thought about this, he read from a book by Napoleon. This heart is very different from Mrs de R&#x00EA;nal's, he thought.</p>

	<p>Frighten her! He thought suddenly. The enemy will obey me as long as she is afraid! She must doubt my love for her.</p>

	<p>He knew she would go to the library at eight o'clock, so he didn't arrive until nine. He burned with love, but his mind was in control.</p>

	<p>"Dishonor me," she said plainly. "We'll go to London. I'll be dishonored. That will be my promise to you."</p>

	<p>Julien was surprised. He replied, "And after you're dishonored, will you still love me in a week? I'm not a monster. I don't want to see you dishonored." If she would love me for a week, he thought, I'd die of happiness!</p>

	<p>"I'm not worthy of you," she said.</p>

	<p>Julien kissed her. Immediately he pulled away.</p>

	<p>That day and the following days he hid his love, but he became surer of her love.</p>
