	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">Annoyances</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">N</span>ineteenth&#151;Lady Lowborough was quite pleased to find that I would not tell her husband of her love affair with my husband. As the guests' departure quickly arrives, she becomes more fearless in her behaviour towards my husband.</p>

	<p>The last day of her stay at Grassdale, she came to me, with a proud smile, obviously wanting to anger me with some hurtful news.</p>

	<p>"You know, Mrs Huntingdon, you should thank me," she paused to look at me, "shall I tell you why you should thank me?"</p>

	<p>"I shall be glad to hear of anything you have assisted me in."</p>

	<p>"Well," she continued, "you have, of course, noticed the change in Mr Huntingdon's behaviour, as he has become quite a polite gentleman recently. I know you tried to change him, but failed. I told him, in a few words, that I could not bear to see him embarrass himself, and that he should take less wine, and begin acting like a gentleman. So, he did change his behaviour; and you should thank me for it."</p>

	<p>I stood up and left the room.</p>

	<p>"But I do not ask for your thanks," she continued, "I only hope that you will take care of him when I am gone, and do not ignore him, or he will return to his bad drinking habits again."</p>

	<p>I was silent with anger. They are all going tomorrow; I am quite thankful.</p>
