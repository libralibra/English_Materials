	<p class="storyTitle">BOOK TWO</p>

	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER ONE</p>

	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">Pleasures of the Countryside</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">W</span>hile Julien was waiting in the coach to Paris, he heard two men talking.</p>

	<p>"Oh! It's my old friend Falcoz!" said one man.</p>

	<p>"My friend Saint-Giraud! I thought you were living in a small town in Franche-Comt&#xE9;?" said Falcoz.</p>

	<p>"Living? No, I'm running away!" he replied. "I love the fresh air and the trees. I hate politics, though, and politics is driving me out."</p>

	<p>"Which party do you support?" Falcoz asked his friend.</p>

	<p>"None, and that's my problem. I was tired of the constant role-playing in Paris, so I left for the country. The local priest and some rich landowners asked me to dinner. I told them I don't care about politics, and I don't read any newspapers. The priest was very angry.</p>

	<p>"I wanted to give money to the poor, but he wanted me to give money to the Congregation, the Jesuit group. I refused, and I had all kinds of problems. The priest said I was ungodly, and someone poisoned all the fish in my pond. The judge, who was a good man but afraid of the priest, always judged against me.</p>

	<p>"To get some support, I decided to join the liberals. They would not leave me alone, though. I wouldn't vote for their horrible choice in the election, so they hated me, too.</p>

	<p>"It's over," he continued. "I sold the house, and I'm going to lose a lot of money. I am going to the only peaceful place: an apartment in Paris."</p>

	<p>"None of this would have happened to you under Napoleon," Falcoz said angrily.</p>

	<p>"All of my sufferings come from your Napoleon," Saint-Giraud replied. "Napoleon was only great in battle. He brought back the church, and he made them too powerful. He brought back the nobles, and now everyone wants to be a noble. It was the church and the small town nobles that forced me to be a liberal."</p>

	<p>The conversation was long, and Julien asked about Mr de R&#x00EA;nal. Saint-Giraud laughed. "So you know Verri&#x00E8;res? Your Mr de R&#x00EA;nal will soon be forced out by Mr Valenod," he said.</p>

	<p>"Napoleon gave people like Mr de R&#x00EA;nal and Father Ch&#xE9;lan power, and after them people like Mr Valenod and Father Maslon."</p>

	<p>Julien did not think much about Paris when he first saw it. He was still thinking about the last twenty-four hours he spent with his lover. He promised he would never forget Mrs de R&#x00EA;nal's children. He would help them if the church caused so much trouble that there was another revolution. If there was another revolution, the nobles would be in trouble.</p>

	<p>Julien was not excited to see much of Paris. He only cared to see what his hero Napoleon left behind. He met Father Pirard, and the priest told him about his new life in the house of Marquis de la Mole. "You will wear a black suit," he said, "but not like a priest. You will write his letters for him. You will not be paid much, but your salary can increase.</p>

	<p>"The marquis has a daughter and a son. The son is Count Norbert. Marquis de la Mole wants you to be friends, but I don't know why. You must be careful. Do not allow him to make fun of you. He will probably hate you because your family is poor.</p>

	<p>"The marquis' wife, Marquise de la Mole, is a very proud woman. She only cares about real nobility. Her family goes back to the Crusades, when the Catholic Church tried to invade the Holy Land. Never talk bad about any king, even Henry VIII. They were kings, and she thinks that is more important than anything. She will see you as a religious servant.</p>

	<p>"If this business does not work out, then come see to me. If we are still friends, you can be my assistant at my new church. If we are not, you should go to a different school."</p>

	<p>Julien thanked his good friend, and they took a coach to Marquis de la Mole's home.</p>

	<p>They arrived at the marquis' home. There was a large sign that said Hotel de la Mole. Julien said, "These people are so afraid of Jacobins and another revolution, but they still tell everyone where their house is!"</p>

	<p>Father Pirard nervously said, "I don't think you will last very long here."</p>
