	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER FORTY-NINE</p>

	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">Waiting</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">I</span> continued to visit Mr Lawrence. We seldom talked about Mrs Huntingdon, although I always mentioned her, hoping that he would have some news about my dear Helen. Lately, Mr Huntingdon's health has worsened, as he continues to drink great amounts of wine, so his health suffers, although, he fears death more often.</p>

	<p>Mr and Mrs Hattersley came for a visit. All of Mr Huntingdon's other friends have stopped speaking to him. Mr Hattersley greatly regrets his past ungentlemanly behaviour. He has since become an excellent husband and father, attending to their business affairs and children with great love. Milicent is delighted with her husband's change. Soon after the Hattersleys arrived, Mr Huntingdon's health became much worse. He remarked that the great pain he felt was gone. Mrs Huntingdon was alarmed; the doctor informed her that if the pain was gone, he would soon die. Mr Huntingdon became more anxious at the thought of his death.</p>

	<p>On December fifth, Mr Huntingdon died. His wife stayed with him all through the night.</p>

	<p>"Pray for me, Helen!" he said before he died.</p>
