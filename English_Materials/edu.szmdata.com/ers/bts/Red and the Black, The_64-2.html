	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER THIRTY-FOUR</p>

	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">A Powerful Man</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">T</span>he next morning Julien woke up very early and saw a peasant woman. When she threw herself into his arms, Julien realized it was Mathilde. "You beast!" she said. "Until I got to Verri&#x00E8;res, I didn't know about your crime. It was noble revenge, and it shows you have a good heart."</p>

	<p>"I had planned your future," Julien said. "After I died, you would marry Marquis de Croisenois. He would accept a widow. If people hear that you came to Besan&#xE7;on, it will hurt Marquis de la Mole."</p>

	<p>"I came using my maid's passport. People won't know it's me.</p>

	<p>She studied Julien. In her eyes he was Boniface de la Mole, but even more heroic.</p>

	<p>Mathilde did not want people to notice her, but the whole town did. After a week of waiting, she managed to meet Vicar-general de Frilair. She was very afraid, but when she met the vicar-general she became calm. This man was not so evil; he might be someone from Paris.</p>

	<p>Mathilde admitted her real name. "I want you to help me free Mr de la Vernaye."</p>

	<p>The vicar-general was surprised. Mathilde showed him Julien's army papers. "My father gave him this name after we married in secret."</p>

	<p>The priest's face changed slowly from a friendly one to an ambitious one. He knew Mathilde was friends with Mrs de Fervaques. Perhaps he could become a bishop. "If thirty-six people were chosen for a jury, I would have at least ten friends. I'm sure I could have him found not guilty."</p>

	<p>Then the priest told her what everyone in Besan&#xE7;on knew: Julien and Mrs de R&#x00EA;nal were lovers. "It could be that jealousy caused this crime," he said. "She had been seeing a priest from Dijon, a Jansenist. He is without morals, like all of them. Why else would he choose to shoot her in the church?"</p>

	<p>These words hurt Mathilde. I have control of this beautiful woman now, the priest thought.</p>
