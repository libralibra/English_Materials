	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER THIRTY-EIGHT</p>

	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">The Injured Man</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">D</span>ecember 20th, 1826&#151;The fifth anniversary of my wedding day, and I believe, the last year that I will spend in this house. I plan to escape with my son, as I cannot allow him to grow up with his father's frightening habits.</p>

	<p>In September, quiet Grassdale was again lively with the usual autumn guests. On the day of Lady Lowborough's arrival, I followed her into her room, and explained that if she continued her criminal love affair with my husband, I would immediately inform her husband. She was quite surprised at what I told her, but promised that their relationship was no more.</p>

	<p>I feared that I would have to inform poor Lord Lowborough of the terrible situation, and so hoped that Annabella and my husband had finished their affair. But, one evening, two weeks after the guests had arrived, I had no more reason to fear; Lord Lowborough discovered the news himself. I had gone into the library that night to be alone when Lord Lowborough came in quickly and closed the door, looking angry and hurt. He soon noticed that I was in the room, as well.</p>

	<p>"Mrs Huntingdon, I must leave you tomorrow."</p>

	<p>"Tomorrow! So, you have discovered it, too," I answered.</p>

	<p>"You know, then&#151;and you are so calm!" he said, looking at me in surprise. "How long have you known?"</p>

	<p>I felt guilty.</p>

	<p>"Two years," I said quietly.</p>

	<p>"Then why did you not tell me? You have injured me, as well!"</p>

	<p>"Perhaps I should have told you, but I did not want to hurt you. Since you both have arrived, I believed that they had ended their affair. Your wife promised me the relationship was finished."</p>

	<p>He was silent for a moment, but then spoke: "You too have suffered, I suppose."</p>

	<p>"I suffered much, at first."</p>

	<p>"Mrs Huntingdon, I have noticed that your appearance has changed since you were first married. You cannot be happy, but how can you stay so calm about such terrible news?"</p>

	<p>"I have learned to be calm, and you will, as well."</p>

	<p>As I walked into the sitting room, I looked at Lady Lowborough, attempting to look calm. She soon began to sing and play for the other guests, declaring that she must entertain the guests before her departure with her husband the next morning.</p>

	<p>They departed early in the morning before anyone else was awake, except Mr Huntingdon and myself.</p>

	<p>"You're leaving already, Lowborough?" my husband said to him with a smile.</p>

	<p>As Lord Lowborough was walking out the door, Mr Huntingdon loudly shouted, "Give my love to Annabella! I wish you both a happy journey," then walked off, laughing to himself. He mentioned later that day that he was much happier with his mistress gone, as she was becoming an annoyance.</p>

	<p>I know nothing more of Lord Lowborough's life, except from what Milicent tells me. Although, poor Milicent does not know that Lord and Lady Lowborough have separated. She lives in London, amusing herself with lovers and parties. He lives with their two children alone. Unfortunately, Lady Lowborough never loved her children, and never visits.</p>

	<p>A few days after Lord and Lady Lowborough departed, the other ladies left, as well. The gentlemen, however, stayed longer at Grassdale, although I did not spend much time with them.</p>
