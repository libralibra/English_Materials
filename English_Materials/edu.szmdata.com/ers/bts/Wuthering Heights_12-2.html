	<p class="storyTitle">BOOK THREE: THE SECOND CATHERINE</p>

	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER ONE</p>

	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">Heathcliff's Son</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">T</span>welve years passed. These years were happy ones for Ellen Dean.</p>

	<p>The second Catherine, Edgar's daughter, was very beautiful and looked like her dead mother. However, she was not like Cathy Linton in other ways.</p>

	<p>Little Cathy did not go outside the limits of Thrushcross Grange by herself. Sometimes, Edgar took her for a walk, but he would not let her go out with anyone else. Sometimes, she would stand at one of the windows and ask Ellen, "How long will it be before I can walk to the top of those hills, Ellen? Can I go there when I am a woman?"</p>

	<p>"Perhaps, Miss Cathy," Ellen always answered, "but your father will tell you that."</p>

	<p>When little Cathy was thirteen, Edgar Linton got a letter from Isabella. She told him that she had been sick for a long time, and she knew she did not have very long to live. Isabella asked Edgar to take care of her son, Linton.</p>

	<p>When Edgar read this sad letter, he went to Isabella at once. He was gone for three weeks, and during this time young Cathy walked around the gardens. Often Cathy rode her little horse for many hours. But one day in July she did not come back at her usual time. Ellen was worried and finally went to look for her. She walked until she could see Wuthering Heights, but she still could not find Cathy. She ran up to the house and knocked on the door.</p>

	<p>A servant came to the door. "Oh," she said, "You're looking for the young girl, aren't you! She's here, so don't worry. Mr Heathcliff is out somewhere with Joseph."</p>

	<p>Ellen found Cathy sitting in a little chair that had once been her mother's. She was laughing and talking to Hareton, who was now eighteen years old. Hareton was looking at Cathy as if she were a beautiful princess. He had never met anyone like her before.</p>

	<p>Ellen was happy to see Cathy and Hareton together, but she knew she had to act angry. "Catherine Linton, you naughty girl! Why did you stay out for so long, without telling me?"</p>

	<p>Cathy jumped up and ran to her. "Oh, Ellen," she laughed, "You've found me! Have you ever been to this house before?"</p>

	<p>Ellen didn't want to answer that! "Come home with me right now!" she said. She was afraid that Heathcliff would suddenly come home. But Cathy started to dance around the room.</p>

	<p>Hareton and the servant laughed.</p>

	<p>"Miss Cathy," said Ellen very seriously, "if you knew whose house this is, you'd run away as fast as you could!"</p>

	<p>Young Cathy turned to Hareton. "This is your father's house, isn't it?" she asked.</p>

	<p>Hareton's face turned red. "No," he said. He did not look at anyone.</p>

	<p>"Whose house is this, then? Is it your master's?"</p>

	<p>Hareton looked upset, and turned away from Cathy.</p>

	<p>"Oh! I thought you were the owner's son," said Cathy. "You should have told me you were only a servant! Now get me my horse."</p>

	<p>"Get it yourself! I'm not your slave!" the boy said. He added, "You little witch!" Ellen had to stop herself from laughing.</p>

	<p>"How dare you speak to me like that!" Cathy cried. "I'll tell my father!" She turned to the woman. "You get my horse," she said.</p>

	<p>"It's not my job to do what you say!" said the woman. "And be careful what you say to Mr Hareton! He may not be the master's son, but he's your cousin, young lady!"</p>

	<p>Cathy laughed. "He's not my cousin. Don't let her say these things, Ellen! Father's gone to get my cousin from London&#151;he's a gentlemen's son!"</p>

	<p>"Miss Cathy," Ellen whispered, "people can have many cousins."</p>

	<p>Cathy looked like she did not understand. "But Ellen&#151;he's not my cousin! We don't know him!" Then she ran out the door.</p>

	<p>Hareton seemed upset, but he went and found Cathy's little horse and brought it to the door.</p>

	<p>On the way home, Ellen tried to tell Cathy some of the truth. She told Cathy that her father Edgar did not like the people at Wuthering Heights, and he would be very upset to find out that Cathy had been there. Ellen and Cathy decided not to tell him about Cathy's adventure.</p>

	<p>When they got back to Thrushcross Grange, there was a letter waiting for them. It was from Edgar, and they learned that Isabella was dead. Edgar told Ellen to find a room for Linton, Cathy's young cousin.</p>

	<p>Cathy was very happy that her father was coming back. She was also excited to meet her cousin Linton.</p>

	<p>It was night when Edgar and Linton arrived home. Cathy ran out of the house and threw her arms around her father. When Ellen saw young Linton, she thought to herself, "Why, this boy could be Edgar's son! He looks so much like his uncle!"</p>

	<p>After they all had tea, Ellen took Linton upstairs to his room and waited until he was asleep. Then she went downstairs again. She was lighting a candle for Mr Edgar's bedroom when a maid told her that Mr Heathcliff's servant Joseph was at the door.</p>

	<p>"Joseph wants to speak to Mr Edgar!" said the maid.</p>

	<p>Ellen had a feeling that she knew the reason why. She was terribly worried. "I don't think the master can see him now," she said. "I'll speak to him."</p>

	<p>Joseph walked into the hall as she spoke. "I want to see Edgar Linton!" he said.</p>

	<p>"He's going to bed now," answered Ellen.</p>

	<p>Joseph did not listen to her. "Where is his room?" he asked.</p>

	<p>Ellen told him to wait and went to the library to tell Edgar that Joseph was there. But Joseph was behind Ellen in the hall, and went into the room. When he saw Edgar sitting in front of the fire, he said in a loud, angry voice, "Heathcliff has sent me to bring his son to Wuthering Heights, and says that I can't go back without him."</p>
