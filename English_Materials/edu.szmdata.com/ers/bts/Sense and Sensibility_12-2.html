	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER TWELVE</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">A</span>s Elinor and Marianne were walking together the next morning, Marianne announced that Willoughby had given her a horse as a gift that would soon be delivered. Without considering that their cottage has no place to keep a horse, Marianne had accepted the gift.</p>

	<p>"He intends for his servant to bring the horse immediately from Somersetshire, his home," she added, "and when it arrives, we will ride every day."</p>

	<p>Marianne was quite unwilling to understand that accepting such a gift was not possible for their small income. This was too much. Soon after, however, Elinor persuaded her sister to decline Willoughby's generous offer.</p>

	<p>That same day, Willoughby arrived for a visit, during which Marianne sadly told him she could not accept his gift.</p>

	<p>"But, Marianne, the horse is still yours. I will keep it until you leave the cottage to find your own home."</p>

	<p>After hearing such a tender, honest response, Elinor realized that Willoughby and her sister had quite a serious relationship. He had called her by her first name, only used by close friends and family, or a lover.</p>

	<p>The next day, Margaret came to Elinor with more news of Marianne's close relationship with Willoughby.</p>

	<p>"Oh! Elinor," cried Margaret, "I have such a secret to tell you about Marianne," she told her sister with a cheerful smile. "I know Marianne will marry Willoughby soon; I saw him cut off a piece of her hair to keep for himself."</p>

	<p>Such an act as cutting off a lock of hair from a lover was quite serious. Therefore, Elinor was surprised to hear such news. She then knew that the growing fondness between Marianne and Willoughby was true.</p>
