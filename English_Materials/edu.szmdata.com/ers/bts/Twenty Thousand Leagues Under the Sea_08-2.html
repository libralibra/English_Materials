	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER EIGHT</p>

	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">Inside the Submarine</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">T</span>his was finished quickly and in silence. Who were these men? Perhaps some new sea thieves, exploring the oceans in their own manner. Just as we were safely inside, the opening was closed, and we were again surrounded by darkness. We were alone. When I looked around, attempting to see in the darkness, Ned Land spoke with great anger, and Conseil attempted to calm him.</p>

	<p>After waiting in the darkness for nearly half an hour, light suddenly appeared all around us, the same electric light I had seen surrounding the submarine. A door was then opened, and two men walked into the room. One was short, very muscular, with thick black hair on his head. He looked to be from southern France. The second stranger I will explain in more detail. He had calm confidence with intelligent black eyes, pale skin, and a tall, strong body. Whether this person was thirty-five or fifty, I did not know, but he was the most self-assured person I had ever seen, with the look of a strong leader.</p>

	<p>The taller of the two, the leader, examined us quietly for a few moments before saying something to the other stranger. I did not understand a word of their strange language. After speaking for a few moments, they both stared at me in silence. I then told them in good French that I did not know his language, but they seemed not to understand me, and I became quite embarrassed.</p>

	<p>"Perhaps if master told them our story," said Conseil, "the gentlemen would understand the words."</p>

	<p>I began to explain our adventure, speaking clearly, announcing our names, as well. They listened politely in silence, but still seemed not to understand. When I finished, they said nothing. I then began speaking in English; perhaps they would then understand. Ned then continued the explanation in English, but the men still said nothing. Conseil then offered to tell our story in German, but the men still did not understand. I attempted an explanation in Latin, but they were silent. The two men, after a few moments of silence, spoke a few words in their mysterious language before leaving the room again.</p>

	<p>"We spoke to those men in French, English, German and Latin, and they were rude enough not to respond once!" Ned exclaimed after the two men left the room.</p>

	<p>"Calm yourself," I said to him, "anger will not help us now."</p>

	<p>"But, Professor, do you not see that we will soon die of hunger in this prison?" Ned responded.</p>

	<p>"We must not worry yet," I said, "We must wait. We still know nothing about the captain of this submarine."</p>

	<p>"I believe him to be our enemy," Ned replied angrily.</p>

	<p>"We still do not know, nor do we know where they come from. The two men look to be from southern Europe. Perhaps they are Spaniards, or even Arabians or Indians. Their language must be quite difficult for us to understand."</p>

	<p>"That is the disadvantage of not having one language used around the world," said Conseil.</p>

	<p>Just then, the door opened, and a new man brought us clothes and coats. I did not know what the material was made of, but we were quite content to have warm clothes. While we changed clothing, the man brought in our meal, on high quality plates of silver. The table looked like the dining room of a grand hotel. The dishes were all excellent, but I could not recognize what we were eating. During the meal, I noticed that each spoon, fork, knife and plate had a letter and a phrase carved into it: MOBILIS IN MOBILI.</p>

	<p>The letter N was certainly the first initial of the name of that mysterious captain who had come in to examine us. The phrase, "Mobilis in Mobili," comes from Latin, meaning "changing within change."</p>

	<p>Ned and Conseil ate their food quickly, as did I. I was then a bit more relaxed, as I realized these mysterious men were not going to let us die of hunger. After finishing our meal, we were ready for sleep.</p>

	<p>"I shall sleep well tonight," said Conseil.</p>

	<p>"So shall I," replied Ned Land.</p>

	<p>My two friends were soon asleep on the floor, but I was still too concerned with our situation to sleep. Where were we? What machine were we now inside, perhaps in the depths of the ocean.</p>
