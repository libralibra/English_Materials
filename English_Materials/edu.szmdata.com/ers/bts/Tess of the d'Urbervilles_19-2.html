	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">One Last Goodbye</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">O</span>ne morning in July, the hot sun shone on two people climbing a hill. They were walking out of a nice city called Wintoncester. They were young, but they looked very sad. It was Angel Clare and Tess' younger sister Liza-Lu. They walked and held hands. They were crying, with tears on their pale faces. No one spoke.</p>

	<p>When they got to the top of the hill, they heard a clock strike eight. They looked at the city and could see the church, the prison and the college. A tall post stood on the prison tower. They saw a black flag move up the post.</p>

	<p>The flag meant that Tess had been killed for her crime. The world was done playing with her. Her terrible life was over. "Justice" had been done and no one cared. Clare and Liza-Lu did not move for a long time. When they were strong enough, they held hands and continued to walk slowly down the road.</p>
