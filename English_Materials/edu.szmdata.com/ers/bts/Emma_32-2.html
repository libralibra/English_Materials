	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER THIRTY-TWO</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">E</span>mma first saw Mrs Elton at church. She, along with Harriet, went that day to the Elton home to meet the new Mrs Elton. Emma did not really like her. Mr Elton had not seen Emma or Harriet since he had told Emma he loved her and wanted to marry her; he acted strangely during the meeting, so obviously he was not at ease. After leaving the Elton home, Harriet began speaking:</p>

	<p>"I wish them happiness. You should not be afraid, Miss Woodhouse, I am no longer in pain over Mr Elton, I am quite content that he could fall in love with such a charming woman."</p>

	<p>Emma decided she must know Mrs Elton more before deciding she did not like her. She and Mr Woodhouse invited the new couple to their home for tea one day. Harriet was not coming for a visit that day.</p>

	<p>Emma decided, during the visit, that Mrs Elton was a selfish woman, with terrible manners.</p>

	<p>"Harriet would make a much better wife," Emma thought to herself.</p>

	<p>Mrs Elton talked the entire time, giving Emma little opportunity to speak.</p>

	<p>"We have visited the Westons, they are such pleasant people. I was surprised to see that Mrs Weston has such wonderful manners. She used to be your caregiver, is that right?" Mrs Elton asked.</p>

	<p>Emma was astonished. She thought to herself, "Of course the woman who raised me, my caretaker, would have incredible manners. Frank Churchill would be surprised at Mrs Elton's impolite manners, as well."</p>

	<p>"Mrs Weston's manners," said Emma, "were always very good."</p>
