	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER ELEVEN</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">M</span>r Pontellier walked back with Madame Lebrun and found Edna resting outside, "What are you doing outside? Why aren't you resting in bed?" he asked.</p>

	<p>Edna said nothing.</p>

	<p>"Are you awake?" Mr Pontellier asked, putting his face near hers.</p>

	<p>"Yes," she answered, looking at him, without any sign that she was sleepy.</p>

	<p>"It's almost two o'clock and it's cold out here. Let's go inside and get some sleep." He then entered the cottage and, after few minutes had passed, called to her to come inside.</p>

	<p>"I'll come in a little later," she replied.</p>

	<p>Returning to the door and sticking his head outside, he asked, "What's wrong with you? Why do you remain out here, where it's so cold?"</p>

	<p>"I'm fine. I've got my sweater."</p>

	<p>"But the insects will eat you alive."</p>

	<p>"They're not bothering me now."</p>

	<p>She could hear him walking about the inside of the cottage. He was clearly upset. Usually she would have done what he asked her to. She did not often think about whether she should or should not. It was simply her habit to do as he asked.</p>

	<p>"Please, Edna. Why don't you come in here with me?" he asked her very gently.</p>

	<p>"No, thanks. I'm quite comfortable out here."</p>

	<p>"Now, look here, woman! You come in here immediately! Stop behaving so strangely!"</p>

	<p>She felt that she had never had this experience with her husband before. This was something new. She was resisting him, fighting him. And it was something that she could not stop herself from doing. The feeling was too strong inside of her to stop it.</p>

	<p>"Leonce, I plan to stay out here. You go on and go to bed, yourself. Stop yelling at me. The next time you do, I'll not listen," she said.</p>

	<p>He did not go to bed, however. Instead, he got a bottle of wine and joined Edna on the porch. She refused the glass that he offered her. He then pulled up a chair near her hammock and smoked a couple of cigars. After that, he went back inside, put on some warmer clothing and poured himself another glass of wine. Once again, Edna refused to drink and he smoked a few more cigars.</p>

	<p>The feeling that the ghost had put over Edna was beginning to leave her. She was becoming more and more aware of her real life now. It suddenly made her very tired. She had no more strength to fight any longer.</p>

	<p>That was the quietest time of the night, the time when everything seems to become silent, waiting for the sun to arise once again.</p>

	<p>Edna got up from the hammock. Her legs had no feeling after having lain there for so long. She moved slowly to the house, and turned around to her husband, "Coming to bed?"</p>

	<p>"I'll be in after this cigar," Mr Pontellier answered.</p>
