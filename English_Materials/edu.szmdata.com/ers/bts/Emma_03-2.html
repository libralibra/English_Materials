	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER THREE</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">M</span>r Woodhouse was a social man, who loved when his friends visited his home. Although, leaving his home late in the evening often frightened him, and he hated large groups of people. Very often, the Woodhouses invited some close friends to their home to dine. Emma was pleased with these dinner parties because Mrs Weston frequently came, as well as Mr George Knightley, who lived nearby at Donwell Abbey manor. Young Mr Elton always came for the evening parties, as well as Mrs and Miss Bates, and Mrs Goddard. Mrs Bates, a widow of the former minister of Highbury, lived with her unmarried daughter, Miss Bates. Mrs Goddard was in charge of a local school for girls.</p>

	<p>One morning, Mrs Goddard sent Emma a note, requesting to bring a student, Miss Harriet Smith. Emma was delighted to have the seventeen-year-old girl come. She had seen Miss Smith many times, but had never spoken to the young beauty. Miss Smith had lived at Mrs Goddard's school for many years. Her parents were unknown to everyone in Highbury, including herself.</p>

	<p>During the dinner party, Mr Woodhouse was upset because he thought large dinners to be unhealthy. Throughout the dinner, he made suggestions to guests to keep in good health.</p>

	<p>"I do not think you should eat the custard. Mrs Goddard, what say you to half a glass of wine?"</p>

	<p>Emma admired Miss Smith's beauty and manners throughout the dinner. Emma soon decided she would find the young Miss Smith a husband. Emma had heard that Miss Smith had been spending time with a young man called Mr Robert Martin. His family was renting a farm from Mr Knightley, who thought the family was quite respectable. However, Emma believed the young Miss Harriet Smith could find a better husband, one with more education and wealth. Harriet was pleased to be invited to such a fancy dinner party, and hoped to become good friends with Emma Woodhouse.</p>
