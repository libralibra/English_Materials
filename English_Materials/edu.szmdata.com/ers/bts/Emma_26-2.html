	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">F</span>rank Churchill did return to Hartfield that day. She still thought he was rather silly for returning to London for just a hair cut, but he was not at all ashamed himself. The Coles' party was the following Tuesday. As she reached the Coles' home, Mr George Knightley had just arrived, and helped her out of her carriage.</p>

	<p>"I am quite glad to see you. You are such a gentleman to help me," Emma told him.</p>

	<p>"How fortunate that we arrive at the same moment, now you see I am truly a gentleman."</p>

	<p>The party was rather large, although, the women of less fortune and class, Miss Bates, Miss Fairfax, and Miss Smith, would arrive later in the evening. Many at the party were discussing Jane Fairfax's new pianoforte, an expensive musical instrument, which was sent to her mysteriously. Most believed the Campbells had sent it as a gift, but Jane thought someone else must have sent it. Jane knew the Campbells would have told her if they were sending such an expensive gift. As Mrs Cole was discussing the grand instrument, Emma noticed that Mr Frank Churchill was smiling contently to himself.</p>

	<p>"Why do you smile?" said she.</p>

	<p>"Perhaps the Campbells did not send the pianoforte," he responded with a curious smile.</p>

	<p>"If Colonel Campbell is not the person, who can it be?"</p>

	<p>"Perhaps Mrs Dixon sent the pianoforte?"</p>

	<p>"Yes, I had not thought of Mrs Dixon. It is Mrs Dixon, I believe."</p>

	<p>"Perhaps not Mrs Dixon, but Mr Dixon sent it."</p>

	<p>"Yes, I am sure Mr and Mrs Dixon sent the present," Emma responded confidently.</p>

	<p>"That is possible, but perhaps Mr Dixon sent the pianoforte alone. It is possible that after he proposed marriage to Mrs Dixon, he met Miss Jane Fairfax and fell in love. That could be her reason for joining us in Highbury, instead of her dear friend, Mrs Dixon and her family in Ireland," Mr Churchill told her.</p>

	<p>"And then, he saved her life. Did you hear of that story? Miss Fairfax almost fell overboard during a dinner party on the sea. Mr Dixon caught her."</p>

	<p>"I was there at the party, it was alarming," Mr Churchill explained.</p>

	<p>"I am quite sure Mr Dixon sent the pianoforte," Emma decided.</p>

	<p>"I must agree with you."</p>

	<p>Throughout the evening, when people would ask Jane Fairfax about the new pianoforte, Emma would smile to herself. She now knew Jane's awful secret that Emma and Mr Churchill shared. She spoke with Mr Churchill often at the party, and was delighted that everyone present must know Mr Churchill was interested in her.</p>

	<p>She began to speak with Mr Cole, and when he turned away, Emma noticed Frank Churchill staring across the room at Miss Fairfax.</p>

	<p>"What is the matter?" asked Emma.</p>

	<p>"Miss Fairfax has done her hair in such a strange manner; I must go ask her whether it is an Irish fashion."</p>

	<p>Mrs Weston soon joined Emma.</p>

	<p>"You know, Emma, I believe Mr George Knightley may be interested in Jane Fairfax," Mrs Weston said with a smile.</p>

	<p>"Mr Knightley and Jane Fairfax!" exclaimed Emma. "Mr Knightley must not marry. I am amazed that you would think of such a thing."</p>

	<p>"Miss Fairfax has always been a favourite of Mr Knightley's."</p>

	<p>"Impossible! She has no fortune herself, and he has never wanted to marry. It would be a shameful marriage," Emma reasoned.</p>

	<p>"I think the two would be a lovely couple. If the Campbells had not sent Jane the pianoforte, it is possible Mr Knightley sent it."</p>

	<p>"If he had intended to give her one, he would have told her."</p>

	<p>After the dinner, the Coles requested that Miss Woodhouse and Miss Fairfax play music for the party. Emma began, and Frank Churchill sang with her for a song. Then, Miss Fairfax sang and played. Emma could not ignore that Miss Fairfax was much more talented than herself, although everyone was quite pleased with Emma's performance.</p>

	<p>Emma noticed that Mr Knightley was very attentive while Miss Fairfax performed. Soon enough, Emma asked Mr Knightley about the pianoforte.</p>

	<p>"This pianoforte is a very kind gift," she began.</p>

	<p>"Yes," he replied quickly, "but surprises are foolish. I thought Colonel Campbell had better judgment than to surprise Miss Fairfax."</p>

	<p>Emma then realized that Mr Knightley certainly did not send the instrument, although she still wondered if he was interested in Jane Fairfax. While they were speaking, Jane Fairfax and Frank Churchill had been singing together, which upset Mr Knightley.</p>

	<p>"That young man," said he, angrily, "only wants to show off his own voice."</p>
