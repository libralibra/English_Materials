	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER TWENTY-NINE</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">T</span>he train ended up taking me all the way to Milan. I arrived just before sunrise. The first thing I saw when I left the train tracks was a Caf&#233;. It had just opened. The man behind the counter served me a cup of coffee and some bread. He then poured me a glass of strong alcohol.</p>

	<p>"No charge," he said, "Tell me a little about the front. How is it going up there?"</p>

	<p>"I'm not sure. All I know is that the Army was running away from the Germans when I left."</p>

	<p>"Does that mean the war is finished?"</p>

	<p>"I doubt it."</p>

	<p>"You know, if you need to hide, I've got a place where you can stay."</p>

	<p>"Thank you. I have somewhere I have to go today, but I will keep your place in mind for the future."</p>

	<p>"One other thing. It's obvious that you've removed your stars from your coat. You wouldn't wear it any longer. Do you have papers? I can get you some if you don't."</p>

	<p>"Identification papers? I don't think I'll need them, but&#160;... again, it's good to know where I can get some." I then got up to go.</p>

	<p>"Remember. I'm always here if you need anything."</p>

	<p>"Thank you," I said and then left.</p>

	<p>I took a carriage to the hospital. The doorman was very happy to see me. I shook his hand and asked if Miss Barkley was there. He told me she was not. She had gone to a town called Stresa with Miss Ferguson. I thanked him and asked that he not tell anyone he had seen me.</p>

	<p>I then got back into the carriage and went to the home of a friend of mine named Simmons. He was the fellow studying opera singing that I had met earlier in the year while recovering from my injuries in Milan. He answered his door still wearing pajamas.</p>

	<p>"I'm in a bit of trouble, Simmons," I said to him.</p>

	<p>"Come in and tell me all about it."</p>

	<p>"How can I get to Switzerland?"</p>

	<p>"You can't. The Italian government won't allow it. Why? Are the police looking for you?"</p>

	<p>"I'm not sure yet. Would you have some clothing I could wear? All I've got is what I have on now."</p>

	<p>"Of course. We are just about the same size. What happened to you? Why aren't you at the front?"</p>

	<p>"Where can I change my clothing?"</p>

	<p>"Just go in the bedroom there and take whatever you want."</p>

	<p>"As soon as you are dressed, we'll eat and then send you up toward Switzerland."</p>

	<p>"Actually I have to go to Stresa first."</p>
