	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">T</span>hough Mrs Jennings often stayed with her children and friends during the majority of the year, she did have a home of her own in London. She announced that she planned to leave near the end of January, and invited Elinor and Marianne to go along. The Middletons would, as well, join her in London at their home in town. Elinor supposed that Marianne would not wish to go, as she rather disliked Mrs Jennings' impolite manners. However, Marianne was overjoyed with the idea of going, as she would perhaps have many opportunities to see her beloved Willoughby.</p>

	<p>"I am delighted with the plan," cried their mother, "it is exactly what I could wish for. You will find Margaret so improved when you come back again! And you will probably see your brother, and whatever may be his faults, or the faults of his wife, he is still your brother, and you should see him occasionally. And perhaps," Mrs Dashwood continued, looking at Elinor with a smile, "you will become closer with your sister-in-law's family."</p>

	<p>Elinor was pained to hear such words, as she had tried for quite some time to show little interest in Edward, but could not tell her family of his great secret.</p>

	<p>The Dashwood girls formally accepted Mrs Jennings' invitation. The Miss Steeles, especially Lucy, looked as if they had never been so happy in their lives after hearing that Elinor and Marianne would be going to London, as well.</p>

	<p>Elinor was not too pleased with the idea of seeing the Steele sisters in London, but she was content to see her sister in complete happiness in going to London. Marianne's only worry was in leaving her mother; Mrs Dashwood's anxiety at Elinor and Marianne's departure was felt, as well. When they parted, Elinor was the only one of the three who seemed not to consider the separation as eternal.</p>

	<p>Their departure took place in the first week of January. The Middletons were to follow in about a week. The Miss Steeles were to travel with their cousins shortly after.</p>
