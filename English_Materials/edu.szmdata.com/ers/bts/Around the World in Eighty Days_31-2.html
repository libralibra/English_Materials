	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER THIRTY-ONE</p>

	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">Fix, the Detective, Helps Phineas Fogg</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">P</span>hineas Fogg found himself twenty hours behind time.</p>

	<p>The detective went to Mr Fogg, and looked at him directly.</p>

	<p>He said, "Seriously, sir, are you in a great hurry?"</p>

	<p>"Very seriously."</p>

	<p>"Is it necessary that you should be in New York on the 11th, before nine o'clock in the evening, the time that the steamer leaves for Liverpool?"</p>

	<p>"It is necessary."</p>

	<p>"And, if your journey had not been stopped by the Indians, you would have reached New York on the morning of the 11th?"</p>

	<p>"Yes. I would have eleven hours before the steamer left."</p>

	<p>"Good! You are twenty hours behind. Twelve from twenty leaves eight. You must regain eight hours. Do you want to try?"</p>

	<p>"On foot?" asked Mr Fogg.</p>

	<p>"No, on a sled," replied Fix. "On a sled with sails. A man has proposed this method to me."</p>

	<p>Phineas Fogg and Fix went to meet the American. His name was Mudge, and he lived near the fort.</p>

	<p>There Mr Fogg saw the strange sled. It ran on two pieces of wood, like skis, and it had two large sails on top. If the wind was good, the sled could travel across the snow faster than a train.</p>

	<p>Mr Fogg made a deal with the owner. The wind was good, and it was blowing from the west. The snow was hard, and Mudge thought they would make it to Omaha in a few hours. From there the trains often ran to New York.</p>

	<p>Mr Fogg did not want Aouda to be out in the cold, so he suggested that she stay at Fort Kearney. Passepartout would take her to Europe by an easier method. But Aouda refused to separate from Mr Fogg, and Passepartout was happy. He did not want to leave his master with Mr Fix.</p>

	<p>It would be difficult to guess the detective's thoughts. Did he still think Phineas Fogg was a very smart thief? Perhaps Fix had changed his mind about Mr Fogg, but he was still going to do his duty.</p>

	<p>At eight o'clock the sled was ready. The passengers put on heavy coats. The two sails were raised, and the sled moved.</p>

	<p>The distance between Fort Kearney and Omaha is at most two hundred miles. If the wind stayed good and they did not have an accident, they might reach Omaha by one o'clock.</p>

	<p>What a journey! It was so cold, the travelers could not speak. The sled was as light as a boat, and Mudge was a skilled driver. All the sails were up, and the wind was strong.</p>

	<p>"If nothing breaks," said Mudge, "we shall get there!"</p>

	<p>Fogg had offered Mudge a great reward.</p>

	<p>The prairie was as flat as a sea. It was like a frozen lake. Even the Platte River was not a problem, because it was frozen.</p>

	<p>Aouda was wrapped in furs and coats. Passepartout's face was as red as the sunset. His good nature was back, and he thought they would make New York in time.</p>

	<p>Passepartout wanted to grab Fix by the hand. He remembered it was the detective that found the sled. Passepartout did nothing, though. One thing, however, Passepartout would never forget. That was the sacrifice Mr Fogg had made. Mr Fogg had risked his fortune and his life. No! His servant would never forget that!</p>

	<p>About noon they crossed the Platte River. Mudge said nothing, but he knew they were close to Omaha. In less than an hour he closed the sails. The Sled went on for a half a mile more. It stopped at last, and Mudge pointed to some buildings covered in snow. "We have got there!" he said.</p>

	<p>Arrived! Arrived at the station that had many trains to the Atlantic!</p>

	<p>The group went straight to the Omaha railway station. A train was waiting. They only had time to get into the cars.</p>

	<p>The train moved quickly across Iowa. During the night it crossed the Mississippi River. The next day, which was the 10th, at four o'clock in the evening, it reached Chicago.</p>

	<p>Nine hundred miles separated Chicago from New York, but there are many trains. Mr Fogg moved quickly, and so did the new train. It passed Indiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey quickly. At last the Hudson River came into view, and at a quarter-past eleven in the evening on the 11th, the train stopped at the station.</p>

	<p>The steamer named China, which was going to Liverpool, had started three-quarters of an hour before!</p>
