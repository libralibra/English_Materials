	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER FORTY-FIVE</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">A</span>fter Willoughby's departure, Elinor sat wondering about his situation, somewhat pitying him. However, her mother soon arrived with Colonel Brandon, and she happily explained that her other daughter was no longer suffering, and was improving quickly. She then explained the event that had just passed. Mrs Dashwood did, indeed, pity him for his current situation. However, she soon informed Elinor that Colonel Brandon had admitted he was in love with Marianne.</p>

	<p>"My Elinor, I must tell you, Colonel Brandon loves Marianne; he has told me so himself."</p>

	<p>Elinor was overjoyed for him, but still pitied poor Willoughby a bit.</p>

	<p>"He told me yesterday as we were traveling that he has loved Marianne since they first met," Mrs Dashwood said. "His love for her is far stronger than Willoughby's."</p>

	<p>"What did you tell him?"</p>

	<p>"Oh! My love, I could give him no answer, as I thought my dear Marianne might be at that moment dying. He was confident in his feelings, however, and did not need an answer from me. He knows that he must wait, as Marianne has recently been hurt, and is still quite young."</p>
