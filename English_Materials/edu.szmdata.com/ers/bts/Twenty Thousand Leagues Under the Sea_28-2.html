	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">The Arabian Tunnel</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">T</span>he next evening, the 10th of February, the Nautilus was floating on the surface of the sea when Ned Land noticed a giant sea animal, similar to a whale, floating a mile away.</p>

	<p>"Do you see that?" he cried with excitement.</p>

	<p>"If you had a spear right now, Master Land, would you want to hunt that animal?" asked the captain.</p>

	<p>"I certainly would, captain."</p>

	<p>"Well, I will allow you to try, but you must be careful. Sometimes, if those animals know they are being hunted, they disappear under water, then turn over the hunter's boat."</p>

	<p>Ned Land, Conseil and I then stepped into the boat with five other men from the Nautilus. We were quickly near the great sea animal, waiting for Ned to throw his spear. Soon enough, Ned threw his spear, but the animal escaped under the waves.</p>

	<p>"I missed!" Ned cried. "I missed hitting it!"</p>

	<p>"No," I said, "it is wounded&#151;look at the blood, but your weapon did not stay in his body."</p>

	<p>"My spear!" cried Ned Land.</p>

	<p>We then saw the sea monster at the surface again, and it continued swimming quickly. We followed for an hour. Suddenly, however, the animal disappeared underwater, then attempted to crash onto the boat, but Ned was prepared for this attack. He threw his spear into the sea monster's heart, and it was dead. This giant weighed nearly 10,000 pounds. Several men had to help lift the sea animal onto the platform.</p>

	<p>The next day, the 11th of February, the Nautilus remained underwater until close to ten o'clock in the evening. We would be on the surface of the water for a short time to refill our air supply before returning under the water to enter the Arabian Tunnel. The captain would direct the Nautilus through the mysterious tunnel. The submarine entered the tunnel boldly. We heard the strange sound of the Red Sea's waters, which moved toward the Mediterranean quickly. I watched the captain carefully. I was full of anxiety, afraid we might crash in that underground tunnel of water.</p>

	<p>At thirty-five minutes past ten, the captain turned to me.</p>

	<p>"The Mediterranean!" he said with a smile.</p>

	<p>In less than twenty minutes, the Nautilus had passed under the small piece of land, the Isthmus of Suez, which separates Europe from Africa.</p>
