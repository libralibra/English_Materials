	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER EIGHT</p>

	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">Events</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">M</span>rs de R&#x00EA;nal's happiness lessened when she thought of her maid, Elisa. The girl had inherited some money and confessed to Father Ch&#x00E9;lan that she wanted to marry Julien. The priest was delighted for his friend Julien, and was surprised when the tutor refused.</p>

	<p>"Be careful," the priest said, "of what you desire. I see strong ambition in you. Seeking fortune is not horrible for common people, but as a member of the church it is a path to Hell."</p>

	<p>For the first time in his life, Julien knew someone cared for him. Yet Julien was angry with himself. "Father Ch&#x00E9;lan thinks I wouldn't make a good priest. He's the one with whom I must be dishonest, but I failed," he thought.</p>

	<p>Mrs de R&#x00EA;nal noticed Elisa's new fortune did not make her happier, and she asked her maid why. At last Elisa talked to her about marriage. For the next few days, Mrs de R&#x00EA;nal felt ill; she thought always of Julien and Elisa's happy new life. She even hated Elisa.</p>

	<p>She soon saw that Elisa was more troubled than before. Elisa confessed that Julien had refused her. Mrs de R&#x00EA;nal immediately felt better, but she wanted to try to convince Julien herself.</p>

	<p>The next day she spent an hour trying to convince Julien. He refused again and again, and Mrs de R&#x00EA;nal's heart filled with happiness. She suddenly felt ill again. When recovered in her room she asked herself at last: Could I be in love with Julien?</p>

	<p>When spring came the family went to the countryside. Mrs de R&#x00EA;nal's happiness only increased, and she began changing her dresses three times a day. She spoke with Julien every day, although always on harmless topics. Soon she brought her cousin, Mrs Derville, to the house.</p>

	<p>Julien felt happy as well. He was away from the public and when Mr de R&#x00EA;nal was away he could read his books without fear. Napoleon said things about women, and Julien now thought the same things boys of his age had thought long before.</p>

	<p>One evening Julien was talking with the two young women in the garden, and he accidentally touched the back of Mrs de R&#x00EA;nal's hand. She moved it away. Julien decided it was his duty to touch the hand again and hold it. This idea of duty took away all the pleasure from his heart.</p>
