	<p class="storyTitle">38. Water Turned to Wine</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">J</span>esus' disciples followed him almost everywhere he went. They listened and learned about God from him, so they could help spread the good news to other people.</p>

	<p>Mary, Jesus' mother, went with him one day to a wedding being held in the village of Cana. After the ceremony, everyone joined in a big celebration that was like a reception. The host served wine, a custom in those days.</p>

	<p>Not long after the party began, the servants discovered they were out of wine. Mary heard them and turned to Jesus. "They have no more wine," she said.</p>

	<p>"What can I do, Mother?" Jesus said to her. "It is not yet time for me to do miracles."</p>

	<p>But Mary told the servants to do whatever Jesus asked them to do.</p>

	<p>Jesus saw six pots sitting next to the door. They were the pots the Jewish people used to hold water for the purification ceremony before a meal.</p>

	<p>"Fill these with water," Jesus told the servants.</p>

	<p>When they obeyed, Jesus told them to take a cupful over to the chief steward. The steward took the cup to his lips.</p>

	<p>'"I thought you served the best wine first," he then said to the bridegroom, "but this is far better than anything else we've drunk this evening."</p>

	<p>The disciples were amazed by what they saw. Their teacher had performed a miracle by turning water into wine. Only a few people at the wedding realized what Jesus had done. Soon news of his miracles spread across the land, and people came from far and near to see him.</p>
