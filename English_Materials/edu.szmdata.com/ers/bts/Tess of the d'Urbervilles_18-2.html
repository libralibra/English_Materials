	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER EIGHTEEN</p>

	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">The Final Chase</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">A</span>ngel Clare had returned to his hotel. He sat at the table for a while, eating his breakfast and looking at the street. A note arrived from his mother. It said that his brother Cuthbert was going to marry Mercy Chant. Angel threw away the note.</p>

	<p>Finally, he got up, paid his bill and walked to the railway station. Angel found it hard to sit and wait for the next train. It would not come for another hour. Now he had nothing to hope for in love and no one to love. He wasn't in a hurry, but he wanted to get out of town.</p>

	<p>He started to walk along a road that led out of town. The road was open, and it dropped down into a valley. On the other side of the valley, Angel stopped to rest. When he turned around, he saw a small woman running very fast. As she came closer, he saw that it was Tess.</p>

	<p>"I saw you turn around and leave the station," she said. She was very out of breath. "I've been following you." She was pale, out of breath and shaking. Clare took Tess in his arms and helped her walk. They walked under trees so no one could see them.</p>

	<p>"Angel, I want you to know I killed him."</p>

	<p>Angel thought Tess might be going crazy.</p>

	<p>"I don't know how I managed to do it, but I had to. I had to kill him for us. A long time ago, I hit him in the face. He bled, but I didn't kill him because I was too afraid. But I thought I might kill him one day. I never loved him, Angel. Please believe me. He came between us and ruined both of our lives. Why did you go away and leave me? I loved you so much. You must forgive me now. I cannot bear to be away from you anymore. I had to kill him. Say you love me, please. Say you do."</p>

	<p>"Of course I love you, Tess. My feelings are the same." Clare held Tess in his arms. "What do you mean when you say you killed him?"</p>

	<p>"He heard me crying. He said bad things about you so I killed him."</p>

	<p>Angel understood that Tess had found the strength to kill d'Urberville. He was amazed. She made him forget the difference between right and wrong. She did not realize the seriousness of what she had done. She seemed very happy.</p>

	<p>Angel knew he could not leave Tess. She thought he would protect her, and Clare felt only love for his loving wife. He kissed her again and again on the mouth and face and neck. He held her.</p>

	<p>"I won't leave you," he said. "I will protect you no matter what."</p>

	<p>They walked through the woods and avoided other people.</p>

	<p>"Where will we go?" asked Tess.</p>

	<p>"I don't know. Can you walk a long way?"</p>

	<p>"I could walk forever with you."</p>

	<p>"We can walk away from the sea. When they stop looking for us, we can find a way to leave the country."</p>

	<p>They were like children, only able to think of the present time. They liked walking together in the nice weather. But at night there was no place to stay and it was cold outside. Eventually, they found an old, empty house to stay in. There was plenty of food and wine, and the happy couple went to bed.</p>

	<p>They stayed for five more days, and had the good marriage they had not had. Neither of them wanted to leave. Inside the house was love and forgiveness. Outside punishment waited for them.</p>

	<p>"I'm afraid you might hate me someday for what I have done," said Tess. "If that happens, I would want to die."</p>

	<p>A person came back to the house, and the married couple had to run. While they were hiding in the woods, Tess said, "I only have a few weeks left before they find and kill me. I wish we had stayed in the house where we were so happy."</p>

	<p>"Don't say that Tess. They won't find us."</p>

	<p>They walked all day and night. Clare kissed Tess. She looked at him and he still seemed perfect.</p>

	<p>"I love it here," she said. "There is no one in the world but us two. We have only nature and the sky above our faces."</p>

	<p>Clare decided it was time to rest. He put his coat on Tess and sat down beside her. They were quiet for a little while. Then Tess said, "Angel, if anything happens to me please take care of Liza-Lu. She is good and pure. I want you to marry her if you lose me."</p>

	<p>"If I lose you, I will lose everything."</p>

	<p>"She is just like me but without any of the bad. It would seem like we were still close if she were yours after I die."</p>

	<p>Angel looked so sad that Tess said no more. Tess fell asleep as the sun began to rise in the sky.</p>

	<p>Clare saw something moving in the distance. It was a person. Clare wished they had kept on walking, but it was too late. He saw many men in uniform walk towards them. They were surrounding Tess.</p>

	<p>Clare jumped to his feet and looked for a way to escape.</p>

	<p>"Stop, sir," shouted one policeman. "It's no use. We've surrounded the place and won't let you go."</p>

	<p>"Please let her sleep," begged Clare. The men gathered around Tess. Clare held her hand. She looked like a trapped animal. When the sunlight was strong, Tess woke up.</p>

	<p>"Have they come for me, Angel?"</p>

	<p>"Yes, dear, they have."</p>

	<p>"Our happiness could not have lasted forever." Tess stood up and walked towards the waiting men. "I am ready to go," she whispered.</p>
