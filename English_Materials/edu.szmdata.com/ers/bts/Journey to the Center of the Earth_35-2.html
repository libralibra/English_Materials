	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER THIRTY-FIVE</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">F</span>riday, August 21</p>

	<p>This morning, the amazing geyser on Axel Island disappeared from our view. The weather was soon to change. The air was wet. There were many more thick clouds than before, and the sea was calm, just as before a storm.</p>

	<p>"There's going to be a storm," I said. Then, there was silence between us as we watched the changing sky. The wind got much stronger, throwing us around the raft, although Hans did not seem to be affected by the changing weather. I suggested that we take down the sail, but my uncle refused, hoping it would take us closer to the south side of the sea. I feared that with the strong winds, however, the sail would fall and crush us. He still refused.</p>

	<p>Sunday, August 23</p>

	<p>Where are we? We are moving through the sea at an incredible speed.</p>

	<p>Last night was horrible. The storm is still around us. Our ears are hurting greatly with the terrible sounds of the storm. We cannot even talk to each other.</p>

	<p>The lightening never stops, and it's always followed by the crack of loud thunder. The temperature is also much warmer now.</p>

	<p>Monday, August 24</p>

	<p>I wonder if this terrible storm will ever end. We're tired. Hans is the same as always. The raft is still moving quickly. We've traveled more than five hundred miles from Axel Island.</p>

	<p>At noon, the storm became stronger. We haven't been able to talk to each other for three days. We only hear the sounds of the storm.</p>

	<p>My uncle came close to me and said something. I thought it was, "We're lost," but I wasn't sure.</p>

	<p>I answered by writing, "Let's take down the sail."</p>

	<p>He agreed. Just then, a strong wind blew the sail down and flew off the raft. The electric light had, at times, became stronger during the storm. It was an electrical storm. Late in the day, the winds and electrical lightening became stronger than ever, and almost took me away. Soon after, however, the light disappeared. Where are we going? Where?</p>

	<p>Tuesday, August 25</p>

	<p>I just woke up. The storm is still strong. Lightening is everywhere. Are we still at sea? Yes, and moving quite quickly. We have passed under England, France, maybe under all of Europe.</p>

	<p>I hear a new sound, of waves breaking on rocks. Then&#160;...&#160;</p>
