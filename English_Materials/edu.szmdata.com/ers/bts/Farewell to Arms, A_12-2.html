	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER TWELVE</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">I</span> woke up later in the day to a room full of sunlight. I called Miss Gage into my room and asked her to find someone who could shave me. She opened my closet, took my bottle of wine out, and said: "This bottle was in your hands last night while you were sleeping."</p>

	<p>"Ah, I'm sorry, it's&#160;...&#160;"</p>

	<p>"You should share with people while you are drinking. Next time, you should call me here to drink with you!"</p>

	<p>"Oh, I didn't think you would allow me to drink it. I'll tell you next time. Thanks!"</p>

	<p>She laughed, and said, "Oh, by the way, Miss Catherine Barkley is here already!"</p>

	<p>"Really, that's great news! Thanks!"</p>

	<p>"She's not very nice though!"</p>

	<p>"She is. You just need time to get to know her!"</p>

	<p>She did not say anything, cleaned my body, and went away.</p>

	<p>Ten minutes later, an Italian man came and shaved my face for me. I was in a good mood and wanted to chat a little, but he was not very friendly toward me. I asked him what was wrong and he simply answered that he refused to speak with dogs. I assumed he was crazy and decided to say nothing more to him. After he left, I called for the doorman. He entered my room laughing.</p>

	<p>"What's so funny? Next time, find a guy who's not crazy to shave me."</p>

	<p>"He misunderstood me when I told him where you were from and thought that you were Austrian," he said, still laughing.</p>

	<p>"Take your laughing ass back downstairs!" I shouted. The sound of his laughter still could be heard several minutes after he left my room.</p>

	<p>Then my door opened again, and Catherine entered the room. She smiled, walked over to my bed and gave me a kiss. At that moment, I thought she was the prettiest woman I had ever seen. I was extremely happy to see her.</p>

	<p>"Do you feel any better, dear?"</p>

	<p>"Yes, as soon as I saw you!"</p>

	<p>I reached out and brought her closer to me, "No, you can't do that here! You are wounded!" she said.</p>

	<p>"I'm well enough to have sex!"</p>

	<p>"No, you are not. You are still weak!"</p>

	<p>"Just shut up and do it!"</p>

	<p>"But do you love me?"</p>

	<p>"I do. I love you. I've said it many many times. Keep your mouth closed and have sex with me!"</p>

	<p>"Alright, but we'll have to be quick."</p>

	<p>Afterward, I felt calm inside. She sat down in the chair next to my bed.</p>

	<p>"You see? I must really love you, if I can allow myself to do something so crazy," she said. "We can't do that too often."</p>

	<p>"Of course, we can. Every night we'll do it."</p>

	<p>"I wonder how long they'll let me work here."</p>

	<p>"They can't send you away. I won't let them. I love you too much now."</p>

	<p>"You really do, don't you?"</p>

	<p>I did. It was not my plan, but it was too late.</p>

	<p>"I should go. I've stayed too long."</p>

	<p>"Don't stay away too long. I'll miss you."</p>

	<p>"I'll miss you too." Then she left.</p>
