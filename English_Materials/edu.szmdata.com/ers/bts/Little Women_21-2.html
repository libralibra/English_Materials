	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE</p>

	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">Aunt March Settles the Question</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">T</span>he girls and their mother remained gathered around Mr March the next day, leaving their duties to be done later. Nothing seemed needed to complete their happiness, but something was needed; Mr and Mrs March looked at one another with an anxious expression as they watched Meg carefully. Jo was seen giving Brooke's umbrella which was left in the hall angry looks; Meg was shy and became quite embarrassed when John's name was mentioned; Amy said, "Everyone seems to be waiting for something," and Beth wondered why the neighbors didn't run over as usual.</p>

	<p>One afternoon as Mr Brooke came in for a visit, he found Meg alone in the sitting room.</p>

	<p>"Good afternoon. How is your father?" he asked, looking a bit confused.</p>

	<p>"He's quite well. I'll get him, and tell him you're here," said Meg, standing up nervously.</p>

	<p>"Don't go. Are you afraid of me, Margaret?" he asked, looking quite hurt.</p>

	<p>"How can I be afraid of you when you have been so kind to Father? I only wish I could thank you for it."</p>

	<p>"Meg, I care about you deeply, and only want to know if you care for me a little. I love you so much, dear," explained Mr Brooke tenderly.</p>

	<p>"I'm&#151;I'm too young," said Meg after a moment of silence.</p>

	<p>"I'll wait, and in the meantime, you could be learning to like me, couldn't you, dear?"</p>

	<p>"Oh, please go away and let me be!" exclaimed Meg, feeling quite confused and frightened.</p>

	<p>Poor Mr Brooke looked as if his lovely castle in the air was being destroyed, as he had never seen Meg speak with such anger before.</p>

	<p>"Do you really mean that?" he asked anxiously, following her as she walked away.</p>

	<p>"Yes, I do. I don't want to be worried about such things right now."</p>

	<p>"May I hope you'll change your mind? I'll wait and say nothing till you have had more time," he said sadly as he walked toward the door.</p>

	<p>At that moment, Aunt March walked into the room.</p>

	<p>The old lady couldn't resist coming to see Mr March. She had walked through the house quietly, hoping to surprise them. She did surprise two of them, and Mr Brooke quickly went into the next room.</p>

	<p>"Well, what is this?" cried the old lady.</p>

	<p>"Oh, this is Father's friend. I'm so surprised to see you!" said Meg in confusion.</p>

	<p>"Oh no, that's the boy's tutor, is it true? I understand now. You haven't agreed to marry him, have you?" cried Aunt March.</p>

	<p>"Hush! He'll hear."</p>

	<p>"Now, I have something to tell you. Now, you tell me quickly, do you plan to marry this young man? If you do, not one penny of my great fortune will be given to you. Remember that, and don't be foolish," said the old lady.</p>

	<p>"I shall marry whom I please, Aunt March, and you can leave your money to anyone you like," she said bravely.</p>

	<p>"Well, you'll soon regret that!" exclaimed Aunt March. "No, I won't. Father and Mother like John, though he is poor. John is good and wise, with a great deal of talent, and he's willing to work. Everyone likes and respects him, and I'm proud to think he cares for me, though I'm so poor and young and silly," said Meg, looking prettier than ever in her sincerity.</p>

	<p>"He knows you have rich relatives, child; that's the secret of his liking, I suspect."</p>

	<p>"Aunt March, what a terrible thing to say! I won't listen to you a minute longer if you talk that way. My John wouldn't marry for money any more than I would. We are willing to work, and we plan to wait. I'm not afraid of being poor, as I've been happy so far, and I know I shall be with him because he loves me, and I&#151;" Meg stopped, remembering that she hadn't made a decision yet. Aunt March was very angry, as she had planned to find a rich husband for the pretty young girl.</p>

	<p>"Well, I'm finished with helping you, then. I'm disappointed in you, and don't have the will to see your father now. Don't expect anything from me when you are married. Your Mr Brooke's friends must take care of you. I'm done with you forever," she said as she went out of the front door quickly.</p>

	<p>As Meg sat down, she was shocked to hear Mr Brooke's voice, saying, "Thank you for defending me, and Aunt March for proving that you do care for me a little bit."</p>

	<p>"I didn't know how much when you had asked me," began Meg.</p>

	<p>"And I don't need to go away, but may stay and be happy, dear?"</p>

	<p>"Yes, John," she said, hiding her face as he went to sit next to her.</p>

	<p>Jo was astonished to see the two together when she walked into the room a moment later, seeing the two lovers sitting and laughing together.</p>

	<p>"Sister Jo, congratulate us!"exclaimed Mr Brooke after seeing her expression.</p>

	<p>Mr and Mrs March soon walked into the room, looking silendy delighted. The little girls, as well, considered it a most agreeable and interesting event.</p>

	<p>"I hope the third year from now will end well with a wedding. Shall work now to work out my plans," said Mr Brooke, smiling at Meg, as if everything had become possible to him now.</p>

	<p>"Doesn't it seem like a very long time to wait?" asked Amy, who was in a hurry for the wedding.</p>

	<p>"I've got so much to learn before I shall be ready, it seems a rather short time to me," answered Meg.</p>

	<p>"You have only to wait, I am to do the work," said John.</p>

	<p>"I don't approve of the matter, but I've made up my mind to bear it, and shall not say a word against it," said Jo sincerely. "You can't know how hard it is for me to give up Meg," she continued.</p>

	<p>"Well, now, don't be upset," said Laurie cheerfully. "Meg is happy, Brooke will get settled, Grandpa will help him, and it will be wonderful to see Meg in her own little house. We'll have excellent times after she is gone, as I shall be finished with college by that time and we'll go abroad on a nice trip. Would that help you?"</p>

	<p>"I think it would, but no one knows what will happen in three years," said Jo thoughtfully.</p>
