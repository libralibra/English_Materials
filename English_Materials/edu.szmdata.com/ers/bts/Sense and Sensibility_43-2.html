	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER FORTY-THREE</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">T</span>he next morning, Marianne got up early, hoping that her illness had been cured. She spent the day in front of the fireplace, but her health had only worsened. The Palmers' doctor was called to the house, who declared that Marianne, indeed, had an 'infection.' Such a word greatly alarmed Mrs Palmer, as she feared her young child might soon become ill. She announced she would take her child to stay at a neighbor's home until Marianne's health improved. She, as well, demanded that her husband go along; he was not pleased to have to leave the party, however.</p>

	<p>Mrs Jennings declared that she would remain with Marianne until her health improved. Upon hearing such tender words, Elinor came to greatly love and respect that old woman. Colonel Brandon stayed, as well, worried about Marianne's health. For the next few days, Marianne's health did not improve, although the doctor came to see her every day.</p>

	<p>A short time later one night, Elinor became quite worried, as her sister had quite a high fever, and was speaking wildly.</p>

	<p>"Is Mama coming?"</p>

	<p>"Not yet," replied Elinor in terror, "but she will be here soon, I hope."</p>

	<p>"But she must not come through London," cried Marianne. "I shall never see her if she goes to London."</p>

	<p>Elinor realized that Marianne was, indeed, quite ill, and called the doctor immediately. Colonel Brandon saw her great alarm and offered to go to Barton to fetch Mrs Dashwood, as Marianne might soon die. Elinor was grateful for his care and support.</p>

	<p>The next day, Marianne's health had improved greatly. Mrs Dashwood and Colonel Brandon were expected to return the next evening at ten o'clock. Elinor was anxiously waiting, but was rather confused when she heard a carriage arrive at eight o'clock. Soon enough, Willoughby walked into the room, and greeted her nervously. Never in her life had Elinor found it so difficult to be calm!</p>
