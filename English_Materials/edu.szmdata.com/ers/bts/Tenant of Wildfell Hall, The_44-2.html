	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">The Escape</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">O</span>ctober 24th&#151;I am free and safe at last! We left early in the morning when the sky was still dark. Benson helped us leave, and cried as we said goodbye, and wished us good luck.</p>

	<p>The journey was a very long one, and we were quite tired when we arrived at Wildfell Hall. During the travel, I worried that perhaps Frederick had not received the letter, but as we arrived, I saw a light in the window of the Hall, and my fears were gone. Frederick had employed an old woman to keep the house warm, and to have a meal prepared for us. She informed us that Frederick would come to visit the following morning.</p>

	<p>The rooms had little furniture, and it was obvious that no one had lived there in many years. Frederick did, indeed, come the next morning, although he must be careful when he comes, as no one in the neighbourhood knows of my secret.</p>

	<p>I have now been here nearly two weeks, but still worry that I may soon be discovered and be forced to return to my husband. My brother has informed me that Mr Huntingdon is spending a great deal of time and effort attempting to find out where I am. He recently went to Staningley, thinking that my aunt would, perhaps, know of my location. He has written to my brother, as well, asking him to tell him where to find me, but my brother tells him nothing, of course. My husband has suggested that I return our child to him, and I am free to live my life away from him, but I could never separate from my dear little Arthur; he is my only joy in life, and I will never leave him.</p>

	<p>30th&#151;My kind neighbours will not leave me alone! Three families have recently visited Wildfell Hall, attempting to discover who I am and where I have come from. I am quite annoyed with their many visits, as I am frightened they will soon find out the truth.</p>

	<p>November 3rd&#151;I have begun to know my neighbours better. I met a fine gentleman, Gilbert Markham&#160;...&#160;</p>

	<p>Here is where the journal ends. The rest was torn away. How cruel&#151;she was just beginning to speak of me!</p>
