	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">C</span>harles, of course, saw every action of the Schlegels as an attempt to get hold of Howards End. When he met Tibby that afternoon, he did not yet know about Helen's request to stay the night there. However, his list of complaints about her was already quite long enough for him to feel that something needed to be done about her. He feared for his father's reputation, and, of course, his own.</p>

	<p>"Tell me the name of the man who got your sister pregnant," he demanded from Tibby.</p>

	<p>"I'm afraid I don't know," Tibby answered, his face turning a little red at the thought of his sister's visit to his dormitory.</p>

	<p>"I can see from your face that you're lying. She must have mentioned someone the last time she spoke with you. Who?" He began to shout in order to frighten Tibby. Unfortunately, it worked.</p>

	<p>"Well&#160;... she did mention the Basts."</p>

	<p>"Who?"</p>

	<p>"You know, the two people she brought to Evie's wedding party."</p>

	<p>"You mean, she and&#160;... Oh my goodness! My poor father, what have you gotten yourself into?" he cried, and then ran off. Tibby stood alone in the doorway, feeling ashamed for having revealed his sister's secret and his own weakness.</p>

	<p>Margaret and Helen sat under the large Elm tree that stood next to Howards End and talked. They talked only about Helen's problems. Margaret chose not to mention her own.</p>

	<p>"None of this is Leonard's fault," started Helen, "When he and I talked that night at the hotel&#160;... I don't know&#160;... I just felt so lonely. And with Paul Wilcox it was the same thing: loneliness. Afterward, it sounds bad, but I didn't ever want to see Leonard again. I tried giving him money, but he wouldn't accept it." Then she paused for a moment and changed her expression from sad to serious, "I promise that I won't bother you any longer about Mr Wilcox. I can never be persuaded to like him, but I understand now why you married him. And I'm sure you'll be fine."</p>

	<p>Margaret remained silent. She knew that Henry would probably forgive her for what she had said, but she wondered if she really wanted him to. What was the point? She had a sudden desire to be forgotten by him entirely.</p>

	<p>"I think in some ways we'll always be wandering around the earth without a real home," Helen continued, "Why don't you come with me to Germany?"</p>

	<p>Margaret had recently started to appreciate England. She wasn't sure that leaving this country would make her happy. "But would your friend, Monica, and I get along?" she asked.</p>

	<p>"Of course not, but I still want you to come."</p>

	<p>"Let's not make any plans or talk any more about the past tonight. We should sleep. Come along."</p>

	<p>Margaret took Helen's hand in hers and walked into the house and up the stairs. She put her into bed and got in beside her. Helen fell asleep almost immediately, while Margaret lay there thinking about how amazing it was that it had been Leonard Bast who gave her this peaceful night with her sister. She felt the presence of Mrs Wilcox. She was everywhere, and everything was a part of her, even Leonard Bast.</p>
