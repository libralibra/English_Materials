	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER FOUR</p>

	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">My New Friend</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">T</span>he next morning we got up in the dark. In all the rooms it was as cold as ice. This time the porridge was not burned, but I still felt hungry because there was not enough.</p>

	<p>The girl I had spoken with yesterday was older than me, so she was in a higher class. Her name was Helen Burns. Her history teacher, Miss Scatcherd, seemed to think Helen did everything wrong. She always spoke to Helen in this way:</p>

	<p>"Burns, hold your head up, can't you!"</p>

	<p>"Burns, don't stand like that!"</p>

	<p>I thought that Miss Scatcherd's history questions seemed very hard. However, Helen always knew all the answers. She was so smart that I did not understand why the teacher did not like her. That day, she looked at Helen and suddenly said,</p>

	<p>"You dirty girl! You didn't wash your hands this morning!"</p>

	<p>I was surprised that Helen did not tell her that we could not wash ourselves, because the water had been frozen! Miss Scatcherd said something to Helen that I could not hear. Then Helen left the room and returned, carrying a stick. The teacher took it and hit Helen several times with it. I was horrified, but the girl did not cry or change her expression.</p>

	<p>"Wicked girl!" said Miss Scatcherd. "Nothing will change your dirty habits!"</p>

	<p>During the play hour, I found Helen alone, reading the same book as before, and I started talking to her.</p>

	<p>"Do you want to leave Lowood?" I asked her.</p>

	<p>"No, I don't. I was sent to school here, so I must learn as much as I can."</p>

	<p>I was very surprised. "But Miss Scatcherd is so cruel to you!" I cried.</p>

	<p>"She's not cruel. She is strict, and she knows my faults." Helen said.</p>

	<p>I said angrily, "Why, if she hit me with a stick, I'd grab it and break it under her nose!"</p>

	<p>"I don't think you would," answered Helen quietly. "And if you did, Mr Brocklehurst would send you away, and your relations would be angry. Anyway, the <i>Bible</i> tells us to do good things, even when others hurt us. Life can be hard, but we must try."</p>

	<p>I could not understand Helen's ideas, but I had a feeling she was right. I looked at her in amazement.</p>

	<p>"You say you have faults, Helen. What are they? To me you seem very good."</p>

	<p>"You are wrong," she answered. "I am careless, and I forget the rules of the school. I read when I should be doing my homework. So, Miss Scatcherd is right to scold me."</p>

	<p>"Is Miss Temple as strict as that?" I asked.</p>

	<p>A soft smile passed over Helen's normally serious face.</p>

	<p>"Miss Temple is very kind. She is full of goodness. She gently tells me my mistakes, and is always happy when I do well. But even when she helps me, I am always dreaming, and thinking about other things. Then I can't answer the teacher's questions."</p>

	<p>"But today in history class you knew all the answers!" I said.</p>

	<p>"I thought it was an interesting subject, that's all," she replied.</p>

	<p>"You must think Miss Temple's lessons are interesting, because you like her and she is good to you. I'm like that. I love those who love me, and I hate those who punish me unfairly."</p>

	<p>"You should read the <i>Bible</i>, Jane. People who believe in Jesus Christ should love their enemies," said Helen.</p>

	<p>"Then I would love the Reed family, which is impossible," I cried.</p>

	<p>Helen listened carefully to the long story of my life at Gateshead.</p>

	<p>"Well," I asked at the end, "Mrs Reed is a bad woman, isn't she? Don't you agree with me?"</p>

	<p>"It's true she is unkind, but only because she dislikes your faults. Look how angrily you remember every word! You would be happier if you tried to forget her scolding. Life is too short to hate other people, Jane. We all have faults, but when we die, only the pure flame of the spirit will be left. That's why I never think of revenge, I never consider life unfair. I live in calm, looking forward to the end."</p>

	<p>For a moment we both stayed silent. Then one of the big girls came up, calling, "Helen Burns! You go and put away your work immediately or I'll tell Miss Scatcherd!"</p>

	<p>Helen sighed, but stood up and silently obeyed her.</p>
