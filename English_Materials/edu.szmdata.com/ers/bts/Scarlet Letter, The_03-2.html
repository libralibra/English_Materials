	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER THREE</p>

	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">The Recognition</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">H</span>ester soon turned to see, on the outside of the crowd, an American Indian, dressed in native traditional-style clothing, but it was common for the American Indians of the nearby areas to enter the town. By the American Indian's side, stood a white man, dressed in a strange mix of English and American Indian-style clothing.</p>

	<p>He was a small man, with an older-looking face. Hester noticed that the man's left shoulder was slightly misshapen. She then pulled her child close to her, forcing the poor babe to cry in pain, but the mother did not seem to hear it.</p>

	<p>At his arrival in the market place, and some time before she saw him, the stranger had noticed Hester Prynne. At first, he had not recognized her, but very soon however, he gave a look of angry hate. His face darkened as he realized that she knew him. He then quietly raised his finger to his lips, as if to tell her to keep his identity as her husband a secret.</p>

	<p>He then turned to the townsman next to him, "Good sir," said he, "who is this woman? Why has she been punished?"</p>

	<p>"You must be a stranger, friend," answered the townsman, "or you surely would have heard of Mistress Hester Prynne, and her evil doings. She has dishonored herself and the church of Minister Dimmesdale. This evil woman had come over to America from England nearly two years ago. She was the wife of an English professor, who had not yet come to meet her, as he had business affairs to settle. This woman has been a settler here in Boston, with no news from her husband, this gentleman professor, Master Prynne. His young wife, has been alone here, and come into trouble, with no husband here to care for her."</p>

	<p>"Ah! I understand," said the stranger, with a bitter smile. "The old professor should be the father of this babe, nearly three or four months old, which Mistress Prynne is holding in her arms?" "Honestly, friend, no one knows the name of the father," answered the townsman. "Madam Hester absolutely refuses to speak the name of the child's father. Perhaps the guilty man is present with us, looking at this sad woman, and forgets that God sees him."</p>

	<p>"The old professor," said the stranger, with another smile, "should come himself, to discover the truth."</p>

	<p>"The usual punishment for this crime is death, but this woman is youthful and alone, having no one to care for her; perhaps her husband is, indeed, dead. The town judges have pitied this woman, and have declared that she will not die for her crime, but will instead stand on this platform for three hours. Then, for the rest of her life, she will wear that scarlet letter on her chest as punishment."</p>

	<p>"This punishment seems to be much wiser than that of death. She will forever remember her terrible crime. Although, it upsets me that the partner in her crime has not stood with her on the platform. But, he will be known! He will be known! He will be known!"</p>

	<p>While this was happening, Hester Prynne had been standing on the platform, continuing to stare at the stranger. All else around her had disappeared, as she had become focused on the stranger. Although she was quite ashamed at seeing him again in this manner, she was thankful she did not have to meet him. It was better to stand in front of a thousand people than to meet him alone. She was so focused on the stranger that she hardly heard the voice speaking to her.</p>

	<p>"Listen to me, Hester Prynne!" said the voice.</p>

	<p>Speaking from the balcony above her platform, Governor Bellingham, the leader of the town, sat proudly with four other town leaders by his side. He was an older man, strict and commanding with his townspeople. These leaders were good, fair men, but were not the most able to decide a punishment for the mistake of a young woman's heart. As she heard the governor speak her name, she turned her head toward the town leaders, and became pale and nervous.</p>

	<p>The town's most famous minister, John Wilson, the oldest minister in Boston, then stepped down to speak to her. He was a kind but fair man, who believed that Hester had made a terrible mistake.</p>

	<p>"Hester Prynne," said the minister, "I have spoken to my dear friend, Minister Dimmesdale, your religious leader, and have asked that he persuade you to speak the name of your child's father," he said as he turned to a pale-looking young man. "You must no longer hide the name of the man who has tempted you to do evil. But Minister Dimmesdale opposes me; he believes it to be wrong to force you to tell your secrets in front of the crowd of people. I have tried to persuade him, as your partner in this crime should be known. What do you say, Brother Dimmesdale? Shall you persuade this poor prisoner, or shall I?"</p>

	<p>There was silence for a moment before the noble Governor Bellingham spoke:</p>

	<p>"Good Minister Dimmesdale," said he, "the responsibility of this woman's soul is yours. You should, therefore, persuade this young woman to admit the name of her child's father."</p>

	<p>At that moment, the crowd turned to Minister Dimmesdale, a young minister who had come from one of the great English universities, and was highly respected in the new American town. He was shy but spoke like an angel, which greatly influenced the community.</p>

	<p>"Speak to the woman, my brother," said Mr Wilson. "Her soul must be clean, and therefore, as the Governor has said, you must persuade her to speak."</p>

	<p>Minister Dimmesdale looked down and began to pray, then walked to Hester.</p>

	<p>"Hester Prynne," said he, "you have heard what these good men have said. If you wish for your soul to have peace, you must speak the name of your child's father. Do not be silent because you pity him, as he should stand next to you on the platform of shame, rather than have a guilty heart throughout his life. Perhaps he does not have the courage to speak himself, so you must speak his name now."</p>

	<p>The young minister's voice was sweet, deep and weak. All the listeners felt pity as they heard him speak. Even the baby in Hester's arms became peaceful, staring at the minister as he spoke. The people could not believe that she would still not speak the guilty man's name, after the minister's emotional request, or else that the guilty one himself would not speak.</p>

	<p>Hester refused to speak.</p>

	<p>"Woman, do not continue to anger God and the people of this town!" cried Minister Wilson, more rudely than before. "Speak out the name of that baby's father! That scarlet letter will then be removed from your chest."</p>

	<p>"Never!" replied Hester Prynne, looking into the eyes of the young Minister Dimmesdale, who looked quite troubled. "The letter is permanent; there is no way to remove it, or its pain."</p>

	<p>"Speak, woman!" said another voice, coldly. "Speak and give your child a father!"</p>

	<p>"I will not speak!" answered Hester, turning pale. "My child's only father is God. She shall never know another father!"</p>

	<p>"She will not speak!" whispered Mr Dimmesdale, looking rather weak.</p>

	<p>She was then returned to the prison with her child. Many said that the scarlet letter shone brightly as she entered the dark hall of the prison.</p>
