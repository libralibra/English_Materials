	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER FOURTEEN</p>

	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">Phineas Fogg Travels the Length of the Ganges River and Does Not Think to Look at It</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">T</span>he job was done. Passepartout laughed for an hour at his success. Sir Francis shook his hand, and his master said, "Well done!" Passepartout said that it was Mr Fogg's success. He only had a strange idea. Passepartout laughed again, thinking that for a few moments he had been a prince and husband to a beautiful woman. The woman was still asleep.</p>

	<p>The elephant was moving quickly through the forest. They stopped at seven o'clock. The driver made the woman drink some water, but she was still mostly asleep. Sir Francis knew about the drugs she had been given, and was not worried. He was worried, though, that if Aouda remained in India she would be captured again. She would only be safe by leaving India forever.</p>

	<p>Phineas Fogg said he would think about the matter.</p>

	<p>They reached Allahabad about ten o'clock, and they would be able to reach Calcutta in less than twenty-four hours. Phineas Fogg would be able to take the steamer to Hong Kong the next day, October 25th, at noon.</p>

	<p>Passepartout was told to buy some supplies for the woman, so he walked around the city. He wanted to get a good look at Allahabad, also known as the City of God. He bought a dress and a few other things and returned to the station.</p>

	<p>The drugs given by the Priests began' to wear off, and Aouda's eyes returned to normal. She was a charming woman, and she spoke English perfectly.</p>

	<p>The train was about to start from Allahabad, and Mr Fogg paid the guide the exact price, and nothing more. Passepartout was astonished. The guide had helped his master so much, and he still had to fear the Indians. Something had to be done about Kiouni, too.</p>

	<p>Phineas Fogg had already determined the answer.</p>

	<p>"Parsee," he said, "you have done very well. I have paid for your service, but not for your devotion. Would you like to have this elephant? He is yours."</p>

	<p>The driver's eyes shined.</p>

	<p>"You are giving me a fortune!" he cried.</p>

	<p>"Take him, guide," replied Mr Fogg, "and I will still owe you."</p>

	<p>Passepartout was very happy, and he fed Kiouni one last piece of sugar. The elephant lifted Passepartout up and held him close.</p>

	<p>Soon they were on the train. During the journey, the young woman fully recovered, and Sir Francis told her the story of her rescue. He talked about Phineas Fogg's courage, and he told about Passepartout's great idea. Mr Fogg said nothing, while Passepartout kept repeating that "it wasn't worth telling."</p>

	<p>Aouda thanked them, but she could not speak. Her eyes said very much while she cried. Then she thought about her current dangers, and she became afraid.</p>

	<p>Phineas Fogg understood her fear, and offered to take her to Hong Kong. There she could wait out the problem. She accepted, since she had a relative in Hong Kong. Although it is on a Chinese island, Hong Kong was wholly English.</p>

	<p>At half past twelve the train stopped at Benares. Benares was Sir Francis Cromarty's goal. He said goodbye to Phineas Fogg. He expressed hope that Mr Fogg would come to India another time as a regular traveler. Phineas Fogg lightly shook his hand. Aouda showed Sir Francis great warmth, and Passepartout shook his hand.</p>

	<p>The train passed along the Ganges River. Groups of Indians were praying in the sacred river. What would their Gods think about modern day India, with English steamboats going up and down the Ganges?</p>

	<p>Night came, and the train passed at full speed. They could hear tigers, bears, and wolves flee before the train.</p>

	<p>They reached Calcutta at seven in the morning, and the ship left for Hong Kong&#151;at noon. Phineas Fogg had five hours before him.</p>

	<p>In his journal, he was due at Calcutta on the 25th of October, and that was the exact date of his actual arrival. He was neither running behind nor ahead of time. The two days gained between London and Bombay had been lost in the journey across India. But Phineas Fogg did not regret them.</p>
