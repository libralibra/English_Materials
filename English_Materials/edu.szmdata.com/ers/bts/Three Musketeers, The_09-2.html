	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER NINE</p>

	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">Making the Trap</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">A</span> week later the Cardinal received a letter:</p>

	<blockquote class="letter">

	<p>I have the diamonds, but I do not have enough money to leave London. Send me five hundred gold pieces; once I receive the money I shall immediately come to Paris.</p>

	<p class="r">MILADY</p>

	</blockquote>

	<p>The Cardinal sent Milady the money and then went at once to the see the King. He talked for a while about some money affairs, and then, a little carefully, said: "My King, perhaps the Queen would be pleased if you had a party in her honor. You know how much she enjoys dancing."</p>

	<p>"A dancing party?" said the King, quite surprised at the Cardinal's suggestion, "But I hate dancing!"</p>

	<p>"Then, My King, I believe the Queen will be even more pleased if you arrange one especially for her. A party will give her an opportunity to wear that beautiful diamond sash which you gave her for her birthday."</p>

	<p>"Perhaps it is a good idea," said the King, "When should we have this party?"</p>

	<p>The Cardinal thought silently for a moment and said. "The 3rd of October, I think, My King, would be an excellent day."</p>

	<p>"Very well," said the King, "I will go and see the Queen at once."</p>

	<p>The Queen was sitting alone in her room, and the King told her about the plan for the party.</p>

	<p>"What a wonderful idea, my King!" she began, "I do truly love dancing."</p>

	<p>"During the evening of this party," he said, "I wish you to wear the diamond sash I gave you on your birthday."</p>

	<p>The Queen became pale and looked at her husband with great fear in her eyes. The King saw this, but did not understand why.</p>

	<p>"When is the party?" asked the Queen.</p>

	<p>"Soon, my love, I will ask Cardinal Richelieu."</p>

	<p>"Oh, it was the Cardinal, then, who wanted me to wear my diamond sash to the party?"</p>

	<p>"Yes&#151;the Cardinal had suggested it."</p>

	<p>The King then left the room. She fell on to her bed, put her head down on her pillow, and began to cry. What was she going to do?</p>

	<p>"May I help you, my Queen?" said a soft voice.</p>

	<p>The Queen turned around and saw Constance Bonacieux standing behind her, who had heard everything that the King had said.</p>

	<p>"Do not be afraid Madame," Constance said. "I think I can help you in your trouble."</p>

	<p>"Tell me truly," said the Queen, reaching out her hand, "Can I trust you to help me?"</p>

	<p>"Yes, Madame," the young woman said as she fell down to her knees, "I am prepared to die for My Queen! We must get back the diamond sash. My Queen gave it to the Duke of Buckingham, did you not? We must send someone to see the Duke. I will find someone to go. Write a letter to the Duke and I promise that it will be delivered. I will give your letter to my uncle. He often travels on business and no one would think that he would be carrying a letter of his Queen. In fact, I can put the letter in his things and he will not even know that he is carrying it."</p>

	<p>"I will trust you to help me then," said the Queen. She ran over to a little table on which there were pens and paper. She wrote a note quickly and then closed the letter.</p>

	<p>"You will need money for this trip, also," she said, pulling at a ring on her finger. "Take this ring. I believe it is worth a lot of money. Sell it, and have your uncle go immediately."</p>

	<p>"I will have done it within an hour."</p>

	<p>Constance left the palace and within ten minutes was at her uncle's house.</p>

	<p>"Uncle, I need your help." Constance said.</p>

	<p>"Did you know," he cried, "that I have just spent two days and nights in prison?"</p>

	<p>"Yes, uncle, a short time like that passes quickly," she said without caring. "I need you to do something important for me. Do not worry, you will be paid well for it."</p>

	<p>Bonacieux's eyes became bright with excitement. "How much?" he asked.</p>

	<p>"I don't know exactly, a thousand gold pieces, perhaps. Now, listen to me carefully, uncle&#151;this is what you must do. You must leave Paris at once. I will give you an important paper that you must not lose, and which you will deliver to a man."</p>

	<p>"Where do I need to go?"</p>

	<p>"London."</p>

	<p>"London? You are joking with me! I have no business in London."</p>

	<p>"But now you do have business there. The person who wants you to go is&#151;is a very famous person."</p>

	<p>"I see!" cried Bonacieux, "More of your crazy plans! The Cardinal has told me about all your wild ideas and trouble making."</p>

	<p>"The Cardinal!" Constance said in shock, staring hard at her uncle. "Have you gone to see the Cardinal?"</p>

	<p>"Yes, he sent for me," replied her uncle proudly, "He called me his friend."</p>

	<p>"Are you working for the Cardinal now?" whispered Constance.</p>

	<p>"Yes&#151;and I am very well paid for it," replied Bonacieux, pulling out the bag of gold that the Cardinal gave him and showing it to his niece.</p>

	<p>Constance became very worried about having told her uncle so much, so she tried to hide her thoughts. "Perhaps you are right, uncle," she said. "It is better to work for the great Cardinal than for the Queen. Forget my crazy idea."</p>

	<p>"Aren't you going to tell me what I need to do in London?" replied her uncle, wanting to hear some interesting news.</p>

	<p>"Oh, it was really nothing important," said Constance. "It was just about buying some things&#151;things that only interest women."</p>

	<p>The more Constance tried to stop talking, the more important her uncle thought her secret was. He decided to go quickly to tell the Cardinal that the Queen was looking for somebody to take a letter to London. He said goodbye to Constance, and ran off as fast as his small legs would move him.</p>

	<p>"What shall I do now?" cried Constance.</p>

	<p>A moment later, as there came a knock on the ceiling and Constance jumped up in fear. "Who is that?" she yelled up.</p>

	<p>A voice came through the ceiling. It said, "Madam Bonacieux, please open the door in the street for me and I will come down and see you."</p>

	<p>Constance thought about the voice for a moment and a look of hope came to her eyes. It was the voice of d'Artagnan!</p>
