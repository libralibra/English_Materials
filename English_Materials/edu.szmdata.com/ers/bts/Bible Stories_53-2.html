	<p class="storyTitle">53. Giving up Possessions</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">A</span> man had an important question to ask Jesus. He came running up to him and fell down on his knees.</p>

	<p>"Good teacher, what must I do to have eternal life?" he asked.</p>

	<p>"You know what the commandments are," Jesus said to him. "Do not commit adultery, don't kill or steal, don't lie or cheat, and show honor for your mother and father."</p>

	<p>The man shook his head eagerly. "Yes, teacher. I have kept all these commandments since I was young."</p>

	<p>Jesus looked at the man. He felt love and kindness for him because he was a good man.</p>

	<p>"There is one thing you must do," Jesus told him. "You must sell all that you own and give the money to the poor. Then you can follow me and have a great treasure waiting for you in heaven."</p>

	<p>The man was sad because he was very rich and had many possessions. He turned away from Jesus and went on his way.</p>

	<p>The disciples were amazed by what Jesus told them about riches. He said that it was very hard for a rich man to have eternal life. "It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than it is for a rich man to enter God's kingdom."</p>

	<p>Jesus sat with his disciples near the temple's entrance. They watched people pass by and place money in the collection plate. Many rich people came by and tossed in handfuls of gold coins.</p>

	<p>A poor old woman placed two small coins in the plate. Jesus called his disciples over to him.</p>

	<p>"That poor widow has put more into the plate than all the other people put together," he said.</p>

	<p>Jesus saw that his disciples did not understand him, so he explained what he meant.</p>

	<p>"Those rich people put in only a little of their great wealth," he said. "But that woman put in all she had. To her, God is more important them money."</p>
