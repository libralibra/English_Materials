	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER FIVE</p>

	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">Sensitivity</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">A</span>fter six months with the marquis, Julien was trusted to handle most of his business. Marquis de la Mole signed almost every letter Julien wrote for him. The marquis gave him a horse, and Julien practiced almost every day.</p>

	<p>Julien continued to study religion, and Father Pirard introduced him to several Jansenist societies. Julien admired these men; they were not liars like other people in the church, and they never thought about money. At one society he met Count Altamira, who had been sentenced to death. He was religious and he loved freedom; this surprised Julien.</p>

	<p>Count Norbert stopped being friendly to Julien. He thought Julien was too sensitive. Julien spent his free time practicing shooting a gun, learning to use a sword, and riding horses.</p>

	<p>The salons of Paris were different from the small towns. Julien's pride was never hurt in the salon, but no one cared about him here.</p>
