	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER THIRTEEN</p>

	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">New Shoes</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">J</span>ulien had not thought about Mrs de R&#x00EA;nal for three days. "She treats me like a worker's son", he thought, "But she's so beautiful."</p>

	<p>Mrs Derville had been watching her friend. Mrs de R&#x00EA;nal usually dressed plainly, but she bought new shoes from Paris and Elisa made her a new dress. Mrs Derville knew that her friend was in love.</p>

	<p>Mrs de R&#x00EA;nal asked Julien about his trip. She was very nervous, but finally she asked, "Will you leave us to teach somewhere else?"</p>

	<p>When she spoke Julien knew, too. "She's in love with me", he said to himself. But only right now. Soon her pride will return.</p>

	<p>"It will be hard to leave, but it might be necessary," he said.</p>

	<p>When the group sat in the garden that night, Julien took her hand again and softly kissed it many times. After some time he forgot about her hand and let it go. Mrs de R&#x00EA;nal was so afraid of losing him that she reached out and took his hand. This surprised Julien so much that he decided, "I must become this woman's lover." This idea was another battle for Julien, not an act of love. He wanted another victory.</p>

	<p>She whispered, "Will you leave us?"</p>

	<p>"I must leave, because I love you," he said, "and it's a sin for a young priest!"</p>

	<p>That night was very different for the two. Mrs de R&#x00EA;nal was happier than ever before. A woman who falls in love early gets used to love's changes, but this innocent woman didn't know anything about love.</p>
