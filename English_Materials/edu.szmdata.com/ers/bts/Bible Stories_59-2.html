	<p class="storyTitle">59. Judas Sells out</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">J</span>udas Iscariot was one of Jesus' disciples. He was not as loyal and faithful as the others. He still believed in his heart that money was the most important thing on earth.</p>

	<p>When Lazarus' sister, Mary, poured expensive perfume on Jesus' feet, it made Judas very angry. He told Jesus they should sell the perfume to get money for the poor. But since Judas took care of the money, he thought he could put some aside for himself.</p>

	<p>Judas knew the Jewish priests and Pharisees wanted to lay a trap for Jesus. He figured they would pay a high price to get their hands on him. So he went to the priests at night and asked what they would pay to have Jesus brought to them.</p>

	<p>"We will give you thirty pieces of silver," the priests said.</p>

	<p>That was a lot of money, so Judas planned how he could turn over Jesus to the priests.</p>

	<p>It was time for the disciples to prepare the meal they would serve for the Passover Feast. "Where will we have our Passover meal?" the disciples asked Jesus.</p>

	<p>"Go into the city and look for a man carrying a pitcher of water," he said. "Follow him back to the house and ask to see the owner. Ask him which room the Master will use during the Passover meal."</p>

	<p>The disciples did as Jesus told them to do. When they found the man's house, he showed them a large room upstairs that was already set up with tables and chairs. They found everything they needed to fix the unleavened bread and other food that was a part of the Passover dinner.</p>

	<p>That evening Jesus arrived at the house to celebrate the Passover with his disciples. After they sat down, Jesus said something that disturbed them very much.</p>

	<p>"One of you sitting at this table will turn me in to my enemies," he said.</p>

	<p>The disciples looked at each other. They couldn't believe one of them would betray Jesus. This made them sad. Later that evening Jesus took the bread that was on the table and broke it into little pieces. "This is my body," he said. "Take it."</p>

	<p>Then he passed his cup around the room and told each disciple to drink from it. "This is my blood that is shed for many people," he said. "I want you to drink it and remember me."</p>

	<p>After dinner, Jesus got up from the table. He took off the robe he was wearing over his clothes. Then he took a towel and tied it around his waist.</p>

	<p>The disciples wondered what Jesus planned to do. He took a bowl of water, set it on the floor, and started to wash the disciples' feet.</p>

	<p>Peter spoke up. "You will never wash my feet," he said.</p>

	<p>"That is servant's work and you are our master."</p>

	<p>But Jesus told him they should learn something from what he was doing.</p>

	<p>"If I do not wash your feet, then you will not be a part of me," he said. "You should wash one another's feet as I have washed yours. I have given you an example of how you should treat one another. You should be good to one another the same way I have been good to each one of you.</p>

	<p>"If you have learned this lesson and follow it from now on, you will live in peace and happiness with one another."</p>

	<p>John wanted to know which disciple planned to betray Jesus. He leaned over to Jesus and whispered in his ear.</p>

	<p>"Lord, who is it?" he said.</p>

	<p>"I will hand this bread to that person," Jesus told John. Then he took the bread and handed it to Judas.</p>

	<p>"Go now and do what you must do," Jesus said to Judas.</p>

	<p>No one knew what Jesus meant. They thought that Jesus had sent Judas out to get food and drink for the feast.</p>

	<p>"Now God will be glorified," Jesus said to the others. Then he told them he was getting ready to go away to a place where they could not come.</p>

	<p>"I want to go with you," Peter cried out. "You know I would do anything for you."</p>

	<p>"Is that true?" Jesus said. "I tell you now that before the cock crows today you will deny that you know me three times."</p>
