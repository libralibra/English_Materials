	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">A</span> couple of days later, a letter arrived from Alcee Arobin, expressing how sorry he was for his behavior. Edna felt a little ashamed for having gotten so angry with him. After all, he had done nothing more than kiss her hand, which was quite common among men and women in society. She decided to send him a letter in return. It was a very funny letter that indicated she had completely forgiven him. She suggested that he visit her painting room anytime that he wished.</p>

	<p>Alcee Arobin showed up at her home almost immediately after receiving her letter. And from then on, he was there almost every day. He was always in a good mood and would do anything that she wanted without ever objecting. He was like a little puppy dog that never stopped wanting to be around its master, even if the master was unfriendly to it. Edna, however, was seldom unfriendly. They became very close friends, but there was always a sexual desire between them. Arobin would occasionally express this desire in little childish ways, which Edna did not mind. She enjoyed letting that part of her imagination go free from time to time.</p>

	<p>Spending time at Ms Reisz's could make Edna calm down. That woman's piano playing had the ability to touch even the deepest areas of Edna's person.</p>

	<p>Edna went there one depressing, rainy afternoon. Ms Reisz was happy to see her and offered her a drink to warm her up a bit. After throwing a glass of whiskey down her throat, like a man might do, Edna suddenly said, "I'm moving out."</p>

	<p>"Hmm. Where will you go?" Ms Reisz asked without seeming surprised.</p>

	<p>"Very near, actually. There's a little home down the street from here. I don't want to have to deal with all of those servants anymore. It's all so troublesome."</p>

	<p>"Well, I don't believe that's the real reason for your moving."</p>

	<p>"Ah, I see that I can't lie to you very easily. Well, alright. I'm moving because I have the ability to support myself now. I won a good amount of money this year at the racetrack and my father's been sending me money, as well. Not to mention, my paintings have started to sell. Anyway, I plan to move into the little home with only one servant to help me get by. I've already found someone."</p>

	<p>"And your husband?"</p>

	<p>"He doesn't know yet. Of course it'll all sound crazy to him. What about you? Do you think it's crazy?"</p>

	<p>"I still don't understand why you're doing it," answered Ms Reisz.</p>

	<p>Edna only knew that she no longer wanted to belong to any man. She wanted to be independent. She knew that this would be hard to explain to her husband.</p>

	<p>After a while, Ms Reisz brought out a letter and gave it to Edna. Edna was surprised and excited. "Does he know that you let me read his letters?"</p>

	<p>"Are you kidding? He'd never write me again if he did! It's obvious that the boy is in love with you. He writes me because a relationship with you is impossible. He's clearly trying to get rid of his feelings but cannot."</p>

	<p>She read while Ms Reisz played for her. Suddenly, she jumped up from her seat and ran over to Ms Reisz, shouting: "How could you keep such a secret? He is returning! When? He only says 'very soon' in the letter!"</p>

	<p>"And that is all I know. Tell me, are you in love with Robert, Edna?"</p>

	<p>"I am," Edna answered without any hesitation. It was the first time she had ever said it aloud.</p>

	<p>"What's your plan for his coming back?"</p>

	<p>"I don't have one, except to be happy once again!"</p>

	<p>Her happiness had already begun. She ran home laughing in the same rain that had, just a few hours before, so upset her.</p>

	<p>She stopped at a candy store and bought lots of candy to send to her boys in Iberville. And when she got home, she wrote her husband a very nice letter about her plans to move into another home for a short time. There was nothing of her sadness or anger in the letter. It was full of nothing but her hopes for the future.</p>
