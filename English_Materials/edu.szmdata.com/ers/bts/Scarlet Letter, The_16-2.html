	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER SIXTEEN</p>

	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">A Forest Walk</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">H</span>ester Prynne had remembered her promise to tell Mr Dimmesdale of the relation between herself and the minister's close doctor friend. For several days, however, she had found no opportunity to speak to him until she found him on a walk near the sea, as he often did. She had not wanted to find him at his home, as Roger Chillingworth would surely be nearby. One day, Hester took young Pearl to walk near the seashore to find the minister.</p>

	<p>"Mother," said little Pearl, "the sunshine does not love you. It runs away and hides from you, because it is afraid of something on your chest. There is sunshine over there, but when you stand within the light, it leaves. Let me run and catch it. I am just a child. It will not run from me; for I wear nothing on my chest yet!"</p>

	<p>"And you never will wear anything on your chest, I hope," said Hester.</p>

	<p>"And why not, Mother?" asked Pearl, stopping. "Won't the scarlet letter appear on my chest one day when I am a grown woman?"</p>

	<p>"Run away, child," answered her mother, "and catch the sunshine! It will soon be gone."</p>

	<p>And the child ran away to chase the sunshine. Hester watched her young child with a smile.</p>

	<p>"Come, my child!" said Hester, "we will sit down and rest."</p>

	<p>"I am not tired, Mother," replied the little girl. "But you may sit down, if you will tell me a story."</p>

	<p>"A story, child!" said Hester. "And about what?"</p>

	<p>"Oh, a story about the Black Man," answered Pearl. "How he walks through the forest, and carries a big, ugly book, and asks everybody he meets to write their names with their own blood in his book. And then he puts a mark on their chests. Have you ever met the Black Man, Mother?"</p>

	<p>"And who told you this story, Pearl?" asked her mother, recognizing the story.</p>

	<p>"It was an old woman, at the house where you watched last night," said the child. "The old woman believed I was asleep while she was talking of it. She said that a thousand people had met him to write their names in his book. And that old Mistress Hibbins was one who had signed his book. And, Mother, the old woman said that this scarlet letter was the Black Man's mark on you. Is it true, Mother? And do you meet him during the night?"</p>

	<p>"Did you ever wake during the night without your mother next to you?" asked Hester.</p>

	<p>"No," said the child. "If you do not fear leaving the cottage at night, I would like you to take me there. I would very gladly go! But Mother, tell me now! Is there such a Black Man? And did you ever meet him? And is this his mark?"</p>

	<p>"Will you stop asking me such questions if I tell you?"</p>

	<p>"Yes, if you tell me all," answered Pearl.</p>

	<p>"Once in my life I met the Black Man!" said her mother. "This scarlet letter is his mark!"</p>

	<p>They sat down together for a short time, the child amusing herself with a small stream of water nearby. Hester then saw the minister walking.</p>

	<p>"Go and play, child," the mother told her child.</p>

	<p>"Yes, Mother," answered Pearl. "But if it is the Black Man, will you take me away?"</p>

	<p>"Go, silly child!" said her mother, impatiently. "It is no Black Man! You cannot see him now, it is the minister!"</p>

	<p>"And so it is!" said the child. "And, Mother, he has his hand over his heart! Is it because, when the minister wrote his name in the book, the Black Man marked his chest, as well? But why does he not wear it outside on his clothing, as you do, Mother?"</p>

	<p>"Go now, child, but do not go far."</p>

	<p>The child went singing away, near the stream. When the strange child had left, Hester Prynne had walked closer to the minister. She saw the minister walking alone. He looked nervous and weak after so many years of quiet pain and suffering.</p>
