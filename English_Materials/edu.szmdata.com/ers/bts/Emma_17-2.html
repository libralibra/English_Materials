	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">I</span>n a few days, the weather improved, and the Knightleys soon returned to London. On the evening of their departure, a note from Mr Elton was brought to Mr Woodhouse. Mr Elton was leaving Highbury the following morning to visit some friends for a few weeks. Emma was happily surprised. Her name was not mentioned in the note once, however. She now decided to explain to Harriet what had happened. The next day, she went to see Harriet, and told her the story. Seeing Harriet so hurt made Emma realize she should never again persuade her friend to fall in love.</p>

Time, Emma believed, must be allowed for Harriet to forget her love for Mr Elton. Emma knew the three would meet each other in Highbury, and they must be polite. Mr Elton was loved at Mrs Goddard's school, where Harriet lived. The teachers spoke of him often, so Harriet would have difficulties in forgetting Mr Elton. There could be no true peace in Harriet's heart.</p>
