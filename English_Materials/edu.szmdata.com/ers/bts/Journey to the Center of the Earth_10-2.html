	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER TEN</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">D</span>inner was ready. My uncle ate a great deal, as he had eaten very little during our sea voyage from Copenhagen. The conversation during the meal, between my uncle and our host, was in Icelandic, but my uncle occasionally gave me a German translation, and our host, a Latin one. They discussed scientific matters. My uncle, however, said very little, refusing to say anything about our plans to travel to the center of the Earth.</p>

	<p>First, our host, Mr Fridriksson, asked my uncle if he enjoyed his visit to the library.</p>

	<p>"The library!" the professor exclaimed. "There's nothing but a few old books on almost empty shelves."</p>

	<p>"What!" Mr Fridriksson said. "We have eight thousand books, many of them are rare and valuable. We also have many new books that are sent to us from Copenhagen every year."</p>

	<p>"Where do you keep those eight thousand books? I couldn't see&#160;...&#160;"</p>

	<p>"They're all over the country, Mr Lidenbrock. The people of our old icy island love to study. There's not one farmer or fisherman who doesn't know how to read, and all of them do read. We feel that books should not be kept on shelves, but should be read. Our people will read the books, then pass them on to others to read. The books often don't return to the library for a year or two."</p>

	<p>"And during that time," my uncle said, looking annoyed, "foreigners&#160;...&#160;"</p>

	<p>"What do you mean? Foreigners have libraries in their own countries. Our peasants must be able to educate themselves. As I've said, Icelanders love to study. Now, if you tell me which books you hoped to find in our library, I may be able to give you some information about them."</p>

	<p>I looked at my uncle. He paused before he answered. After thinking awhile, however, he decided to speak.</p>

	<p>"I wanted to know if you have any books written by Arne Saknussemm."</p>

	<p>"Arne Saknussemm? Are you talking about the great sixteenth century scientist, who was also a great traveler?"</p>

	<p>"Exactly."</p>

	<p>"A man who had both courage and intelligence."</p>

	<p>"Yes, he certainly did. Well, what about his books?"</p>

	<p>"Ah, his books. We don't have them."</p>

	<p>"What! You don't have them here in Iceland?"</p>

	<p>"They aren't in Iceland, nor are they anywhere else in the world."</p>

	<p>"Why not?"</p>

	<p>"Because the government declared Arne Saknussemm to be insane. In 1573, his books were burned in Copenhagen."</p>

	<p>"Good! Wonderful!" cried my uncle.</p>

	<p>Mr Fridriksson was shocked.</p>

	<p>"What do you mean?" asked the Icelandic scientist.</p>

	<p>"Yes, I understand everything now. He was forced to hide his discoveries he'd made, and he had to use a secret code&#160;...&#160;"</p>

	<p>"What secret?" Mr Fridriksson asked with a bit of anger in his voice.</p>

	<p>"A secret that&#160;...&#160;"</p>

	<p>"Do you have some special document?"</p>

	<p>"No, I&#160;... I was only thinking of such possibilities."</p>

	<p>"Very well," said Mr Fridriksson, asking nothing more about it. "Mr Lidenbrock, I hope you will explore our island before leaving. There are many mountains and volcanoes that still need to be studied because very little is known about them. You see that mountain," he said as he pointed into the distance, "That's Sneffels."</p>

	<p>"Ah, Sneffels&#160;...&#160;"</p>

	<p>"It's one of our most interesting volcanoes, yet people seldom visit it."</p>

	<p>"Well, then," my uncle said, trying to hide his eagerness. "I'd like to begin my studies with Seffels&#160;... Fessels&#160;... What's the name again?"</p>

	<p>"Sneffels," Mr Fridriksson replied calmly. "Yes, the volcano has been dead for the past five hundred years."</p>

	<p>"Yes, what you have said has made me decide that we'll try to climb that Sneffels to study," my uncle responded with great excitement. "We'll take a boat across to get there. That's the quickest way."</p>

	<p>"It would be, but there are no boats in Reykjavik."</p>

	<p>"Not a single one?"</p>

	<p>"That's right. You'll have to go by land. It will be longer, but more interesting. I know someone who can guide you there."</p>

	<p>"A responsible, intelligent man?"</p>

	<p>"Yes, he lives nearby. He makes his living by hunting. You'll be pleased with him. He speaks Danish quite well."</p>

	<p>"When can I see him?"</p>

	<p>"Tomorrow, if you'd like."</p>

	<p>"Why not today?"</p>

	<p>"Because he won't be here till tomorrow."</p>

	<p>"Well, tomorrow, then," my uncle said, looking disappointed.</p>

	<p>The conversation between the German professor and the Icelandic professor soon ended. My uncle was quite pleased with his findings. He had discovered the reason for the mysterious document and the story of Saknussemm.</p>
