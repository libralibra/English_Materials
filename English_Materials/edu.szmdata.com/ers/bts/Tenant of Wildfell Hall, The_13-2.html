	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER THIRTEEN</p>

	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">A Return to Duty</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">"M</span>y dear Gilbert! I wish you would try to be a little more friendly," said my mother, one morning. "You say there is nothing the matter with you, but you have changed in the past few days."</p>

	<p>I picked up a book nearby, and pretended to read with great interest. I soon remembered that I had to speak with Robert Wilson about buying a piece of land near our farm. After breakfast, I quickly stood up and left for the Wilsons'. As I walked, I was wishing that Jane Wilson and her mother would not be home when I arrived, as I did not want to discuss Mrs Graham with them.</p>

	<p>I arrived, but Robert was out. He was to return shortly, however. Mrs Wilson asked me to wait in the sitting room. As I walked in, I was disappointed to see Miss Wilson talking with Eliza Millward. I had not seen Eliza since our last dinner party. She was cheerful, however. Although, I could see in her eyes that I was not forgiven for taking an interest in another woman.</p>

	<p>Miss Wilson was friendly; she and Eliza talked a great deal, and I listened patiently, not wanting to speak myself. But Eliza soon asked me if I had seen Mrs Graham lately.</p>

	<p>"Not lately," I replied carelessly, but sternly. "What! Are you tired of her already?"</p>

	<p>"I would rather not speak of her now."</p>

	<p>"Ah! So you finally know that you were mistaken in your great opinion of her."</p>

	<p>"Miss Eliza, I desire you not to speak of her."</p>

	<p>"Oh, pardon me! I see you have been hurt deeply by love, and have not recovered!" she said with a smile.</p>

	<p>I stood up to leave, but soon remembered that if I did, the two foolish girls would only be more amused. I then walked to the window, and looked out in silence. Mr Wilson soon arrived, and we sat down to discuss our business. Soon after, I left to return home. As I was walking near Wildfell Hall, I saw Mrs Graham and her son walking down the hill. I immediately turned in another direction, and soon heard a young child screaming my name. I continued walking quickly, but turned around to see if the two were still behind me. They were gone.</p>

	<p>This incident upset me greatly. I was still deeply in love with Mrs Graham and quite fond of her child. The rest of the day, I was more miserable than before.</p>
