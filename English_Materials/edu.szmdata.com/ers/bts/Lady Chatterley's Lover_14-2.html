	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER FOURTEEN</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">T</span>hat morning, Connie found a letter from her sister, Hilda, waiting for her on the dining room table. It said that she would be arriving at Wragby on Thursday, the 17th, and that Connie should be ready to go. Hilda did not want to see Clifford.</p>

	<p>The idea of Connie going to Venice made Clifford feel quite horrible. He liked her being around. Her presence comforted him and allowed him to concentrate on his work with the coalmines. Every day, he would talk with her about his plans for the mines and then he would turn on the radio and sit for hours, listening and thinking up more plans. At night, he did nothing but play cards with Mrs Bolton, who seemed to enjoy the games, even though she lost every single time. All of this made Clifford seem more and more dead to Connie.</p>

	<p>"I'm leaving on the seventeenth," she said to him, "and I'll be back by the twentieth of July."</p>

	<p>"Now, you're sure you will return?" Clifford asked her, "I mean, you won't just run away and never come back, will you?"</p>

	<p>"Of course not!"</p>

	<p>Clifford had mixed feelings. He wanted her to go and get pregnant, but he also feared that she might fall in love with someone and leave him.</p>

	<p>Connie, of course, did want to leave him, but she knew that this was not yet the right time. She discussed her plans with the gamekeeper.</p>

	<p>"When I return from Venice, I'll tell Clifford that I'm leaving him and then you and I can go far away from here. I asked my father and he told me that I'll receive six hundred pounds every year. Maybe we could go to another country?"</p>

	<p>"Yes, but we both should divorce our spouses first, don't you think?" he said.</p>

	<p>"Yes, of course."</p>

	<p>But how difficult a task that seemed to Connie.</p>

	<p>Her thoughts then wandered back to the gamekeeper and his life before Wragby. She asked him how he had liked being a soldier in the English Army.</p>

	<p>"I liked my leader, but then he died and I almost died with him."</p>

	<p>"Weren't you supposed to become an officer in the army?" she asked.</p>

	<p>"Yes. I could have, but let me tell you, the other officers were all a bunch of ladies without balls, who thought that they knew everything there was to know in the world! And that's how most of the middle class people are these days! I hate every one of them! In fact, I think everyone is becoming this way in the world. They're all turning into machine-loving idiots! Give them another ten thousand years and, I promise you, there won't be any people left on this earth. They'll have killed each other completely, because they're starting to feel less and less."</p>

	<p>"If you believe this, then what do you think about having a child?"</p>

	<p>The gamekeeper suddenly looked down at the ground.</p>

	<p>"Yes, I don't like the idea of bringing a child into this horrible world."</p>

	<p>"Oh, please don't talk like that!" Connie cried, "I think that I'm pregnant now with your child! If you don't want it, then you'll never really want me either!"</p>

	<p>He said nothing. She felt that he was a little upset because she was going away to Venice. She liked it that he was jealous. Quickly, she went over to him and put her hands under his shirt and into his pants. She took his balls and penis into her hands and gently held them.</p>

	<p>"Please, say that you want the child!" she said.</p>

	<p>"Well, sometimes I do have the desire to tell the people of Tevershall, 'Look at yourselves! What's happened to you all? Stop working for money, for it's only made you ugly and unhappy! We could destroy Tevershall and rebuild it with beautiful buildings and homes!' That's my hope. My dream."</p>

	<p>The whole time he was saying this, Connie was putting little flowers in the hair around his penis. She was admiring the four different colors of hair that he had all around his body: dark and light red, and dark and light brown, all in different areas.</p>

	<p>Then she heard the sound of heavy rain coming down outside and she had the sudden desire to run out into it. She pulled her gown over her head and ran down the stairs and out the door into the rain. The gamekeeper went to the front door and watched as she danced about in the grass. He then took all of his clothing off and ran out after her. Connie ran from him into the woods. As the gamekeeper came closer and closer to her, he could feel himself wanting her more and more. When finally he caught up with her, he took hold of her from behind and forced her to the muddy ground on her hands and knees. Then he grabbed her buttocks, pulled them toward him, and entered her. She felt warm inside. He fucked her like an animal and came to his climax very quickly.</p>

	<p>He then pulled Connie to her feet and they ran, together, back into his home, where they could sit in front of the warm fire and dry themselves.</p>

	<p>Inside, as Connie was drying her hair in front of the fire, the gamekeeper took a good look at her shapely body. He placed his hand on her back and moved it along her spine, all the way down to her round buttocks.</p>

	<p>"You have a wonderful ass. I'd say that you have the most beautiful ass in the world. The kind of ass a real man wants, a real ass!"</p>

	<p>As he said this, he touched her two holes.</p>

	<p>"And here's where you shit and piss! I like it that you can shit and piss. There's no shame in that. Yes, this is a real ass for a real man."</p>

	<p>Connie moved toward him, sat on his lap, and asked him to kiss her. The gamekeeper then took some flowers from the table and started to put them in the hair between her legs.</p>

	<p>"Now that's where these flowers belong," he said.</p>

	<p>"Yes, it's very pretty down there."</p>

	<p>Then she looked up into the gamekeeper's face, where the light of the fire reflected a beautiful yellow and orange.</p>

	<p>"Does it bother you that I'm going away?" she asked, "You know that I'm only going so that I can find an easy way to leave Clifford, right?"</p>

	<p>"But he thinks you're coming back."</p>

	<p>"Oh, I will return. I must. But I'm not coming back to him. I'm coming back to you. When I return, we can make our plans to go away."</p>

	<p>"How?" asked the gamekeeper, looking a little upset and disbelieving.</p>

	<p>"What's wrong? Don't you trust me? Don't you think it'd be better for me to get away from Wragby for a while?"</p>

	<p>"Oh, of course!" he said with anger in his voice.</p>

	<p>"I'm leaving on Thursday, you know."</p>

	<p>"Mm. I discussed my divorce with a lawyer the other day."</p>

	<p>"And&#160;...&#160;? What did he say?" Connie asked, a little surprised.</p>

	<p>"He said that it should be OK, as long as my wife doesn't cause any problems. I've got to behave well for the next six months, as well. So, maybe it's good that you'll be gone for a few weeks."</p>

	<p>"I want to sleep with you again before I leave. Let's plan to do it the night before I go. I'll arrange everything with my sister."</p>

	<p>"I don't know. That sounds pretty dangerous. It would be very easy for us to get caught."</p>

	<p>"No, not at all. I'll have Hilda bring me here in her car and pick me up early the next morning. I'll even wear a hat and glasses, so no one will recognize me in town."</p>

	<p>"Alright."</p>

	<p>"But, doesn't that make you happy?"</p>

	<p>"Yes, of course it does!" he said sadly, "I just worry a little, that's all."</p>

	<p>"Well, stop it!"</p>

	<p>The gamekeeper then ran out the door and into the woods. Connie watched as he disappeared into the trees. Her heart hurt from fear that he had angrily left the house. However, moments later, he reappeared with a lot of flowers in his arms. He came to where she was laying and began to cover her with the flowers, placing them around her breasts and down among the hairs between her legs. He then wrapped some around his penis and she put some in his chest hair.</p>

	<p>"This is all for the wedding of John Thomas and Lady Jane."</p>

	<p>They laughed together for a while and kissed one another playfully. Then it came time for Connie to go. The gamekeeper watched, as she got dressed.</p>

	<p>"I suppose that it's possible Lady Jane may find a man in Venice who will place flowers in her hair and feed her special fruits of the Mediterranean."</p>

	<p>"Don't say such things!"</p>

	<p>He didn't say anything after that. He just kissed her breasts, her belly, and the hair between her legs. And when she had finished dressing he walked her back to the entrance of the wood, near Wragby. There, they found Mrs Bolton in the park.</p>

	<p>"Why, there you are my Lady!" she cried, "We were starting to worry that something had happened to you!"</p>

	<p>The gamekeeper looked at her smiling.</p>

	<p>"Yes, here she is ma'am, safe as always. I'll be going now. Goodnight to you both!"</p>

	<p>And then he disappeared again into the woods.</p>
