	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER TWENTY</p>

	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">Pleasant Times</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">T</span>he weeks that followed were peaceful. Beth improved rapidly, and Mr March began to talk of returning early in the new year. Beth was soon able to lie on the sofa all day, amusing herself with her beloved cats. Jo carried her in her strong arms out every day for a short walk near the house. Meg cheerfully burned and blackened her white hands cooking for little Beth, while Amy celebrated her return by giving away as many of her treasured things as she could force her sisters to accept.</p>

	<p>As Christmas approached, Hannah declared that it was going to be an unusually fine day, and she proved herself to be right. To begin with, Mr March wrote that he should soon be with them, then Beth felt surprisingly well that morning, well enough to stand in front of the window to watch Jo and Laurie build a fantastic snow man in the yard, singing as she watched with delight. How Beth laughed when she saw it.</p>

	<p>"I'm so full of happiness, that, if Father was only here, I couldn't be happier," said Beth quietly.</p>

	<p>"So am I," added Jo.</p>

	<p>"I'm sure I am," cried Amy.</p>

	<p>"Of course I am!" cried Meg.</p>

	<p>"How can I not be?" said Mrs March gratefully, as her eyes went from her husband's letter to Beth's smiling face.</p>

	<p>Half an hour after everyone had said they were so happy, they received a gift to complete their happiness. Laurie opened the sitting room door, and walked in quietly, with a look of excitement on his face, saying, "Here's another Christmas present for the March family."</p>

	<p>Before he finished speaking, a tall man appeared in the arms of another tall man, who tried to say something. For the next several minutes, everybody gathered around Mr March joyously. Mr Brooke kissed Meg entirely by mistake, while Amy fell over a chair; and Jo nearly fainted away with excitement. Mrs March soon spoke with a warning, "Hush! Remember Beth!"</p>

	<p>But it was too late; the study door flew open, and the little girl appeared&#151;joy put strength into her weak body&#151;and Beth ran straight into her father's arms.</p>

	<p>Soon enough, the party sat down to eat. Mr March told them how he had longed to surprise them, and how, when the warm weather came, his doctor had allowed him to return home. He explained how Brooke had faithfully helped him, and was certain he was an honest, trustworthy young man.</p>

	<p>There was never such a Christmas dinner as they had that day. Mr Laurence and his grandson dined with them, also Mr Brooke&#151;at whom Jo gave angry looks, which greatly amused Laurie. Soon after the dinner, the guests left, and the girls remained gathered around their father.</p>

	<p>"Just a year ago we were complaining over the sad Christmas we expected to have. Do you remember?" asked Jo.</p>

	<p>"Rather a pleasant year we have had!" said Meg cheerfully.</p>

	<p>"I think it's been a pretty hard one," observed Amy.</p>

	<p>"I'm glad it's over, because we've got you back," whispered Beth.</p>

	<p>"You have had a difficult year, my dears, especially the end of it. But you have bravely done your duties," said Mr March.</p>

	<p>"How do you know? Did Mother tell you?" asked Jo.</p>

	<p>"Not much, but I've made several discoveries today."</p>

	<p>"Oh, tell us what they are!" cried Meg.</p>

	<p>"Here is one." And taking up her hands, Mr March pointed to the rough fingers and burned spots. "I remember a time when this hand was white and smooth, and your first care was to keep it that way. It was very pretty then, but to me it is much prettier now&#151;for it shows what work you have done for this family. Meg, my dear, I value the womanly skill that keeps this home happy more than white hands. I'm proud to shake this good little hand, and hope I shall not soon have to give it away to a husband." Meg was grateful for such kind words and approving smile.</p>

	<p>"What about Jo? She has been very, very good to me," said Beth.</p>

	<p>"Although she now has a rather boyish haircut, I don't see the 'son Jo' I left a year ago," said Mr March. "I see a young lady with proper manners and a more gentle voice. She now moves quietly, and takes care of a certain little person in a motherly way that delights me. And I know that I couldn't find anything beautiful enough to be bought with the twenty-five dollars my good girl sent me." Jo looked at her father with a sweet look at hearing such praise, feeling that she did deserve some of it.</p>

	<p>"Now Beth," said Amy, longing for her turn, but ready to wait.</p>

	<p>"My little Beth is not as shy as she used to be," began their father cheerfully, but remembering how close to death she once was, held her close, saying tenderly, "I've got you safe, my Beth, and I'll keep you so."</p>

	<p>After a minute's silence, he looked down at Amy, who sat near his feet, saying, "I observed that Amy took care of many duties for her mother today, gave Meg her seat tonight, and has waited on every one with patience. I also see that she does not worry as she used to, and has not even mentioned a very pretty ring that she wears. So, I must conclude that she has learned to think of other people more and of herself less. I am glad of this, for though I am very proud of my graceful girl, I am all the more proud of a lovable daughter with a talent for making life beautiful to herself and others."</p>
