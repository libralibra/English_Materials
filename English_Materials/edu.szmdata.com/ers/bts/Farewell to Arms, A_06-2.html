	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER SIX</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">T</span>he next day, after working in the mountains and visiting a medical camp full of wounded soldiers, I returned to the house at around five in the afternoon. I bathed and put on some clean clothes. Then I sat in the window and thought about writing my family back in the United States. The big fighting was supposed to begin the day after tomorrow. I would be sent to Plava to care for the wounded. I did not mention this in my letter though. This was a terrible place for war. We had no good leaders like Napoleon. The best we had was a handsome man in the third Italian Army. Sometimes I regretted not joining the British Army. It would have been less complicated, but it is almost certain that I would have died fighting with them. Here, I knew I was safe. The war could not hurt me. Besides, I think the Austrians would quit soon. I thought about all the places in Europe that I could go to, if this stupid war would just end. Then I thought about Catherine Barkley. I imagined us staying in a nice hotel in Milan. We would order expensive wine and drink it together while lying without clothes in bed.</p>

	<p>I had my dinner at the dining hall. The meal lasted longer than I had planned. The priest was there as usual, and some of the soldiers were trying to joke with him. They told him a story about a Priest in another town who was arrested for stealing money. The soldiers were idiots, but there was lots of wine, so I drank and listened to their foolish talk. Suddenly, I realized that I had had a bit too much to drink. Looking down at my watch, I saw that two hours had passed. I jumped up from my seat and told everyone that I had to go.</p>

	<p>I went straight to the British hospital and asked for Catherine. However, the receptionist told me that she could not come down.</p>

	<p>"Is there anything wrong?" I asked.</p>

	<p>"She is not feeling very well."</p>

	<p>I left the hospital feeling sad and alone. Up until now, I had not taken Catherine very seriously. But now, after a few drinks and being turned away at the hospital, I was really missing her.</p>

	<p>We found out the next day that the fighting was to begin later that evening. A couple of drivers and I would have to take some ambulances down the river to collect the wounded. On the way out of town, I stopped at the British hospital, and told the other drivers that I would meet them down the road. I then rushed into the waiting hall of the hospital and told them that I wanted to see Miss Barkley. After ten minutes, Catherine came down.</p>

	<p>"Are you feeling any better?" I asked.</p>

	<p>"I'm fine now. It was just too hot yesterday. I had to rest a bit."</p>

	<p>"I'm on my way to Plava now. There is supposed to be some fighting tonight. I won't be able to see you until tomorrow."</p>

	<p>She took off her necklace and gave it to me. There was a small figure hanging from it. "This is Saint Anthony. It can bring you good luck!"</p>

	<p>"Thanks. I'll keep it safe. I need to go now."</p>

	<p>"Please be very careful, and stay safe!"</p>

	<p>I ran out to the car and got in, holding tightly onto the Saint Anthony Catherine gave me. It was in a little, clear box. I took it out and looked at it carefully. "Saint Anthony!" the driver said, "I'm wearing one too. It works!"</p>

	<p>I put it around my neck and then forgot about it. A little later, when I got injured, I lost it. Somebody probably took it from me in one of the medical camps.</p>

	<p>We started to drive very fast to catch up with the other cars. After a while, we passed them. I sat in the car, looking outside at the beautiful Austrian mountains.</p>

	<p>About five minutes later, the road became wider and we saw the river that separated the Italian Army from the Austrians. Soon we came upon a hill. Down at the bottom was the village that we needed to take from the enemy.</p>
