	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER TEN</p>

	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">An Agreement and a Quarrel</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">W</span>hen the party was over and the guests had returned home, I was told that during the dinner party, the guests had all been told this terrible news regarding Mrs Graham. Rose, however, promised she did not and would not believe it, and my mother said the same. I fear, though, that my mother had doubts about Mrs Graham. She continued to make comments about the news.</p>

	<p>"Dear, dear! I always thought there was something strange about Mrs Graham!" she often said to herself during the following days.</p>

	<p>"This news is false and evil. You must not believe such things. The women in this village know little about poor Mrs Graham, and choose to tell their own stories about her," I responded.</p>

	<p>Nearly a week after the upsetting dinner party, I went to visit Mrs Graham one evening. As I arrived, she gave me a sweet smile.</p>

	<p>"Well, Mr Markham, what is it?"</p>

	<p>We walked through the garden together, talking of the new flowers she had recently planted in her garden.</p>

	<p>"Now, Mr Markham," she said calmly, "I like your visits, but I am only a friend to you, nothing more. If you expect that we will have a love affair, you are wrong, and you should leave immediately."</p>

	<p>"I will, then, be your friend, or brother, or anything you wish, but you must let me continue to see you. But, please tell me why we cannot be more than just friends."</p>

	<p>There was a pause.</p>

	<p>"Is it the result of a careless promise?"</p>

	<p>"Perhaps so," she answered&#151;"some day I may tell you, but at present, you should leave, and never again, Gilbert, ask me that question."</p>

	<p>"I will not," I replied.</p>

	<p>We smiled at each other as I left. I went down the hill, and soon saw Mr Lawrence on his horse, coming to Wildfell Hall. As he came near, I stopped his horse.</p>

	<p>"Now Lawrence, tell me where you are going!" I exclaimed.</p>

	<p>"Remove your hand from my horse."</p>

	<p>"Answer my question first!"</p>

	<p>"Really, Mr Markham, you must let me pass. I am going to see my renter, Mrs Graham, on business matters. Now, you should let me pass, the minister is coming now."</p>

	<p>"What, are you quarrelling, Markham&#151;about Mrs Graham, I am sure!" cried the minister.</p>

	<p>"Mr Millward!" I exclaimed, astonished to hear such words. I was too angry to speak. I turned away and went home.</p>
