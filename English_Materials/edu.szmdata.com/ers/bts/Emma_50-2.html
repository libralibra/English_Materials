	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER FIFTY</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">E</span>mma was in perfect happiness when she walked into the house, and she had been in misery when she had walked out for the walk with Mr Knightley. They sat down to tea with Mr Woodhouse, as they usually did. Poor Mr Woodhouse did not suspect what had happened. Her father would be brokenhearted to hear the news. She had always promised him she would never marry, never leave him. And Harriet, poor Harriet. She felt guilty, and could not sleep that night. She decided that while her father lived, she could not marry, it must only be an engagement. What to do about Harriet was much more difficult. How could she spare Harriet from more pain? She decided she would avoid meeting Harriet for some time.</p>

	<p>The next morning, she woke up early, and wrote her letter to Harriet. Soon after breakfast, a letter arrived from Mrs Weston. Emma knew it contained a letter from Frank Churchill. After reading the letter, Emma felt only pity and understanding for him. Before he left Weymouth, he had begged Miss Fairfax to agree to a secret engagement. He was desperately in love, and could not live without her. Soon after, he arrived in Highbury, knowing she was there, as well. He apologized to his father and Mrs Weston for not coming earlier. He then mentioned Miss Woodhouse (this was Emma's favourite part). He realized that his behaviour was unforgivable, but he felt that he must show interest in another woman to keep the engagement a secret. He pursued Emma because he knew she was not in love with him. At the end of his first visit to Highbury, he went to see Emma, and almost told her the secret. He did not speak because he believed she already knew. Then, he spoke of the pianoforte. Miss Fairfax truly did not know who sent it. He now felt terrible shame for his behaviour, and was angry with himself for hurting his dear Miss Fairfax. His behaviour towards Emma very much upset Miss Fairfax. He had demanded that their engagement remain a secret, so she did not speak to him often, and was quite cold to him. He then spoke of the morning at Mr Knightley's home. He arrived late, but before arriving, he met Miss Fairfax walking, and wanted to join her, but she refused. He was upset, but she knew that no one could see them together alone or their secret would be no more. The next day at Box Hill, he doubted her love. He ignored her, and showed another woman attention. A few days after, the day of his aunt's death, he received a letter from her, announcing that she would soon leave Highbury to work for the Smallridge family, as the persistent, impolite Mrs Elton suggested. In the letter, Miss Fairfax broke off the engagement, and said she regretted agreeing to the engagement because it only brought her misery. He replied immediately to her letter, but his letter was lost. She never received it. Two days later, he received a package from her&#151;his own letters all returned. She was extremely surprised that he did not reply to her letter ending their engagement. He then spoke to his uncle, and he promptly agreed to the marriage. He immediately left for Highbury. He saw how ill she was, and felt terribly guilty. He persuaded her to forgive him and continue the engagement, but not in secret. They are again engaged, dearer than ever.</p>
