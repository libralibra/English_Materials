	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER FIVE</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">F</span>or two days I had to work out at the soldier camps in the mountains. When I finally returned to Gorizia, I was eager to see Catherine. However, I had to get a good night's sleep before going to visit her.</p>

	<p>The following evening, I went to the British hospital. I asked the receptionist to call Catherine for me. As I waited in the hall, I looked around the room and noticed it was decorated with sculptures and paintings. I could not help thinking how boring the art was compared with other towns in Italy.</p>

	<p>Eventually, Catherine came to meet me. She looked beautiful. We went out together to the garden, avoiding the eyes of the receptionist who was sitting behind the table.</p>

	<p>"It's been a long time since we've seen each other," Catherine complained.</p>

	<p>"I was up in the mountains for two days," I explained.</p>

	<p>"You could have written me and let me know where you were."</p>

	<p>We soon found ourselves among a group of trees. I stopped walking and pulled her to me. We kissed for a moment and then I asked, "Is there a more private place for us to be together?"</p>

	<p>"I'm afraid not. This is as far as I can go." She looked at me for a moment. "Say, 'I love you, Catherine.'"</p>

	<p>"I love you, Catherine." I had to say it even if I did not mean it.</p>

	<p>"Oh, I love you too, dear Henry. Don't leave me anymore!"</p>

	<p>"I'll never leave you again."</p>

	<p>I did not really love Catherine, but being with her was better than being with the girls in the sex house. I could tell that she was a little crazy, but I felt I could handle it. It was like a game to me.</p>

	<p>We sat down in the grass and I tried to hold her, but she would not let me. I really wanted to have her right then and there, but there were too many people around.</p>

	<p>"Do you feel sleepy?" she asked.</p>

	<p>"Not really."</p>

	<p>Her eyes dropped to the ground.</p>

	<p>"This is stupid. I don't want to play games."</p>

	<p>"Games?"</p>

	<p>"Look, you are a friendly guy, and I like you, but I've already had enough of our lying to each other."</p>

	<p>"Why do you think this way? I love you, Catherine."</p>

	<p>She laughed suddenly. She seemed to be able to read my mind.</p>

	<p>"You can still come to see me. Will you?"</p>

	<p>"Yes, I will."</p>

	<p>"Alright, then. Good night. I need to go back now."</p>

	<p>I wanted to give her a kiss, but she refused. I walked her back to the building, and watched her until she disappeared down the hallway.</p>

	<p>I went back to my room. It was very hot. I could see from the lights flashing up in the mountains that there was a lot of fighting tonight. Rinaldi came in and noticed I was feeling sad.</p>

	<p>"It doesn't seem like things are going well with Miss Barkley now. I'm glad that I decided to stay with Italian women."</p>
