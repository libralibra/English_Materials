	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE</p>

	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">Conclusion</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">T</span>hen, our voyage came to an end. I do not know how we survived that terrible storm, but when I woke up, I was lying in a fisherman's but on the coast of Norway. At that moment, I could not return to France, as communication between the north of Norway and the south was limited.</p>

	<p>Shall this story be believed? I do not know. And it does not matter. I now know that I have crossed 20,000 leagues in that submarine, during which I made many discoveries. But what has happened to the Nautilus? Was it destroyed in the great storm? Does Captain Nemo still live? And does he continue attacking ships, or did he stop after that terrible sight?</p>

	<p>Will we one day find his documents with the history of his life? Shall I ever know the name of this man?</p>

	<p>I hope so. And I also hope that his powerful submarine was not destroyed in that terrible storm, where so many ships have been lost. If Captain Nemo is still alive, I hope his curiosity in the wonders of the sea will kill the anger in his heart.</p>

	<p>Have I not understood it myself? Have I not lived ten months of this unnatural life? The two men who know that secret&#151;Captain Nemo and Myself.</p>
