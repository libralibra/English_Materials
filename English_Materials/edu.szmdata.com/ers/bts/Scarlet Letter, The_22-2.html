	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO</p>

	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">The March</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">B</span>efore Hester Prynne could consider what to do, after hearing this terrible news, the sound of the music for the great march began. The town leaders would soon be walking proudly down the streets, followed by the ministers of the community. After the long march, the minister, Mr Dimmesdale was to give a speech.</p>

	<p>Soon, the march began, and the town leaders were seen. Little Pearl clapped her hands, excited to see the march. After a short time, Mr Dimmesdale walked down the street, along with the other respected town ministers. The townspeople noticed, during this march, that the young minister had never before looked so strong or courageous; nor did his hand rest over his heart. There was his body, but where was his mind? He was concerned with the affair with Hester and little Pearl.</p>

	<p>Hester Prynne looked at the minister with confusion. He seemed so far away from her now. Perhaps she had dreamed of their meeting in the forest. How deeply they had known each other in the dark forest! And was this the man? She hardly knew him now! He moved proudly past, walking next to the other noble ministers. Hester felt a great deal of sadness in thinking that she had, perhaps, dreamed of the meeting in the forest.</p>

	<p>Pearl saw her mother looking upset, and looked up into Hester's face.</p>

	<p>"Mother," said she, "was that the same minister that kissed me at the stream in the forest?"</p>

	<p>"Do not speak of that, dear little Pearl!" whispered her mother. "We must not always talk in the market place of what happens to us in the forest."</p>

	<p>"I am not sure that it was him; so strange he looked," continued the child. "Or, I would have run to him, and told him to kiss me now, before all the people. What would the minister have said. Mother? Would he have put his hand to his heart and looked at me angrily?"</p>

	<p>"What he would say, Pearl," answered Hester, "is that no one should be giving kisses in the market place."</p>

	<p>The two continued to watch the march pass on just as old Mistress Hibbins walked over to Hester with an evil smile on her face.</p>

	<p>"Now, what terrible thoughts are you thinking of, Hester Prynne?" whispered the old lady to Hester. "That man over there, is greatly respected by all the people here. But, this minister, are you sure, Hester, that he is the same man that you saw in the forest?"</p>

	<p>"Madam, I do not know what you are speaking about," answered Hester Prynne, quite astonished.</p>

	<p>"Foolish woman!" cried the old lady. "I have been in the forest many times before. Do you think I go there and not know who else is in the forest, as well? Hester, we see your punishment burning on your chest, which is certain. But, this minister! "Why does he cover his heart, as if to hide something? Ha, Hester Prynne!"</p>

	<p>"What is it, good Mistress Hibbins?" eagerly asked little Pearl. "Have you seen it?"</p>

	<p>"No matter, darling!" responded Mistress Hibbins. "You will see it one day, my dear. You will come with me and we will see it together!" she told little Pearl.</p>

	<p>By this time, the march was nearly over, and the minister Mr Dimmesdale was heard speaking to the people. Hester Prynne listened to his voice carefully, but she could not understand his meaning, as she was only listening to the sound of his voice, and imagining escaping from the town very soon.</p>
