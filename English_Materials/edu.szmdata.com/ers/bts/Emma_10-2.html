	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER TEN</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">O</span>ne December morning, Emma and Harriet took a walk to visit a sick family, who lived nearby. This family's home, on Vicarage Lane, was on the same road as Mr Elton's cottage.</p>

	<p>"There it is. You will go there soon, Harriet," Emma told her friend.</p>

	<p>"How very beautiful!" replied Harriet.</p>

	<p>"I do not often walk this way, but if you were to live here, I would certainly walk down this road often."</p>

	<p>"I do wonder, Miss Woodhouse, why you are not married. You're so charming, you know."</p>

	<p>"Well, Harriet, if I am to marry, I must think my husband is charming, as well. I haven't found any man charming enough, so I don't want to marry."</p>

	<p>"I don't believe you," replied Harriet.</p>

	<p>"If I will ever change my mind, I must find a man better than any men I now know."</p>

	<p>"It is quite strange to hear a woman say that!"</p>

	<p>"Most women marry so their husbands will take care of them, but my father takes care of me. My father believes I cannot do wrong, but a husband may not agree, so why should I marry?"</p>

	<p>"But, what will you do?" asked Harriet.</p>

	<p>"I have my fortune and my activities. If I give up playing music, I'll read more books. If I give up reading books, I'll draw more. Besides, I will always have my sister's children to keep me busy."</p>

	<p>As they came close to the cottage, the two girls walked slower. Soon, they saw Mr Elton standing in front of the house. The three spoke about the sick family, as Mr Elton had been visiting the family, as well. Then, the three walked together. Emma stopped to tie her shoe, so that Harriet and Mr Elton would walk alone together. She then continued on, behind the two. However, they soon stopped to wait for her. As the three came back to Mr Elton's cottage, Emma stopped again. She broke her shoelace to provide an excuse for the two girls to be invited into the cottage.</p>

	<p>"Part of my lace is gone," said she, "Mr Elton, please ask your housekeeper for a string to keep my boot on."</p>

	<p>Mr Elton looked delighted. Emma was taken with the housekeeper to a room, while Harriet and Mr Elton were left alone in the sitting room to talk. When Emma returned to join them, they were standing together near a window. Mr Elton had told Harriet that he saw the two girls walking and followed them. Emma decided that Mr Elton was interested in Harriet, but was rather careful and shy.</p>
