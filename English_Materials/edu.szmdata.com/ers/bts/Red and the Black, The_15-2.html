	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">The Call of the Cock</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">T</span>he next day they sat in the garden again. Immediately Julien put his lips to Mrs de R&#x00EA;nal's ear and said, "Madam, tonight I will come to your room at two o'clock in the morning. I have something to say to you."</p>

	<p>Her reply was short and angry. "How dare you!"</p>

	<p>Julien left to say something to the children, and when he returned he sat away from Mrs de R&#x00EA;nal.</p>

	<p>When two o'clock came, Julien was very nervous, but he decided to go to her room. He listened at Mr de R&#x00EA;nal's room and heard him sleeping. Then he turned and opened Mrs de R&#x00EA;nal's door. A light was on! Mrs de R&#x00EA;nal jumped out of bed and cried, "You horrible person!" Julien fell to his knees and cried. She continued to yell at him.</p>

	<p>Later, when Julien left, he had nothing left to desire. But even as he made love to Mrs de R&#x00EA;nal he was still playing a role. He tried to play an experienced lover, and he always thought of duty. Because of these thoughts, he could not enjoy what happened.</p>

	<p>"Is this all there is to being loved?" He asked himself, "Did I play my part properly?"</p>
