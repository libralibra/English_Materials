One night, they went to dine on the river. While smiling contentedly at one another in the moonlight, Leon saw a silk ribbon lying on the floor of the boat. The boatman examined it.</p>

	<p>"Ah, yes, that belongs to a party I took out the other day. A lively group of ladies and gentlemen they were. One of them in particular, a tall handsome man&#160;... Adolphe&#160;... Dodolphe&#160;... perhaps Rodolphe."</p>

	<p>"What's the matter, dear?" said Leon.</p>

	<p>"Nothing, it's just a bit cold."</p>
