	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER FIVE</p>

	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">Striking a Bargain</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">"H</span>ow do you know Mrs de R&#x00EA;nal? When did you speak to her?" Old Sorel shouted.</p>

	<p>"I've never spoken to her," replied Julien. "I've only seen her at church."</p>

	<p>"There's something happening, still," the old peasant said. "But now I'll be rid of you. You're going to be Mr de R&#x00EA;nal's tutor."</p>

	<p>"I don't want to be a servant. Who will I have my meals with?"</p>

	<p>Sorel didn't want to miss this chance to be rid of Julien, but Julien would not eat with the servants. He'd rather run away and join the army. His goals were very high, and being like a servant would end it.</p>

	<p>When Sorel spoke to Mr de R&#x00EA;nal again, the subject of meals was settled; Julien would eat with Mr and Mrs de R&#x00EA;nal. Sorel had an idea to get more money, though.</p>

	<p>"We've had a better offer."</p>

	<p>Fear of losing his new tutor made the mayor agree to a higher pay for Julien. Having won this small battle, Sorel said, "I'll send my son up to the house," and left.</p>

	<p>On his way to the house, Julien thought again about joining the church. In his youth he admired Napoleon, but after he saw liberals jailed he began thinking about becoming a priest. He had learned the entire Bible in Latin with Father Ch&#x00E9;lan. Julien felt that joining the church would offer him many opportunities. Napoleon became famous building a great army, but in this time the church had more power. Now Julien was afraid to become a soldier.</p>

	<p>Mrs de R&#x00EA;nal was also afraid. She loved her boys dearly, and she wanted no tutor to be mean to them.</p>
