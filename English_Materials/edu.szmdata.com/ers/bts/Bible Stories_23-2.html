	<p class="storyTitle">23. The Passover Feast</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">G</span>od told Moses and Aaron to meet with the leaders of Israel. They were to do what he said so they would be protected when God came through Egypt to kill the firstborn sons.</p>

	<p>Moses told the leaders that the father of each of the Israelite families must find a lamb and kill it. The blood of the lamb must be smeared on the top and sides of the doors of their houses. Then they should roast the lamb's flesh and prepare it for a feast.</p>

	<p>"Eat all of the meat the night of the feast," Moses told them. "When God comes in the night to find the firstborn sons, he will see the blood on your doors. He will know you are one of his people and he will pass over your house to the next.</p>

	<p>He told them that every year they should observe the day of the Passover and remember the night the Lord saved them.</p>

	<p>Shortly after midnight on the night of the Passover, a great cry rose up from the Egyptian people. Just as God had promised, all the firstborn sons had died. Even the firstborn cattle in the herds were dead.</p>

	<p>The Israelites had obeyed God and stayed in their homes, eating the roast lamb. They had worn their shoes and travelling clothes to the table so they would be ready when Moses called to them.</p>

	<p>Pharaoh sent for Moses and Aaron as soon as he discovered what had happened to the firstborn sons. He knew that this time, God had proven he was more powerful than Pharaoh. Now he was very eager to get the Israelites out of his country.</p>

	<p>"Get away from my people," he said. "Take your women and children and animals too. Leave my country and never come back."</p>

	<p>So Moses sent word to the Israelites, and everyone came out of their houses and into the street. After all the disasters and plagues that they had to endure, the Egyptians were happy to see the Israelites go. They gave the Israelites gifts to take with them.</p>

	<p>On that very day, Moses began to lead all the people of Israel out of town, back toward the Promised Land.</p>
