	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER THIRTY-TWO</p>

	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">Phineas Fogg Struggles with Bad Fortune</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">T</span>he China left, and it seemed to carry away Phineas Fogg's last hope. None of the other steamers would suit him.</p>

	<p>Passepartout was crushed. He could not believe they missed the boat by three-quarters of an hour. It was his fault. Instead of helping his master, he had caused him so much trouble. Mr Fogg, however, was not angry. He only said, "We will decide what is best tomorrow. Come."</p>

	<p>They crossed the Hudson River and went to the St. Nicholas Hotel, on Broadway Avenue. Mr Fogg slept well, but Aouda and the others were too anxious to sleep.</p>

	<p>The next day was the 12th of December. From seven in the morning of the 12th to a quarter before nine in the evening of the 21st there were nine days, thirteen hours, and forty-five minutes. If Phineas Fogg had left on the China, he would have reached London in time.</p>

	<p>Mr Fogg left the hotel alone, and went to look for a boat. There were many boats in the great harbor, but Mr Fogg could not find a useful one.</p>

	<p>He seemed about to give up hope, when he saw a trading boat. It was ready to depart. Phineas Fogg immediately went to the boat, which was called the Henrietta. There he met the captain. The captain was about fifty years old, with big eyes, red hair, and a thick neck.</p>

	<p>"The captain?" asked Mr Fogg.</p>

	<p>"I am the captain."</p>

	<p>"I am Phineas Fogg, of London."</p>

	<p>"And I am Andrew Speedy, of Cardiff."</p>

	<p>"Where are you going?"</p>

	<p>"Bordeaux, in France. I never take passengers, though."</p>

	<p>"Will you carry me and three other persons to Liverpool?"</p>

	<p>"To Liverpool? Why not to China?"</p>

	<p>"I said Liverpool."</p>

	<p>"No!"</p>

	<p>"No?"</p>

	<p>"No. I am going to Bordeaux, and I shall go to Bordeaux."</p>

	<p>"I will hire you."</p>

	<p>"No."</p>

	<p>"I will buy the boat."</p>

	<p>"No."</p>

	<p>Phineas Fogg did not show any disappointment. This was not the same situation as at Hong Kong, and this captain was different. Money would not work here.</p>

	<p>Phineas Fogg had an idea.</p>

	<p>"Will you carry me to Bordeaux?"</p>

	<p>"No, not even for two hundred dollars."</p>

	<p>"I offer you two thousand."</p>

	<p>"For each person?"</p>

	<p>"Yes. And there are four of us."</p>

	<p>Captain Speedy scratched his head. He would make eight thousand dollars, without changing his destination. Besides, passengers at two thousand dollars are no longer passengers. They are valuable goods. "I start at nine o'clock," said Captain Speedy. "Are you and your party ready?"</p>

	<p>"We will be on board at nine o'clock," replied Mr Fogg.</p>

	<p>When Passepartout heard how much this was going to cost, all he could say was, "Oh!"</p>

	<p>As for Fix, he knew the Bank of England would not get all of its money back.</p>

	<p>When they reached England, more than seven thousand pounds would have been spent!</p>
