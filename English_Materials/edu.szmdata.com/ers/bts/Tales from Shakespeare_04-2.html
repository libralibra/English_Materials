	<p class="storyTitle">Cymbeline</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">D</span>uring the great old days of Rome, a king named Cymbeline ruled in Britain. Cymbeline's first wife had died when his three children were very young. He had two sons and a daughter. Imogen was his daughter. Sadly, the two young sons were stolen from their room when they were very small. Cymbeline never found out what happened to them, or who took them. So Imogen was the only child in the house.</p>

	<p>After a while Cymbeline married again. His second wife was a very bad woman. She hated her stepdaughter, Imogen.However, the new queen wanted Imogen to marry her son, from her first marriage. (The queen had also been married before.) The queen hoped that when Cymbeline died, her own son, Cloten, would become king of Britain. If the king's sons were not found, then the Princess Imogen would become her father's heir. If Cloten married Imogen, then he would have the power.</p>

	<p>Unfortunately for the evil queen, Imogen married someone else, without telling her father or the queen. She married a man named Posthumous Leonatus. This man was a great scholar and a fine gentleman. Posthumous' parents had both died when he was a young boy. Cymbeline felt sorry for the boy, and raised him like a son. Imogen and Posthumous had the same teachers, and played together often. They loved each other very much, and when they grew up they decided to marry in secret.</p>

	<p>The evil queen was very angry, of course. She had spies who were always watching Imogen. Immediately, the queen told Cymbeline that Imogen had secretly married. When he heard the news, he was also angry. Imogen, who was a princess, was supposed to marry a prince. Cymbeline told Posthumous to leave the kingdom, and never come back. "If you ever return to Britain, you will be killed!" said the king. Imogen was, of course, terribly sad and upset.</p>

	<p>The queen pretended to feel sorry for Imogen. She offered to arrange a secret meeting between Imogen and Posthumous, who was going to Rome the next day. The queen was kind to Imogen for a reason. She hoped that when Posthumous had gone, she could persuade Imogen that her marriage was not real. After all, Cymbeline had not given his permission.</p>

	<p>Imogen and Posthumous were able to meet. Imogen gave her husband a diamond ring, which had been her dead mother's. Posthumous promised always to wear the ring. He gave Imogen a bracelet. He asked her to take good care of it, and wear it always, to remember his love. Then they said goodbye. They promised to love each other forever.</p>

	<p>After her husband left, Imogen spent all her time alone. She was quiet and sad. Meanwhile, Posthumous arrived in Rome. In Rome, he made friends with many young men. These men were always talking about women. Each man thought that the women of his own country were the best. Posthumous, who loved Imogen, said that he thought his wife was the most beautiful, wise, and loyal lady in the world.</p>

	<p>One of these men, named Iachimo, thought that Roman women were the best. He didn't believe that Imogen could remain loyal to her husband. This made Posthumous very angry. Finally, after many arguments, Iachimo had an idea. He would go to Britain, and try to make Imogen fall in love with him. Posthumous agreed to this plan. The men agreed that if Iachimo didn't succeed, he had to give Posthumous a lot of money. However, if Imogen did fall in love with Iachimo, then things would be different. Iachimo would persuade Imogen to give him Posthumous' bracelet. Then, Posthumous would give Iachimo the diamond ring which Imogen had given him. Posthumous wasn't worried. He was sure that Imogen wouldn't fall in love with Iachimo.</p>

	<p>When Iachimo arrived in Britain, Imogen greeted him politely as a friend of her husband's. But when Iachimo began to speak words of love to her, she was angry. Iachimo soon realized that he would never win the bet with Posthumous. But now, he really wanted to win the bet. So Iachimo came up with another idea. One night, he hid inside a large trunk in Imogen's bedroom until she came in and went to sleep. When she was asleep, Iachimo got out of the trunk and looked at the room very carefully. He wrote down everything that was in the room. Then he very carefully took the bracelet off Imogen's arm, and left the room.</p>

	<p>The next day, Iachimo returned to Rome. When he arrived, he went to find Posthumous. "Look, Imogen loves me now. She gave me your bracelet. She even let me spend a night in her bedroom!" he said. Then Iachimo described Imogen's bedroom exactly. At first, Posthumous didn't believe a word of the story. But then Iachimo took out the bracelet.</p>

	<p>"Do you remember this jewel?" he asked. "Imogen gave it to me. She said, 'I loved it once, but no more.'"</p>

	<p>When Posthumous heard this, he was terribly sad, angry, and jealous. He said the most terrible things about Imogen. He gave the diamond ring to Iachimo, and ran out of the room. Posthumous then wrote a letter to his friend Pisanio. Pisanio was a servant of Posthumous, and was his good friend. In the letter, Posthumous said that he wanted Pisanio to take Imogen to a town called Milford-Haven, in the country of Wales. This town was by the seaside. When they reached Milford-Haven, Pisanio was supposed to kill Imogen. At the same time, Posthumous also wrote a letter to Imogen. In this letter, Posthumous said that he wanted her to go with Pisanio. "I cannot live without you any more, dear wife. I will come to Milford-Haven to meet you," he wrote.</p>

	<p>Imogen didn't know what had happened. She was extremely happy to receive her husband's letter. She loved Posthumous more than anyone in the world. She and Pisanio left for Wales immediately.</p>

	<p>Pisanio and Imogen had almost arrived at Milford-Haven, when Pisanio told the lady the truth. He did not want to kill Imogen, even though he was a friend of her husband's. Imogen was terribly upset, but Pisanio told her not to worry. "When he sees you, Posthumous will realize he made a mistake," said Pisanio. Pisanio told Imogen that she should dress herself in men's clothes, for safety. Imogen agreed. She decided to go to Rome and find her husband, disguised as a servant Although Posthumous had treated Imogen terribly, she still loved him.</p>

	<p>Pisanio then had to leave Imogen, and return to Britain. Before he left, he gave her a small bottle. "The queen wanted you to have this medicine, in case you become sick," he said.</p>

	<p>Now, the queen hated Pisanio because he was these lovers' good friend. She gave Pisanio the bottle because she had thought it contained poison. Earlier, the queen had ordered her doctor to give her some poison. But the doctor knew the evil queen very well. He didn't trust her, so he gave her a sleeping drug instead. This drug made a person sleep so deeply, that they would seem to be dead. But then they would awake after a few hours. The queen wanted to kill Imogen, so she told Pisanio that the bottle held medicine.</p>

	<p>After Pisanio left, Imogen walked for a long time. She wanted to find Milford-Haven, and get on a boat to Rome. But instead, she found a cave where two young, handsome men lived. What Imogen did not know was that these men were really her missing brothers!</p>

	<p>These young men lived with a man named Belarius. It was Belarius who had stolen the boys when they were young. He had been a lord in Cymbeline's castle. A long time ago, Belarius had been falsely accused of treason to Cymbeline, Cymbeline told Belarius to leave Britain and never come back. To get revenge, Belarius had stolen the king's two sons. He took them far away, where they lived in a cave in the forest. Although Belarius had taken the children in anger, he soon loved them as if they were his own sons. He taught them to read, write, and hunt in the forest. These two boys grew up, and were happy, brave, and strong. They did not know they were princes, the sons of king Cymbeline. They believed that Belarius was their father.</p>

	<p>Imogen had been trying to find Milford-Haven, where she could take a boat to Rome. But instead, she became lost in a great forest. When she found the boys' cave, she was weak and tired. Even if a young princess wears men's clothes, she is still a young lady. Imogen was not used to so much exercise.</p>

	<p>Imogen entered the cave, hoping to find someone inside. The cave was empty, but Imogen saw some cooked meat sitting on a stone. She was so hungry that she sat down and began to eat it. "Oh, how tired I am. It seems that a man's life is a hard one! For two nights, I have slept on the cold, hard ground. I thought the town by the ocean was nearby!" Then Imogen thought about her husband. "Oh, Posthumous, how could you treat me this way?" she said aloud.</p>

	<p>By this time Imogen's two brothers and Belarius had returned home. Belarius had named the boys Polydore and Cadwal. But these were not their real names; their real names were Guiderius and Arviragus.</p>

	<p>Belarius entered the cave first. He was surprised to see Imogen there. She wore men's clothes, so he thought she was a man. "Don't come in yet, my sons!" he said. "There is a strange man here, who is eating our food!</p>

	<p>Imogen came forward and spoke to them. "Good men, please do not hurt me. I am lost in the forest, and was terribly hungry. I can pay you for this meat."</p>

	<p>But the men would not take her money. "Where are you going, and who are you?" asked Belarius.</p>

	<p>"My name is Fidele," said Imogen. "I am trying to find the town of Milford-Haven. I want to take a boat to Rome, but I am lost."</p>

	<p>"Listen, my good young man," said Belarius. "Do not think we are wild or stupid men, because we live in a cave. Please stay with us tonight, and eat and sleep here. You will feel better when you leave."</p>

	<p>Imogen's brothers welcomed her kindly. They wanted to roast a deer they had just killed. Imogen was very helpful in preparing this meal. Perhaps it was because these people were related, they all liked each other very much. The brothers wanted Imogen to stay with them. She happily agreed to stay for a while, before continuing her journey.</p>

	<p>The venison they had just taken was all eaten and they were going out to hunt for more. However, Imogen could not go with them. She felt very tired and ill. When she was alone, she lay down and drank the liquid in the bottle. This was the sleeping drug, but Imogen thought it was medicine, of course. Soon Imogen fell into a deep sleep. It seemed that she was dead.</p>

	<p>When the men returned from their hunting, they were shocked to find that "Fidele" was dead. They were terribly sad. Belarius suggested that they bury their friend in the forest. Imogen's two brothers carried her outside and laid her in the grass. Then they sang funeral songs over her body. They covered her body with leaves and flowers. Then they left, very sad.</p>

	<p>Of course, Imogen was not dead. It wasn't long after this that she awoke. She found herself in the forest. "Was I dreaming? I thought I had met some kind young men and their father." Imogen didn't see anyone around her. She decided everything had been a dream. Once again Imogen began to walk, trying to find the town of Milford-Haven.</p>

	<p>But great and terrible things were happening at this time. Imogen didn't know anything about them. A war had begun between the Roman emperor, Augustus Caesar, and king Cymbeline. The Roman army had entered Britain. In fact, the Roman army and Imogen were in the same forest. And with the Roman army was Posthumous.</p>

	<p>Although Posthumous was now with the Roman army, he wanted to fight them. He wanted to join King Cymbeline's army, because he was still loyal to Britain.</p>

	<p>At this time, Posthumous believed Imogen was dead. Pisanio had lied, and written a letter saying that he had killed Imogen. Posthumous felt terrible that Imogen was dead, even though he had ordered her death. All Posthumous wanted to do now was die in battle.</p>

	<p>Before Imogen could reach the town of Milford-Haven, she was captured by the Romans. The Roman soldiers decided to make Imogen a servant of Lucius, a great Roman general.</p>

	<p>Cymbeline's army entered the forest, to fight the Romans. Imogen's lost brothers, Polydore and Cadwal, decided to join the British army. The two young men wanted to fight bravely. They didn't know they were fighting with their own father, the king. Belarius decided to go with the brothers and fight as well. He also wanted to defeat the Romans.</p>

	<p>Then there was a terrible battle. The British army might have lost, and Cymbeline been killed. But fortunately, Posthumous, Belarius, and the two young brothers rescued the king. The British were eventually able to defeat the Romans.</p>

	<p>After the battle was over, many people wanted to talk to king Cymbeline. Posthumous, who still hoped to die, remembered that the punishment for his return to Britain was death. He hoped Cymbeline would kill him.</p>

	<p>Meanwhile, Imogen and her master, the Roman general Lucius, were taken prisoners. They were taken to see king Cymbeline. Iachimo, Imogen and Posthumous' enemy, was also a prisoner. When these three prisoners were before the king, Posthumous came in. At the same time, Belarius, Polydore, and Cadwal also came to see the king.</p>

	<p>So it was a very strange situation. Although Cymbeline did not know it, his daughter and sons were standing there, in front of him!</p>

	<p>Imogen stared at Posthumous, who was disguised as a poor man. She recognized him, but he did not know her. Imogen also recognized Iachimo. He wore the diamond ring she had given Posthumous on his finger! "Why does Iachimo have my ring?" she thought. Imogen did not yet know that Iachimo had caused all the trouble.</p>

	<p>The only person who recognized Imogen was an old servant Pisanio. He watched her from a corner of the room. "It is my lady Imogen!" he thought. "Who knows what will happen now, good or bad." Belarius knew who she was, too. Or, he thought he did.</p>

	<p>"Look, Cadwal. Is that our friend, Fidele?" Belarius said.</p>

	<p>"Yes, that young boy looks just like Fidele," said Cadwal.</p>

	<p>"No, it's impossible. If that were Fidele, then he would have spoken to us," said Belarius.</p>

	<p>Meanwhile, the Roman general, Lucius, spoke to the king. "I am a Roman, and will die bravely. But I want to ask you to do one thing." He pointed to Imogen. "This young man is from Britain. Do not kill him. I have never had a servant who was so kind and excellent. Allow him to live. He has not harmed Britain, although he served a Roman."</p>

	<p>Cymbeline looked closely at his daughter Imogen. He did not know who he was, but he felt that he was special. "All right," he said. "I will let this young man live. He is very familiar to me. I don't know why. Boy, you may live. You may ask me for whatever you want or need, and I will give it to you."</p>

	<p>Everyone was very interested to hear what Lucius' servant would ask for. Lucius the Roman said, "I will not beg for my life, my good boy. I know you will ask the king to save me, too."</p>

	<p>"No, no," said Imogen sadly. "I cannot. I have something else to do, master. I cannot ask the king for your life." This amazed the Roman general.</p>

	<p>Imogen then said, "King Cymbeline, I ask for this. Make that man, Iachimo, tell me where he got that ring on his finger!"</p>

	<p>Cymbeline agreed. "Iachimo, tell this young boy what he wants to hear. Otherwise, you will be tortured."</p>

	<p>Iachimo then told everyone the whole truth. He told everyone about his bet with Posthumous, and how he had tricked both Posthumous and Imogen.</p>

	<p>What Posthumous felt at hearing this story cannot be described. He instantly stepped forward, and told Cymbeline that he had made Pisanio kill Imogen, because he thought she loved Iachimo. Now, he discovered that Imogen was innocent. "Oh, Imogen!" he shouted. "My life, my queen!" Now he wanted to die more than ever.</p>

	<p>Imogen hated to see Posthumous in this condition. She immediately took off her disguise. Posthumous was overjoyed to see his wife alive. Cymbeline, who was just as happy as Posthumous, forgave the two lovers for marrying against his desires. He was happy to have Posthumous as a son-in-law.</p>

	<p>Belarius chose this time to tell his old enemy Cymbeline the truth about his lost sons. He showed Polydore and Cadwal to the king. "Here are your two lost sons, whose names were Guiderius and Arviragus."</p>

	<p>Cymbeline was so happy and amazed to see his sons, that he forgave his old friend. For, how could he be angry, when his two sons and his daughter were all together again?</p>

	<p>Now Imogen asked her father to allow Lucius the Roman to live. Cymbeline agreed to do so. Lucius and Cymbeline created a treaty, so that the kingdoms of Rome and Britain were peaceful for many years.</p>

	<p>As for Cymbeline's wicked wife, the Queen, she soon grew sick and died. But that story should not appear here. It is enough to say that everyone who was truly good became happy.</p>
