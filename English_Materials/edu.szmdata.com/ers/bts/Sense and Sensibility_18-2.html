	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER EIGHTEEN</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">E</span>linor saw with great uneasiness the nervousness of poor Edward. She was delighted to see him, indeed, but was quite worried, seeing that he was so unhappy.</p>

	<p>The next morning, he joined Elinor and Marianne at the breakfast table before the others came down. Marianne immediately left the room, as she wished to give the two time to speak alone. Just a moment after, Edward stood up to leave, announcing that he was going into the village to see his horse.</p>

	<p>Edward soon returned, commenting on the delightful beauty of the area. Marianne soon joined him in speaking of the natural charm of the hills and valleys nearby. Soon enough, Edward interrupted her:</p>

	<p>"Marianne&#151;remember, I have dull opinions in comparison to your sensibilities and taste," he said, looking a bit angry. "You must be satisfied with my honest opinions of nature's beauty."</p>

	<p>"I believe," said Elinor, "Edward believes that many people pretend to feel more strongly about the beauties of nature than they truly feel. He becomes bored with such false emotions."</p>

	<p>Marianne looked with surprise at Edward, and the subject was continued no further; Marianne remained silent till a new topic interested her.</p>

	<p>Soon after, when they were having tea, Marianne noticed a ring of hair around his finger, a present a lover would often give, or a close relation.</p>

	<p>"I never saw you wear a ring before, Edward," she cried. "Is that Fanny's hair? I remember her promising to give you some, but I thought her hair was darker."</p>

	<p>Edward looked quite embarrassed, and looked at Elinor quickly before replying. "Yes, it is my sister's hair. It must look lighter on my finger than it usually does."</p>

	<p>Elinor believed the hair to be her own, and felt satisfied, although she did not know how he had taken a piece of her hair, as she had never given a lock of her hair to him.</p>
