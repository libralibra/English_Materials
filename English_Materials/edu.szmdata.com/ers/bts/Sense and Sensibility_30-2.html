	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER THIRTY</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">M</span>rs Jennings came immediately to their room after her return.</p>

	<p>"How are you, my dear?" she said, in a voice of great tenderness.</p>

	<p>"How is she, Miss Dashwood? Poor thing! She looks very bad. Ah, so it is true. He is to be married very soon, that cheat! I have no respect for him. I just heard from a friend of Miss Grey's. If ever I meet him again, I will not treat him with any kindness. He is no longer considered a friend of mine!"</p>

	<p>She then went away, leaving the two girls alone again.</p>

	<p>Later in the evening, Elinor was sitting with Mrs Jennings, while Marianne was resting in her room.</p>

	<p>"This lady, Miss Grey, is she very rich?"</p>

	<p>"Fifty thousand pounds, my dear. Have you ever seen her? She is a stylish girl, but not beautiful. I have heard young Willoughby has spent almost all his fortune, so he will certainly need her large income."</p>

	<p>"I do hope," said Elinor carefully, "you will advise the Palmers and Sir John not to mention Mr Willoughby's name in Marianne's presence. It would be quite cruel to do so."</p>

	<p>"Oh, of course! You must not worry, they will never mention his name before her!"</p>

	<p>The next afternoon, Colonel Brandon came for a visit, although Marianne was resting in her room, not interested in meeting anyone other than her sister.</p>

	<p>He had heard of Mr Willoughby's engagement to Miss Grey, and came to find out how Marianne was handling the heart-breaking news. Although he was, most likely, overjoyed that Marianne would not soon be married, he did look like he suffered greatly, knowing that his dear Marianne was so greatly upset.</p>
