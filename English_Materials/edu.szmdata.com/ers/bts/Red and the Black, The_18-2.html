	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER EIGHTEEN</p>

	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">A King in Verri&#x00E8;res</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">O</span>n September third an officer rode into town. He woke the whole town to tell them the king would come the next Sunday. The officer said the town needed an honor guard to meet the king. A message was sent to the countryside, and Mr de R&#x00EA;nal came into town. He needed to choose a leader for the honor guard. There was much work to be done.</p>

	<p>Mrs de R&#x00EA;nal was very busy. She decided she wanted to see Julien in different clothes&#151;he always wore his black suit. She talked to the district leader Mr de Maugiron and got Julien a place in the honor guard. Mr Valenod also gave Julien a great horse to use. Mr Valenod hated Julien, but he liked Mrs de R&#x00EA;nal very much.</p>

	<p>The king would also visit a nearby church, so many priests needed to be there. Father Maslon, the new town priest, did not want Father Ch&#x00E9;lan to be there. Father Ch&#x00E9;lan was a Jansenist, but most powerful members of the church were Jesuits. Mr de R&#x00EA;nal knew Father Ch&#xE9;lan must be there, though. The king was bringing Marquis de la Mole, and the marquis knew Father Ch&#x00E9;lan very well. Finally, Father Maslon agreed. Father Ch&#x00E9;lan asked Julien to be his assistant for that night.</p>

	<p>On Sunday the honor guard rode through town to meet the king. Many people in town were very angry. This peasant was in the honor guard and many rich men were not! Julien was the happiest of men, though. He felt like he was one of Napoleon's soldiers. Only one person was happier. She watched him in his new sky-blue clothes and thought he was most handsome.</p>

	<p>After the king arrived, Julien quickly went home. Sadly, he changed into his religious clothes and went to the church. Father Ch&#x00E9;lan and Julien then left to find the young Bishop of Agde, who was Marquis de la Mole's nephew. Julien walked through the beautiful church and finally found a young man. This is the bishop? This man is only seven or eight years older than me! Julien thought.</p>

	<p>That night the church was beautiful and the church service was very good. Even the king bowed when the bishop spoke. Julien did not think about Napoleon or army glory any more. The bishop was young, but very rich and powerful. Julien realized that the church was the place to find real power.</p>
