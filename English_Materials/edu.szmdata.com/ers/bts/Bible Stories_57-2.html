	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">E</span>very day a huge crowd gathered at the temple to hear Jesus tell stories and talk about God's kingdom. Jesus knew the Jewish leaders listened to him, so he decided to tell a parable. It told what was going to happen to the leaders who wanted to destroy him.</p>

	<p>"A farmer grew grapes on a big piece of land called a vineyard," Jesus said. "He rented the vineyard to some men to take care of because he had to leave the country for many days."</p>

	<p>"At harvest time, the fanners sent a servant to the vineyard. He ordered the servants to collect fruit the men were paying him in rent. But the men were very greedy. They didn't want to pay the farmer, so they killed the servant."</p>

	<p>"Then the farmer decided to send his son. Surely, the men would not harm him J But when the son arrived at the vineyard, they killed him, too."</p>

	<p>"What will the farmer do to these evil men?" Jesus asked. "He will have them killed and give the land to another group of farmers who are not so greedy and evil."</p>
