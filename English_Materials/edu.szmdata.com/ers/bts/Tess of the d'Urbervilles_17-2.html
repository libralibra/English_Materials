	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER SEVENTEEN</p>

	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">Angel Comes Too Late</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">M</span>r and Mrs Clare were waiting for Angel to return. When they heard footsteps, they both ran to greet him in the dark.</p>

	<p>"You are finally home," cried his mother. Nothing at that moment was more important to Mrs Clare than Angel's happiness. When they entered the house, both parents were surprised at how their son had changed. The cruel weather and work had made Angel look 20 years older.</p>

	<p>"I fell ill in Brazil," said Angel. He saw that his parents were worried. "Have any letters come for me? If I had received the other one sooner, I would have come home immediately."</p>

	<p>The minister gave his son Tess' second letter. It was short and angry. Angel threw the paper and cried, "Maybe she will not want me now."</p>

	<p>"She's just a country girl," said his mother.</p>

	<p>"Actually, she is part of one of England's oldest noble families. She is a d'Urberville. I left her because I was small minded. I found out she was not pure. She had been overpowered by a 'gentleman', and it wasn't her fault. I know she is honest and faithful. I must go to her."</p>

	<p>Angel knew Tess was angry, and he knew she was right. He wanted her to have time to think about their marriage. He did not go to her. He wrote her a letter and sent it to Marlott. He was surprised when he received a reply from her mother. It said:</p>

	<p>Dear Sir,</p>

	<p>My daughter has left. I don't know when she'll be back. I cannot tell you where she lives now. We don't live in Marlott.</p>

	<p>Yours,</p>

	<p>Joan Durbeyfield</p>

	<p>At first, Angel wanted to wait for more information from Tess' mother. Then he read again Tess' first letter asking him to come home. He was so touched that he wanted to find Tess even if her family was mad at him.</p>

	<p>While he was packing, the letter Izz and Marian had written arrived. This made him pack faster.</p>

	<p>He looked for Tess at the farm. He found out she had never used her married name. He also discovered how hard her life had been because she would not ask his family for money. When he arrived in Marlott, he found other people living in the Durbeyfield house. As he walked by the church, he saw the place where John Durbeyfield was buried.</p>

	<p>A gravedigger saw Angel looking at the grave.</p>

	<p>"That man wanted to be buried with his ancestors in Kingsbere," said the gravedigger.</p>

	<p>"Why is he here then?"</p>

	<p>"No money. This grave has not yet been paid for."</p>

	<p>Clare went to pay the bill and went to Shaston. There he found Mrs Durbeyfield and her kids. They lived in a small house. Joan seemed embarrassed to see Angel.</p>

	<p>"I'm Tess' husband. I want to see her. Is she well? Where is she?"</p>

	<p>Mrs Durbeyfield would not speak.</p>

	<p>"Do you think Tess wants me to find her?"</p>

	<p>"No," said Joan.</p>

	<p>As he walked away, he remembered how Tess said she would die for him. He turned to Mrs Durbeyfield and said, "I know she wants me. I know her better than you. Please tell me where she is. I am so unhappy without her."</p>

	<p>"She is at Sandbourne."</p>

	<p>"Thank you. Can I help you?"</p>

	<p>"No. We are taken care of."</p>

	<p>When Clare arrived in Sandbourne, he walked the streets looking for Tess. It was a bright, wealthy holiday town with gardens and tourist spots. He felt confused. Why had Tess come here? No one had heard of anyone named Clare or Durbeyfield. Finally, someone said, "There is a d'Urberville living at Mrs Brooks' house."</p>

	<p>Clare went to Mrs Brooks' house. It was large and beautiful. He thought Tess was a servant here. He rang the bell. When Mrs Brooks answered the door, he said, "Is Tess d'Urberville here?"</p>

	<p>"Mrs d'Urberville?"</p>

	<p>Clare was happy that Tess told people she was married. "Yes," he said. "Tell her Angel is here for her. She will know who I am."</p>

	<p>While he waited, Angel wondered what Tess would think of him. He was still weak and he looked old. He was not prepared to see Tess. She was wearing expensive clothes and looked more beautiful than before. Tess stayed in the doorway.</p>

	<p>"Tess," whispered Angel. "Can you forgive me? I didn't see you as you truly were. I'm sorry. Please come to me."</p>

	<p>"It is too late," said Tess. "Stay away, Angel."</p>

	<p>"Do you not love me because I look changed? You are my wife. I've told my parents everything and they will welcome you."</p>

	<p>"Yes, but it's too late. Don't you know what happened? I waited and waited, but you didn't come. I wrote to you and you didn't come. He said you would never come back and he was kind to my family when my father died."</p>

	<p>"I don't understand."</p>

	<p>"He has won me back."</p>

	<p>Clare looked at Tess and understood what had happened. Tess continued to speak.</p>

	<p>"He is upstairs. He lied and said you wouldn't come back, but you did. I hate him now for lying. Angel, please go now and never come back."</p>

	<p>They looked at each other without hope.</p>

	<p>"It's my fault," cried Clare. The woman he had loved would always love him, but she would never be with him again. He had rejected her body and now she belonged to someone else. While he thought, Tess left the room. Clare felt cold and ill. He did not know how, but he managed to go back outside and walk down the street. He did not know where he was going.</p>

	<p>Mrs Brooks did not usually care about her guests. She only cared about the money they gave her. But Angel Clare's visit made her wonder about her wealthy guests Mr and Mrs d'Urberville. When Tess went back upstairs, Mrs Brooks followed her. She listened outside the bedroom door. She heard Tess sobbing. She opened the door a little bit and could see Tess lying on the table.</p>

	<p>"My dear husband came home to me," sobbed Tess. "But it was too late. And you seduced me with your words. You said he would never return. But he did! You helped my family and I believed you. I came to live with you. Now I've lost him again. This time it is forever."</p>

	<p>Mrs Brooks could see Tess' tears. "He looks like he's dying," Tess cried. "It will be my fault if he does. You have destroyed my life and his. I can't bear this." Tess spoke, and then there was silence.</p>

	<p>Mrs Brooks went downstairs. She could hear Tess moving around and saw her leave the house. She was wearing her best clothes. Mr d'Urberville was probably still asleep. He did not like to get up early. She wondered where Mrs d'Urberville was going.</p>

	<p>Then Mrs Brooks saw a red mark on the ceiling. It began to spread. When she stood on a table, it looked like blood. She went upstairs and everything was quiet. Then she heard the noise of water drops. Mrs Brooks ran to the street and found a man to help her. They opened the bedroom door and found a large knife in Alec d'Urberville's heart. He was on the bed, dead and cold. He was still bleeding. Soon the news spread everywhere that Mrs Brooks' guest had been stabbed by his young wife.</p>
