	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER FIFTEEN</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">A</span>fter they finished the operation, I woke up with a very sick feeling. I looked around the room and found Miss Gage standing nearby. "How do you feel?"</p>

	<p>"I'm feeling ill!"</p>

	<p>"It's normal. You'll feel better tomorrow. Your operation was very successful!"</p>

	<p>"Thanks! Did I talk in my sleep?"</p>

	<p>"No. You were very quiet!"</p>

	<p>I felt very weak and soon fell asleep again.</p>

	<p>There were four patients in the hospital now, including myself. Catherine became very well liked among the nurses, because of her willingness to work nights. Miss Ferguson had recently transferred to Milan, as well. I saw her often and I thought she was nice. She would often help Catherine and I send messages to each other.</p>

	<p>"Will you be there when Catherine and I get married?" I asked her one day.</p>

	<p>"I don't believe that will ever happen," she answered.</p>

	<p>"Why not?"</p>

	<p>"Because you'll either have a bad fight with her, or you'll get killed in the war. I don't want her ending up with a baby and no husband. You take care of yourself out there and don't get killed!"</p>

	<p>"I am always careful. You are a good woman, Ferguson."</p>

	<p>"Shut up! Tell me if your head hurts."</p>

	<p>"No, I don't feel anything."</p>

	<p>"Catherine needs to stop working nights for a while. It's taking away too much of her energy."</p>

	<p>"Alright, I'll arrange it, so she works days for a while."</p>

	<p>"Ha! You are too selfish to do such a thing. You like it that she works nights."</p>

	<p>"Of course I like it. However, if it's making her tired, she should rest for a while."</p>

	<p>After Ferguson left, I called for Miss Gage.</p>

	<p>"Would it be possible to put Miss Barkley on the day shift for a while? She seems so tired lately."</p>

	<p>"You know, you can speak more directly to me about this. I'm your friend and I know the truth."</p>

	<p>"Have a drink with me," I said, pulling out the bottle of wine. I poured her a glass and handed it to her.</p>

	<p>"Thank you," she said, "Later on, I'll bring some cool water to put on your legs. They must really itch from the heat. I'm your friend, you know."</p>

	<p>"Of course you are."</p>

	<p>"I don't think you realize how good a friend I am. But one day you will."</p>

	<p>For three days in a row, Catherine was taken off of the late shift. When we finally saw each other again, it seemed like we had been away from each other for months.</p>
