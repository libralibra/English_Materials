	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">E</span>linor was, at first, quite angry with Edward, as she felt he had cheated her. He should not have remained at Norland after his feelings for her had turned to love. But after considering the situation further, Elinor realized that she pitied Edward more than all else. When she remembered that Edward had become engaged to Lucy at nineteen, she realized he was too young and foolish to understand the girl's true nature. After some time, he surely realized what a senseless girl she really is.</p>

	<p>As she considered these thoughts with a great deal of pain, she cried more for him than for herself. She knew that Edward truly loved her, but had already promised to marry Lucy, a selfish shrewd girl he was no longer in love with.</p>
