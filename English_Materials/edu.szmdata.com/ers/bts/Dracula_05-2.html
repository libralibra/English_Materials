	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">Letter to Mina Murray from Lucy Westenra</p>

	<blockquote class="letter">

	<p class="r">24 May</p>

	<p>Dear Mina,</p>

	<p>I was so happy to get your letter! I have wonderful news. Three men asked me to marry them today! Can you believe it? The first one was Dr John Seward. He's the man I wrote to you about in my last letter. He was very nervous and sweet when he asked. I felt sorry for him. In the end, I told him that I could not marry him for my heart belonged to another man. He accepted this and promised to be a good friend to me.</p>

	<p>The second man was an American. His name is Quincey P. Morris. He, too, is very handsome and sweet. I liked the way he talked. He made me laugh. However, I told him the same thing I told Dr Seward: I was in love with someone else. He had only one request, that I kiss him before he left. I did as he asked and, like Dr Seward, he promised to be a good friend.</p>

	<p>The third&#160;... well, I won't write about him just now. I'll just say that I feel like the luckiest and happiest girl alive! I'll see you soon in the town of Whitby.</p>

	<p class="r">Love, Lucy</p>

	<p class="r">May 26th</p>

	<p>Dear Lucy,</p>

	<p>What wonderful news! I can't wait to hear more about it! Jonathan sent me a letter this week. I miss him terribly. His being so far away makes me nervous. Anything could happen to him! Oh, I'll stop complaining. I'm sure he is being careful. See you soon!</p>

	<p class="r">Love, Mina</p>

	<p class="zeroIndentBoldFace">Dr Seward's Diary</p>

	<p>25 May&#151;Trying to forget yesterday's refusal. Putting all of my energies into my research. Today, I focused on my most interesting patient here at the hospital, R. M. Renfield. I fear that he would do quite a bit of harm to people if he were a free man. His ideas are all quite dark and angry. He keeps repeating the same words over and over to himself, but I don't quite understand them. I must watch him more closely.</p>

	<blockquote class="letter">

	<p>Dear friend,</p>

	<p>I hope that you will join John Seward and I for some drinks at my home tomorrow. We want to celebrate your good fortune at winning the hand of that most lovely Lucy Westenra. You're a lucky man. Let us congratulate you with drinks!</p>

	<p class="r">Your friend, Q. P. M.</p>
