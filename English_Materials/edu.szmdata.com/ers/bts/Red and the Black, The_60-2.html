	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER THIRTY</p>

	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">A Man of Intelligence</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">T</span>he marquis could not reach a decision for more than a month. Finally, he gave a short letter to Mathilde. The letter gave Julien and Mathilde some houses near Languedoc. They were worth a lot of money.</p>

	<p>This surprised Julien and made him very happy. Mathilde wanted to have a public wedding, though. One day she was angry, and wrote to her father.</p>

	<blockquote class="letter">

	<p>I have waited six weeks out of respect for you, but soon I will go to Father Pirard to be married. I'm afraid people will use this against you, though. If you come, everything will be fine.</p>

	</blockquote>

	<p>So it's time to make a decision, Marquis de la Mole thought. He sometimes imagined that Julien was killed. Other days he imagined Julien as a noble. The marquis could give him a new name, and invent a story about an illegitimate birth. "He's very clever", the marquis thought, "but there's something I don't trust about him". The marquis wrote a letter to his daughter.</p>

	<blockquote class="letter">

		<p>I am making him an officer in the army. His new name is Mr Julien Sorel de la Vernaye. He must leave tomorrow for Strassburg.</p>

	</blockquote>

	<p>Mathilde was happy, and wrote back.</p>

	<blockquote class="letter">

		<p>Mr de la Vernaye will be very happy, but please don't forget about me. I won't send your letter until you promise we will have a public marriage.</p>

	</blockquote>

	<p>The reply came quickly.</p>

	<blockquote class="letter">

		<p>Fear me, girl! I don't know what kind of person this Julien is, and neither do you. Obey me or I'll do nothing!</p>

	</blockquote>

	<p>That night Julien was full of joy. To be an officer in the army had always been his ambition.</p>
