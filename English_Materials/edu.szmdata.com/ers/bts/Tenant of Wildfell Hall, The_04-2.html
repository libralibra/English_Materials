	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER FOUR</p>

	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">The Party</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">O</span>ur party, on the fifth of November, went quite well, although Mrs Graham refused to join us. My mother, as usual, was cheerful, anxious to keep her guests happy. Mr Millward spoke of religion and gave a short talk about the importance of God. My mother listened carefully, Mr Lawrence was polite, Mary Millward was calm, Richard Wilson was quiet, and Robert Wilson was attentively listening to the speech.</p>

	<p>Mrs Wilson spoke of new and old news in town; the woman talked continually throughout the entire evening, hardly closing her mouth once. Her daughter, Jane, was charming, particularly with the handsome Mr Lawrence. Richard Wilson, Jane's younger brother, sat in a corner, quite a shy child. He was interested in listening to the conversation, but did not wish to speak himself. Rose informed me that poor Richard did not wish to come to the party, but his sister insisted that he do, as Jane wanted Mr Lawrence to know that she had one brother with more gentlemanly manners than Robert. Jane had tried to persuade Robert, her rather uncivilised brother not to attend the party, but he said he might enjoy talking about farming matters with Markham and the old lady (my mother was not really old).</p>

	<p>Mary Millward was silent, as well, during the party. Eliza told me that her father had said she must come, as she was spending too much time on only housework duties and never rested. She sat in the corner next to Richard, the two shared a dislike for talking. My Eliza was charming. Rose was simple and natural, as usual. Fergus, my brother, was impolite and foolish. And finally, Mr Lawrence was a gentleman, particularly to Miss Wilson. I spoke to him throughout the evening, as usual. He is a rather quiet man, with few friends, who has lived alone since the death of his father. I liked the man, but he was a bit too cold and shy. We do not have a deep friendship, but are friends because of family connections.</p>

	<p>Soon after the arrival of the guests, my mother announced that our new neighbour, Mrs Graham, would not join their party, and explained why she had not yet gone to visit the Millwards and the Wilsons.</p>

	<p>"She is a rather shy woman, Mr Lawrence," my mother added, "we don't know what to think about her. Perhaps you can tell us something about her."</p>

	<p>Everyone then turned to Mr Lawrence. He looked confused.</p>

	<p>"I, Mrs Markham!" said he, "you are mistaken&#151;I don't&#151;that is&#151;I have seen her certainly, but I know little about her."</p>

	<p>He then immediately turned to Rose, and asked her to play a song on the piano.</p>

	<p>"No," said she, "you must ask Miss Wilson, she plays better than us all."</p>

	<p>"Now, this is it!" cried Mr Millward, as my mother offered him a glass of liquor. "This drink you make is better than all others, Mrs Markham!"</p>

	<p>"Thank you, but then, Mr Millward, do you think it wrong to take a little wine now and then?" asked my mother.</p>

	<p>"Of course not!" he replied, "we must use what God gives us."</p>

	<p>"But Mrs Graham doesn't agree."</p>

	<p>And my mother explained the story of Mrs Graham's last visit to our home.</p>

	<p>"Wrong?" exclaimed the minister, "that makes the boy a fool!" My mother listened to him carefully as he explained; Mrs Wilson stopped talking for the first time during the evening, and Mr Lawrence sat quietly, smiling to himself.</p>

	<p>"If the child never tastes liquor, he will always be curious, and may one day test it, and perhaps enjoy the taste," Mr Millward continued.</p>

	<p>Mr Lawrence then turned around in his chair to ask if I had met Mrs Graham.</p>

	<p>"I have met her once or twice," I replied.</p>

	<p>"What do you think of her?"</p>

	<p>"I cannot say that I like her much. She is pretty, but certainly not friendly."</p>

	<p>He did not reply.</p>

	<p>As the guests were leaving, I kissed my dear Eliza on the cheek. My mother saw, and was quite upset with my behaviour.</p>

	<p>"My dear Gilbert," said she, "You know how upset I would be if you married Eliza Millward. If you decide to marry her, you will regret it all your life."</p>

	<p>"Well, I'm not going to marry yet, but can't I enjoy myself?"</p>

	<p>"Yes, my dear boy, but not with her. If you give her attention, she will think you plan to marry her. If you do marry her, Gilbert, you'll break my heart."</p>

	<p>"Well, don't cry about it mother," said I, "that was the only kiss I gave Eliza, and I won't do it again, I promise."</p>
