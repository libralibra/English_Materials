	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER FOUR</p>

	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">The Problem</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">W</span>hen Mortimer spoke these words, I knew the case was ours.</p>

	<p>Holmes sat up in his chair, and his eyes showed he was very interested in the mystery.</p>

	<p>"Why did nobody else see this hound's footprints?" he asked.</p>

	<p>"The footprints were about twenty meters from the body. Nobody thought to look so far away," Mortimer replied.</p>

	<p>"Are there many sheep dogs on the moor?" asked Holmes.</p>

	<p>"Yes, there are. But this was no sheep dog. I know what a sheep dog's feet look like. These footprints were very large indeed&#151;enormous," Mortimer answered.</p>

	<p>"But, whatever the animal was, it had not gone near Sir Charles," Holmes said.</p>

	<p>"That's right."</p>

	<p>"What was the weather like on that night?" Holmes asked.</p>

	<p>"It was wet and cold, although it wasn't raining."</p>

	<p>"Describe the path of trees that Sir Charles walked along to me."</p>

	<p>"It is the famous 'Yew Alley' of Baskerville Hall. It is quite peaceful and beautiful. There is a path between two long lines of yew trees. These trees were planted very close together. Down the middle is a path of small stones. The path has grass on each side of it," said the doctor.</p>

	<p>"I understand that in one place there is a gate that leaves the path," said Holmes.</p>

	<p>"Yes, there is a small gate, which leads to the moor."</p>

	<p>"Is there any other opening through the line of trees?"</p>

	<p>"No."</p>

	<p>"So you can enter or leave the Yew Alley only from the Hall, or through the moor gate?" asked Holmes.</p>

	<p>"There is a way out through a summer house at the end of the path."</p>

	<p>"Had Sir Charles reached the summer house?"</p>

	<p>"No. He lay about fifty meters from it," said Mortimer.</p>

	<p>"Now, Dr Mortimer, this is important. You say that the footprints you saw were on the path, and not on the grass?"</p>

	<p>"No footprints could show on the grass," said Mortimer.</p>

	<p>"Were they on the same side of the path as the moor gate?"</p>

	<p>"Yes. They were."</p>

	<p>"I think that is very interesting. Another question: was the gate to the moor closed?"</p>

	<p>"Yes. It was closed and locked."</p>

	<p>"How high is the gate?" asked Holmes.</p>

	<p>"It is very small."</p>

	<p>"So a person could climb over it?"</p>

	<p>"Tell me about the footprints you saw by the moor gate.</p>

	<p>"Sir Charles seems to have stood there for five or ten minutes," said Mortimer. "I know that because the footprints were very deep. Also, his cigar had burned down, and the ash had dropped off the end of it."</p>

	<p>"Excellent!" said Holmes. "This man is a very good detective, Watson."</p>

	<p>"Sir Charles had left his footprints all over that little bit of the path where he was standing. I could not see any other prints."</p>

	<p>Sherlock Holmes smiled.</p>

	<p>"I like to look closely at these things myself," he said. "Dr Mortimer, you should have come to me immediately!"</p>

	<p>"Mr Holmes, the best detective in the world cannot help with some things," the doctor said.</p>

	<p>"You mean, things that do not follow the laws of science&#151;supernatural things?" asked Holmes.</p>

	<p>"I do not know," replied the doctor. "I only know what I have been told. Before Sir Charles died, people have told me some very serious things. Several people have seen an animal running on the moor at night. It looks like an enormous hound. Everyone agrees that it was a huge creature, larger than any dog could be. And, Mr Holmes, the animal shone with a strange light, like a ghost. I have questioned these people carefully. None of them are crazy or drink too much. They all tell exactly the same story. Although these people have not seen the thing up close, it is exactly like the hellhound of the Baskerville story. The people are very frightened, and only the bravest man will cross the moor at night."</p>

	<p>"And you, a man of science, believe that the creature is supernatural&#151;a ghost, or something from another world?" asked Holmes.</p>

	<p>"I don't know what I believe," said Dr Mortimer.</p>

	<p>"But surely, Doctor, you must think that the footprints were made by a living animal, not a ghost?"</p>

	<p>"When the hound first appeared two hundred and fifty years ago, it was real enough to tear out Sir Hugo's throat and kill him. But, the animal was a strange and frightening hellhound!" said Dr Mortimer.</p>

	<p>"Dr Mortimer, if you and the people of Devonshire really believe that Sir Charles' death was caused by a ghost, my detective work cannot help you," Holmes said seriously.</p>

	<p>"Maybe this is true," said Mortimer. "But you can help by advising me what to do for Sir Henry Baskerville, even if you cannot help more." Dr Mortimer looked at his watch. "He arrives in London on the train in a little over an hour."</p>

	<p>"Sir Henry is now the head of the Baskerville family?" asked Holmes.</p>

	<p>"Yes," said Dr Mortimer. "He is the last of the Baskervilles. The family lawyers have found him in America, and told him everything. He has come to England immediately by ship. He landed this morning. Now, Mr Holmes, what do you think I should tell him to do?"</p>

	<p>"Why doesn't he just go to the family home?" asked Holmes.</p>

	<p>"Because, Mr Holmes, too many Baskervilles have died horrible deaths there. No matter what the reason is, this is a plain fact. Perhaps we would be putting Sir Henry in too much danger. But Sir Charles' good work must go on. If it does not, then all the people on the Baskerville lands will be much poorer. If the Baskerville family leaves the Hall, the whole area will be ruined! I don't know what to do. That is why I came to you for advice."</p>

	<p>Holmes thought for a few moments. Then he said: "You think it is too dangerous for any Baskerville to live at the Hall, because of this terrible Hound. I think you should go and meet Sir Henry Baskerville at the train station. Do not tell him anything about our discussion. In twenty-four hours, I will tell you what I think you should do. At ten o'clock tomorrow morning, I would like you to bring Sir Henry Baskerville here."</p>

	<p>Dr Mortimer got up from his chair and shook hands with both of us. As he was leaving the room, Holmes said: "One more question, Dr Mortimer. You said that before Sir Charles' death, there were other people who saw this strange animal on the moor?"</p>

	<p>"Yes," said Mortimer.</p>

	<p>"Since Sir Charles' death, has anyone seen the animal?"</p>

	<p>"I do not know of anyone who has seen it."</p>

	<p>"Thank you, Dr Mortimer. Good morning."</p>

	<p>After Mortimer had left us, Holmes sat down in his chair. He looked pleased and immediately asked for his pipe. He always acted this way when a case interested him.</p>

	<p>I knew that he wanted to think about everything he had heard. So I left the house and went out for the day. When I came back, the room was full of thick, sweet smelling smoke from Holmes' pipe.</p>

	<p>"Well, Holmes, what do you think of the story? Have you solved the mystery?" I asked him,smiling.</p>

	<p>"It is hard to say. Take, for example, the change in the footprints. Did Sir Charles walk on his toes down the path of trees? Why would he do that? That would be ridiculous. The truth is, he was running&#151;running for his life. He ran until his heart stopped&#151;from fear, Watson. He was frightened to death."</p>

	<p>"What was he running from?" I asked.</p>

	<p>"That is the difficult question," said Holmes. "I think he was frightened by something, and began to run. He was so scared that he didn't know what he was doing. That explains why he ran away from the house, instead of towards it, where he would be safe. Then there is another question. Who was he waiting for that night? And why would he meet this person in the path of trees, the 'Yew Alley', and not in the house, like a normal person?"</p>

	<p>"You think he was waiting for someone?"</p>

	<p>"Sir Charles was old and rather sick. We know why he took a walk each evening; it was for his health. But why did he stand in the cold, on wet ground, for five or ten minutes? Dr Mortimer cleverly saw the cigar ash on the ground, so we know how long Sir Charles stood there. And, Watson, we know that he was deathly afraid of being outside at night, because of his belief in the Hound of the Baskervilles. So it is extremely unlikely that he waited at the moor gate every evening. He must have been there for a special reason. I am beginning to understand some things, Watson. But I will say nothing until we meet Sir Henry Baskerville in the morning. Now, please give me my violin."</p>

	<p>I found Holmes' violin and he began to play. He had done all the thinking he could. Now he needed more details of the case to help him.</p>
