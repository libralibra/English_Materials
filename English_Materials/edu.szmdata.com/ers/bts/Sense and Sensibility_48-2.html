	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">E</span>linor now realized the difference between the expectation of an unpleasant event and the certainty of the event. She was still shocked and upset after hearing of the marriage. She had always hoped that while Edward was still single there was some hope of his ending the engagement to Lucy, but now there was no hope. She was not surprised that they had gotten married so quickly, as Lucy would most likely want to secure her marriage. They would soon be settled near Colonel Brandon's country home at Delaford!</p>

	<p>The next day, Elinor was shocked to see Edward arriving at the cottage. He looked pale and nervous when he arrived. He was silent for some time, so Elinor began speaking.</p>

	<p>"Is Mrs Ferrars in London?"</p>

	<p>"Yes, my mother is in London."</p>

	<p>"No, I meant Mrs Edward Ferrars," Elinor said quietly.</p>

	<p>"Perhaps you mean my brother, you mean Mrs&#151;Mrs Robert Ferrars."</p>

	<p>"Mrs Robert Ferrars!" Marianne exclaimed.</p>

	<p>"You must not know&#151;you may not have heard that my brother has recently married Miss Lucy Steele."</p>
