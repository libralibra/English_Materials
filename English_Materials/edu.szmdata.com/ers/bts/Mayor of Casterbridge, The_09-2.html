	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER NINE</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">M</span>ichael Henchard arranged a nice little home, for his wife and daughter, on the west side of Casterbridge. A very pretty area with lots of trees. He also hired a housekeeper to work for them.</p>

	<p>Not long after they moved in, the Mayor began paying them visits rather frequently. He was always careful not to show any emotion around his daughter, in order to keep his past a secret.</p>

	<p>When, one day, Elizabeth was not at home, Mr Henchard asked his wife when she would like to remarry. Looking around the apartment at all the expensive furniture, she said, "I don't feel comfortable accepting all this from you. It's not exactly the way I thought that things would be."</p>

	<p>"This little place hardly costs me anything! Don't worry about it," he replied.</p>

	<p>Soon Henchard was visiting his wife so often that the people in town began to take notice. People began to talk about the Mayor being in love. In truth, everyone found it a little strange that Henchard should love such a simple woman. Some guessed that it had nothing to do with love. They guessed that something must have been arranged between the Henchard and Newson families. The boys in town called Mrs Newson "The Ghost" because her skin was so white. The Mayor noticed this and it made him angry, but he did his best to control himself and not say anything. He was determined to make it up to his wife for having behaved so terribly in the past and to provide a nice home for his daughter. Marrying a woman who was beneath him was a way for the man to punish himself a bit in front of all of society.</p>

	<p>Soon the wedding day came and Mr Farfrae acted as the Mayor's best man. The wedding day marked a big change in both Elizabeth's and Mrs Henchard's lives. Michael treated them both very well and did everything in his power to make them comfortable and happy. He even had parts of the house repainted for them.</p>

	<p>The change in lifestyle was very good for Elizabeth. She began to bloom. Although she was not well educated, it became clear that she was an intelligent woman. And her appearance improved over time, as well. In fact, she became rather beautiful. Unlike most women in her situation, she did not wildly dress herself in ridiculous clothing in order to seem fashionable. First of all, she was much too aware of the way that fortune and misfortune can come and go for anyone. Having, up to this point, lived such a hard life, she knew that her luck might change once again. No, Elizabeth eased slowly into her new lifestyle much like a cat might enter a room it has never been in before. Fortunately, she proved to have a natural talent for picking out clothing that suited her best.</p>

	<p>Henchard could not believe how attractive she had become. One day, while having lunch with his family, he could not help commenting, "Susan, I seem to remember you saying Elizabeth would have black hair when she grew up."</p>

	<p>"Hm. I don't remember saying that," she replied, kicking her husband under the table.</p>

	<p>When their daughter had left the table, Michael was the first to speak.</p>

	<p>"Goodness! I almost ruined everything, didn't I? Sorry about that, dear. Now, listen. I've been thinking. I'd like for Elizabeth to be called Miss Henchard instead of Miss Newson. I'm her real father, after all."</p>

	<p>"Yes&#160;... well, I'll have to ask her if she wouldn't mind changing her name," answered Mrs Henchard. She was afraid that her daughter might feel it was insulting to Mr Newson. When asked by her mother, Elizabeth kept her feelings about it hidden, saying that she would accept the change if Mr Henchard wanted it. However, in the end, because he did not continue to insist, she did not pursue the change and remained Miss Newson.</p>

	<p>Mr Henchard's company, meanwhile, began to run better than ever before. Now that Mr Farfrae had taken control over the office, everything was much more organized. The Scotsman proved himself to be a very able man and Mr Henchard was very happy to have him around. The two men could almost always be seen together, as Mr Henchard enjoyed the Scotsman's company. Elizabeth, who could observe the men at their work from her second-floor bedroom window, occasionally noticed that Mr Farfrae did not always like to be around his boss. It seemed that he enjoyed his independence and sometimes felt that Henchard took away some of his freedom.</p>

	<p>One day, Elizabeth received a piece of paper asking her to come to a granary on the other side of town. There was no name on it. She assumed that it must have to do with her father's business, so she kept the appointment. When she arrived, no one was there. Moments later, she could see Donald Farfrae coming toward the granary. A strong desire to hide came over Elizabeth and she went inside the granary before the Scotsman could notice her. She could see from behind the granary door that he too had a note in his hand. She leaned against the door, trying to listen to his movements while he waited. Then the latch on the door suddenly slipped, causing the door to open, and Elizabeth fell forward onto the ground.</p>

	<p>"Miss Newson! Are you all right?" asked Mr Farfrae, "I was just waiting for you."</p>

	<p>"Ah, yes. Hello. I'm fine&#160;...&#160;" she said, getting back on her feet. "Waiting for me, did you say?"</p>

	<p>"Yes, I got your note asking me to come."</p>

	<p>"But I thought that you had written to me!" Elizabeth replied.</p>

	<p>"It seems that someone is playing a joke on us!" cried the Scotsman. "I've no time for jokes. And I'm sure you haven't the time either."</p>

	<p>"Oh, I wasn't terribly busy, actually," she said, and, after a few moments of uncomfortable silence, added, "Don't you miss your home in Scotland? You seemed to miss it so much when you sang at the Three Mariners."</p>

	<p>"Not really. I just like singing. Would you like me to sing it again for you now?" he asked.</p>

	<p>"Thank you, but I'd better be getting back home."</p>

	<p>"Well, anytime you'd like to hear it, just tell me. I'd be happy to sing it for you." Then, looking at her clothing, he said, "It seems you got a little dirty from your fall earlier. Here, let me get some of that off before it ruins your clothes."</p>

	<p>He then began to blow the dirt from her back, her neck, and her hair. When he finished, he said, "There, now. That's better. Can I get an umbrella for you?"</p>

	<p>"No, thank you. I really must be going," Elizabeth replied.</p>

	<p>The Scotsman watched as she quickly walked away and then began to sing an old Scottish tune to himself.</p>
