	<p class="storyTitle">8. The Birth of Isaac</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">A</span>lmost a year later, Sarah gave birth to her promised son. Abraham named the boy Isaac just as God had told him to. He understood why God had chosen that name. Isaac means "laughter," and when the baby was born there was much laughter and joy in Abraham's house.</p>

	<p>Sarah loved her son very much and was very protective of him. When he was a little older, Isaac liked playing outside. Ishmael, Isaac's half-brother, was much older than him. He liked to play rougher games than little Isaac.</p>

	<p>One day Ishmael began to tease Isaac. Sarah saw what happened and was angry. She went to tell Abraham. Sarah insisted that Ishmael and his mother, Hagar, be sent away. That bothered Abraham because Ishmael was also his son. He didn't want him to go away.</p>

	<p>"Don't worry about your son, Ishmael," God said to Abraham. "I will care for him and his mother. Ishmael will grow to lead a great nation of his own."</p>

	<p>So Abraham agreed with Sarah's plan.</p>
