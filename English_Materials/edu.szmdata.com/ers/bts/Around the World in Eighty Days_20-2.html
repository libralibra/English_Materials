	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER TWENTY</p>

	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">Fix Comes Face to Face with Phineas Fogg</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">M</span>r Fogg did not know that he was in danger of missing the steamer. He was taking Aouda around the streets of the English quarter. After making some purchases, they returned to the hotel. After dinner, Mr Fogg read The Times and the Illustrated London News.</p>

	<p>If anything could surprise him, it would be not to see his servant at bedtime. Passepartout did not return in the morning, either. Mr Fogg took his bag, called Aouda, and left for the docks.</p>

	<p>It was then eight o'clock; at half past nine the Carnatic would leave the harbor. When they reached the dock Mr Fogg learned that the Carnatic had sailed the evening before. He had expected to find the steamer and his servant. He did not show any disappointment, though.</p>

	<p>At this moment Fix appeared. "Where you a passenger on the Rangoon, sir, like me?"</p>

	<p>"I was, sir," replied Mr Fogg coldly.</p>

	<p>"Pardon me; I thought I might find your servant here."</p>

	<p>"Do you know where he is, sir?" asked Aouda anxiously.</p>

	<p>"What!" replied Fix, showing surprise. "Is he not with you? Did you intend to sail on the Carnatic?"</p>

	<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

	<p>"So did I, madam, and I am disappointed. The Carnatic left Hong Kong twelve hours early, without any notice. Now we just wait a week for another steamer."</p>

	<p>Fix was alarmed when he heard Mr Fogg say, "But there are other ships besides the Carnatic."</p>

	<p>Aouda took his arm and walked to the docks. Fix followed them. For three hours Phineas Fogg wandered about the docks, but he had no luck. Fix began to hope again. Then, a sailor walked up to Mr Fogg.</p>

	<p>"Are you looking for a boat, sir?"</p>

	<p>"Have you a boat ready to sail?"</p>

	<p>"Yes, sir. A pilot-boat. The best in the harbor. Will you look at her?"</p>

	<p>"Yes."</p>

	<p>"You will be happy with her. Is it for a pleasure trip?"</p>

	<p>"No, for a voyage. Will you take me to Yokohama?"</p>

	<p>"Are you joking, sir?"</p>

	<p>"No, I have missed the Carnatic, and I must get to Yokohama by the 14th at the latest."</p>

	<p>"I am sorry," said the sailor, "but it is impossible. I can't risk my boat on such a long journey."</p>

	<p>Fix breathed easily.</p>

	<p>"But," added the pilot, "it might be done another way."</p>

	<p>Fix stopped breathing.</p>

	<p>"How?" asked Mr Fogg.</p>

	<p>"By going to Shanghai. It is only eight hundred miles from here. We would not have to sail wide of the Chinese coast."</p>

	<p>"Pilot," said Mr Fogg, "I must take the American steamer at Yokohama, and not at Shanghai."</p>

	<p>"Why not? The San Francisco steamer does not start from Yokohama. It puts in at Yokohama, but it starts from Shanghai."</p>

	<p>"You are sure of that?" When does the boat leave Shanghai?"</p>

	<p>"On the 11th, at seven in the morning. We have four days before us; if we had good luck and a southwest wind, we could make those eight hundred miles to Shanghai."</p>

	<p>"And you could go&#151;"</p>

	<p>"In an hour."</p>

	<p>"It is a bargain. Are you the master of the boat?"</p>

	<p>"Yes; John Bunsby, master of the Tankadere."</p>

	<p>Phineas Fogg turned to Fix, and said, "If you would like to join us&#151;"</p>

	<p>"Thanks, sir."</p>

	<p>"Very well. In half an hour we will go on board."</p>

	<p>"But poor Passepartout?" said Aouda, who was worried about the servant.</p>

	<p>"I shall try to find him," replied Phineas Fogg.</p>

	<p>Fix nervously went to the boat. Phineas Fogg asked about Passepartout at the police station and the French consulate. At three o'clock they returned to the boat.</p>

	<p>The Tankadere was a neat little boat weighing twenty tons. It was built like a racing boat. The crew of the Tankadere was made up of John Bunsby, the master, and four strong sailors that knew the Chinese seas.</p>

	<p>Phineas Fogg and Aouda went on board, where they found Fix. The room was small, but neat.</p>

	<p>"I am sorry to have nothing better to offer you," said Mr Fogg to Fix.</p>

	<p>The detective was embarrassed. "It's certain," he thought, "though he is a rascal, he's a polite one!"</p>

	<p>At ten past three the boat raised the English flag and left the dock. Mr Fogg and Aouda were on deck, but they did not see Passepartout.</p>
