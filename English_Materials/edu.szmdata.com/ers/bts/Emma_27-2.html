	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">E</span>mma was very pleased with the Coles' dinner party. The next day, Harriet came to the Woodhouse home for a visit.</p>

	<p>"Oh, I wish I could play as well as you and Miss Fairfax!" Harriet told her friend.</p>

	<p>"Harriet, you know Miss Fairfax's playing is well above mine."</p>

	<p>"Oh no, I think you play better than Miss Fairfax."</p>

	<p>"That is quite impossible, Harriet."</p>

	<p>After some time, Harriet told Emma she had heard the night before that Mr Martin had dined with the Coxes, who have an unmarried daughter, Anne Cox. This news upset the poor girl that evening.</p>

	<p>"Perhaps Anne Cox would be very glad to marry Mr Martin," Harriet said, worriedly.</p>

	<p>"That is possible; she is the most impolite girl in Highbury."</p>

	<p>That day, Harriet had to return to Ford's, where she had last seen Mr Martin. Emma thought she should go with her friend; she was afraid Harriet might see Mr Martin. While at Ford's, the girls met Mrs Weston and Miss Bates, who invited them to the Bates' home to hear Jane play the pianoforte. Jane was waiting at the Bates' home with Mr Frank Churchill and Mrs Bates.</p>

	<p>On the walk back to the Bates' home, Miss Bates told the women about Mr Knightley's visit to their home yesterday. He had apples brought to the house; he knew the Bates often cooked apples, and thought they might enjoy some. Emma remembered her conversation with Mrs Weston; perhaps Mr Knightley was in love with Jane Fairfax.</p>
