	<p class="storyTitle">55. Two Sons</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">T</span>he parable of the runaway son is a story of regret and forgiveness. Jesus told this story to the Pharisees, so they would understand that even people who have done bad things are worthy of God's love.</p>

	<p>"A man had two sons. One day the youngest son decided he wanted to go out on his own," Jesus told them. "He asked the father to give him his share of the family inheritance. So the father divided his wealth between the two boys, and the younger one left home for the city."</p>

	<p>"Soon the young boy spent everything he had because there were many wrong ways to spend money in the city."</p>

	<p>"So he had to take a job tending pigs. He hated the job and he barely made enough money to buy food with. He was hungry every day. He began to think about the servants back on his father's farm. 'At least they get three square meals a day,' he said to himself."</p>

	<p>"So he decided to swallow his pride and go back home to his father."</p>

	<p>"The father missed his son very much," Jesus continued.</p>

	<p>"When he looked down the road one day and saw his son coming toward him, he ran and kissed him."</p>

	<p>"'I have committed many sins, Father,' said the boy. 'I am no longer worthy of your love.'"</p>

	<p>"But the father would not listen to the boy. He ordered the servants to bring out a fine robe for him and plan a big feast. They would cook up the meat from the fattest calf in the field."</p>

	<p>"The older son heard all the commotion and asked what was going on. When he heard that the feast was to honor his brother, he got very angry."</p>

	<p>"'I have stayed with you and served you all this time,' he said to his father. 'But you have never rewarded me with such a great feast.'"</p>

	<p>"The father told him he should be rejoicing at his brother's return. 'Your brother was dead, but now he is alive again,' he said. 'We should be glad that he has found his way back to us.'"</p>
