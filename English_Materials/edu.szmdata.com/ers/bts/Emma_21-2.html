	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">E</span>mma could not forgive Jane. On the walk home, however, Mr Knightley did not realize Emma was upset.</p>

	<p>"A very pleasant evening," began Mr George Knightley.</p>

	<p>"Yes, quite a pleasant evening. I was pleased with the many questions I asked Miss Fairfax, and amused at how little information I received," Emma replied.</p>

	<p>The next morning, Mr Knightley arrived at the Woodhouse home with news for Emma. Miss Bates arrived just as Mr Knightley was going to tell Emma the news. Miss Bates interrupted, however.</p>

	<p>"Have you heard the news?" she asked. "Mr Elton is going to be married."</p>

	<p>Emma had not had time to think of Mr Elton, and was surprised, and felt embarrassed at hearing the news.</p>

	<p>"There is my news&#151;I thought it would interest you, Emma. He is going to be married to a Miss Hawkins," said Mr Knightley with a smile, knowing there was a secret between them.</p>

	<p>"I wish them happiness!" Emma exclaimed.</p>

	<p>"He is very young to get married," Mr Woodhouse observed.</p>

	<p>"A new neighbour for us all, Miss Woodhouse!" said Miss Bates joyfully. "Jane, you have never seen Mr Elton."</p>

	<p>"No, I have never seen Mr Elton," she responded without emotion.</p>

	<p>"Mr Elton has only been gone four weeks, he must have met Miss Hawkins recently," Emma said. "You are silent, Miss Fairfax, but I hope you are interested in this news."</p>

	<p>"When I have seen Mr Elton," replied Jane, "I shall be interested, but I must first meet him."</p>

	<p>Emma then realized she must tell Harriet the news before she finds out from others. A few moments later, Harriet arrived, looking rather upset.</p>

	<p>"Oh, Miss Woodhouse, I must speak with you at once," were Harriet's first words.</p>

	<p>Harriet had been walking to the Woodhouse home when it started to rain. She stopped at Ford's, a clothing shop in Highbury, to wait for the rain to stop. As she sat down, she saw Elizabeth Martin and her brother come in!</p>

	<p>"I was sitting near the door when Elizabeth saw me, but Mr Martin did not. She looked away, but soon he looked around the store and saw me. They began whispering. I think he was asking her to speak to me because she then came to greet me. She was very friendly. She said she was sorry we never see each other. Dear Miss Woodhouse, I was absolutely miserable! I wanted to leave, but it was raining outside. Then, he came to speak to me for a minute. Then, the rain stopped, so I said goodbye. As I was leaving, he followed me to say I should take the road near Mr Cole's home because it is safer. He was so pleasant and kind, and Elizabeth, too. Oh, Miss Woodhouse, I am so upset. Please make me feel comfortable again."</p>

	<p>This upset Emma because she knew she had to tell Harriet the news about Mr Elton's marriage, which would not comfort her dear friend. She pitied the Martins. They honestly cared about Harriet, although she hurt Mr Martin deeply. Then, Emma told Harriet the news of Mr Elton's marriage. Poor Harriet soon forgot about her seeing the Martins. She was curious and hurt after hearing the news of Mr Elton and his Miss Hawkins.</p>
