	<p class="storyTitle">68. Rising to Heaven</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">T</span>he last time that Jesus spoke to his disciples, he told them to wait in Jerusalem for a special visitor.</p>

	<p>"John the Baptist baptized with water," he said. "But you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit." The Holy Spirit would give the disciples power to do many good works and miracles just as Jesus had done.</p>

	<p>Some of Jesus' followers who were with the disciples asked Jesus when he would come back to lead his kingdom on earth. They wanted to know when he would become the king they hoped for.</p>

	<p>"It's not for you to know such things," he said. "Only God knows when that will happen."</p>

	<p>After Jesus finished speaking to them, they watched as he rose up into heaven, out of their sight. Two angels appeared next to them.</p>

	<p>"Why are you standing here, looking up at the clouds?" the angels asked. "This Jesus you have just watched go up into heaven will come back down to earth the same way someday."</p>
