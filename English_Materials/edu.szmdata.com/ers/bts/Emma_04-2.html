	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER FOUR</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">S</span>oon after the dinner party, Emma encouraged Harriet to visit Hartfield often. As the two girls spent more time together, they became close friends. Emma discovered that Harriet was useful to have nearby. Emma often went on walks through town, but needed a companion in the evenings. Harriet could join her at any time. Emma still missed Miss Taylor quite a bit, but realized that Harriet could be useful to her.</p>

	<p>Emma was curious about Harriet's parents, who were never mentioned. Emma asked many questions on the subject, but Harriet knew nothing. Harriet did not wish to know, therefore, Mrs Goddard had not told her. At first, the two often discussed Mrs Goddard, the teachers, and the other girls living at the school. But, after some time, Emma began to ask questions about the Martins. She knew Harriet thought they were wonderful people. Harriet loved talking about the Martins, particularly about young Mr Martin.</p>

	<p>"He had walked three miles one day to bring me some walnuts, because I told him I was fond of them!"</p>

	<p>Harriet also mentioned that Mrs Martin, one day, told her, "Whenever he married, he would make a good husband."</p>

	<p>Mr Martin had seen Miss Emma Woodhouse many times, but had never spoken to her. Emma, though, did not know him. There are many farmers that go through the town, and she does not make conversation with farmers. Emma advises her young friend that Mr Martin is too young to marry, and should wait to marry.</p>

	<p>"In six years, if he could meet with a good young woman in the same social class, with a little money, it would be very desirable."</p>

	<p>Harriet is quite surprised that Emma thought Mr Martin too young to marry. Emma advised her friend to be careful whom she marries, particularly because no one, not even herself, knows who her parents are. People may doubt if her parents were wealthy and well-educated, like Emma.</p>

	<p>"The misfortune of your birth ought to make you particularly careful as to your friends."</p>

	<p>Emma thought Harriet would listen to her advice, but Harriet was grateful for the attention to her.</p>

	<p>The next day, Emma and Harriet were on a walk when they saw Mr Martin walking. Mr Martin greeted Miss Woodhouse respectfully, and then smiled with pleasure at young Harriet. The two talked for a moment before Harriet and Miss Woodhouse continued on their walk.</p>

	<p>"Well, Miss Woodhouse, what do you think of him?"</p>

	<p>"He is very plain. I had expected him to have better manners."</p>

	<p>Emma then discussed the difference in manners between Mr Knightley, Mr Elton, and Mr Martin. Emma thought Mr Martin was not suitable for young Harriet. She believed Mr Elton would make a better husband for Harriet, with a comfortable, wealthy home.</p>
