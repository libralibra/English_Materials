	<p class="storyTitle">9. God's Plan for Ishmael</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">A</span>braham had given Hagar and Ishmael some food and water for their trip. They walked for many miles and soon their supplies ran out. There was nothing but sand all around them. They became very thirsty and weak.</p>

	<p>Hagar left her son lying beside a bush. She walked a little farther and sat down with her back to her son, weeping loudly.</p>

	<p>"Don't be afraid," God said to her. "Go and comfort your son."</p>

	<p>Then God opened her eyes and she saw a well. She went and brought water from it to Ishmael. Soon they were both strong enough to go on.</p>

	<p>Ishmael and Hagar made their home in a place called Paran. It was close to the country of Egypt. When Ishmael grew up, he married an Egyptian girl and they had many heirs.</p>

	<p>As God had promised, the children of Ishmael later formed a mighty nation and called themselves Arabs. Throughout all of history the Arabs and Isaac's people, the Jews, have fought with one another just like Ishmael and Isaac did as children.</p>
