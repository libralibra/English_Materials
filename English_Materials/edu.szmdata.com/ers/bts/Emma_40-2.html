	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER FORTY</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">A</span> few days after Harriet's adventure, she came one morning to Emma with a small package in her hand. She sat down, hesitated, and then began to speak:</p>

	<p>"Miss Woodhouse, I have something I would like to tell you."</p>

	<p>Emma was surprised and eager to listen.</p>

	<p>Harriet continued, "It seems like madness! I do not care now whether I see Mr Elton or not, although I would rather not see him. His wife is very charming, but disagreeable and with a bad temper. I am now going to destroy some things that were once priceless to me (She said, blushing as she spoke.). Dear Miss Woodhouse, do you remember the morning Mr Elton needed to write something. His pencil had no lead, which he intended on throwing away. I kept that pencil. Although, I knew after he married, I should not keep it, but I was still in love with him."</p>

	<p>"My poor Harriet, have you actually found happiness in keeping this?"</p>

	<p>"Yes, I was a fool, and quite ashamed now. I will now throw it into the fire, and there is an end. I will no longer think of Mr Elton."</p>

	<p>"And when," thought Emma, "will there be a beginning with Mr Churchill?"</p>

	<p>Emma believed, however, that Mr Churchill's saving Harriet on the road was the beginning.</p>

	<p>There was silence for some time, then Emma advised her friend on what sort of man to marry, but Harriet was upset, and did not want to listen.</p>

	<p>"I shall never marry," Harriet told her, sadly.</p>

	<p>After a few moments of silence, Emma replied with:</p>

	<p>"Do not let Mr Elton's cruel behaviour make you feel bad. You are a better person than him in many ways."</p>

	<p>Then, Emma realized Harriet was no longer thinking of Mr Elton. She was thinking of a man far better than Mr Elton, a man who had recently saved her.</p>

	<p>"I am not at all surprised at you, Harriet. This man, whose name I shall not say, touched your heart when he helped you. He is of the highest class in society, and quite wealthy, so he is your superior in that way, but a relationship with him is not impossible. Let his behaviour guide your emotions."</p>

	<p>Harriet was grateful for Emma's kind advice, and gently kissed her hand to show her thanks.</p>
