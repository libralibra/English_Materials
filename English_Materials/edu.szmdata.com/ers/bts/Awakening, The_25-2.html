	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">E</span>dna found that she could only work well on sunny days. She understood now that her intention was not to master the art of painting. She simply enjoyed the act of painting, nothing more. So she let herself make mistakes and did not get upset when something did not turn out as she had hoped.</p>

	<p>When it was not sunny, she would either visit friends she had met at Grand Isle, or she would stay at home and spend the day thinking. Her thoughts on these days made her uncomfortable. It gave her the feeling that, as time continued to pass, she was missing opportunities. Other times, she had more positive thoughts. She believed that, because she was still so young, there would be plenty of time to make her life better.</p>

	<p>One day, Alcee Arobin and Mrs Highcamp, two people she had met at the horseracing track with her father, invited her to accompany them to the races. Mrs James Highcamp was a woman in her forties, who used her pretty, young daughter to attract fashionable young men. Alcee Arobin was an example of this. He was quite popular in society and could often be seen at the races, the theater, and the most expensive clubs. He was a charming fellow, who was quiet, yet easy to talk with. He dressed as any man of society might be expected to dress.</p>

	<p>It had actually been Alcee Arobin's idea to invite Mrs Pontellier to come to the races. Ever since he had talked with her at the track with her father, he had a very high opinion of Edna.</p>

	<p>Edna knew everything about horseracing. Having grown up on a farm in Kentucky, she was very familiar with horses. She always bet a lot of money and would almost always win. People all around her watched her carefully, trying to find out which horse she thought was the best to bet on. Seeing her so knowledgeable and sure of herself made Arobin even more attracted to her.</p>

	<p>Later on, they had a dinner with the Highcamp family. It was not very fun. Mr and Mrs Highcamp were very quiet and serious people. Their daughter played piano for Edna and Alcee. However, it was performed just like a Highcamp would be expected to play it, unemotionally.</p>

	<p>Arobin gave her a ride back home late in the evening. He made a very weak attempt to come into her home, by asking for some matches from her. They talked for a short time inside and then after promising to take her again to the races, the young man left.</p>

	<p>He kept his promise and came by a few days later. He was alone this time. When asked about Mrs Highcamp, he lied and said that they were supposed to pick her up on the way to the track. Of course, the truth was that he had never mentioned going to the track to Mrs Highcamp. When they went to the Highcamp home, no one was there. Arobin pretended to be disappointed. Edna suggested going to the track anyway.</p>

	<p>It was a very interesting afternoon. Edna became excited again. Arobin was a very easy-going person. The two of them became closer and closer until soon they were sharing more personal information with one another.</p>

	<p>That evening, they talked over dinner at Edna's. As he was about to leave, Arobin told Edna how much he wished that they could have met at a younger age. He told her how bad he was when he was young, and walking up close to her, raised the sleeve of his shirt to show the mark left by a knife on his arm. It was from a fight when he was nineteen. She gently touched the mark and, without knowing what she was doing, took hold of his hand. She then realized what she had done and quickly walked away from him.</p>

	<p>"Seeing such marks always makes me feel ill!" she said.</p>

	<p>"Sorry, Edna. I didn't realize it was so disgusting," he said walking after her. Then, taking her hand in his, he told her, "Goodnight." However, he did not leave. Instead, he kept looking into her eyes.</p>

	<p>"When shall we go to the races again?"</p>

	<p>"I haven't time for the races. I must paint," she answered, trying to sound cold.</p>

	<p>"Oh, yes, you were going to show me your work. Can I come by tomorrow to have a look?" he asked.</p>

	<p>"No. You said goodbye to me, why haven't you gone? God, I can't stand you!" She said, aware of the falseness in her voice.</p>

	<p>"But why do you say such things? I didn't realize that I had upset you somehow." Arobin then kissed Edna's hand.</p>

	<p>Edna gathered as much strength as she could and managed to say, "That's quite enough, Mr Arobin. I'm afraid that I have accidentally led you to believe that I wanted something else from you other than friendship. Please go."</p>

	<p>"I enjoyed our time together. I have become very attracted to you. But don't worry about it. If you don't want me to stay, then I won't. I just hope that we may see each other again soon. Will we?" he asked.</p>

	<p>Edna did not answer.</p>

	<p>After he had gone Edna could not help feeling that she had done something terrible behind Robert's back. She wondered if he would be angry with her. Her husband never once entered her thoughts. She did not love him. Alcee, too, was nothing to her, however, his touch and kisses on her hand made her feel like she was drunk.</p>
