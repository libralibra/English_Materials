	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER THIRTY-NINE</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">T</span>he Miss Dashwoods had now been in town more than two months and Marianne wished to be gone. She missed her mother and sister, as well as the quiet country life. When the girls began talking about going back home, Mrs Palmer suggested they go to Cleveland for a visit before going home. Cleveland, however, was in Somersetshire, near Magna Combe, Willoughby's county home.</p>

	<p>"Cleveland!" she cried. "No, I cannot go to Cleveland."</p>

	<p>Elinor understood her sister's reason for not wishing to go to Cleveland, but she knew that traveling such a great distance would be safer with another family. Cleveland was not far from Barton, perhaps only a day's journey. They would, as well, not be staying long at Cleveland, and would return home shortly, so Marianne finally agreed.</p>

	<p>One morning, Colonel Brandon was visiting Mrs Jennings and her young guests, when he requested to talk to Elinor alone. He began speaking of his country home, explaining that it was not large, but was comfortable for a family. Elinor was quite confused as to his reasons for telling her of his home. After a short time, however, he explained that he would be willing to employ Edward there as his minister. The income was only two hundred pounds a year, but he wished for Elinor to offer this to him. What was she to do? It pained her to think of Edward marrying someone as impolite and deceitful as Lucy, but now she was expected to offer this income, so the two could, indeed, marry.</p>
