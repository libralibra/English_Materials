	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER ELEVEN</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">E</span>mma realized that Mr Elton must now pursue Harriet himself; Emma should no longer be involved in their love affair. Besides, she had something else to occupy her time for the next ten days. Her sister, Isabella, and her husband, Mr John Knightley, were coming for a visit with their children. The Knightleys had not come to Hartfield in quite a while, so Mr Woodhouse was particularly excited for the visit.</p>

	<p>Mrs John Knightley was a gentle, little woman. She had friendly, quiet manners, similar to her father's. She worried about her children often, and respected her husband.</p>

	<p>Mr John Knightley, was a tall, clever gentleman. He was intelligent and quick, two qualities his wife did not have. His sister-in-law, Emma, noticed that he offended his wife, although Isabella herself did not. Mr Knightley was not patient with Mr Woodhouse's strange habits, although he cared deeply about his father-in-law.</p>

	<p>Soon after the family arrived at the Woodhouses', they all sat down together. Mr Woodhouse sighed and shook his head.</p>

	<p>"Ah, poor Miss Taylor."</p>

	<p>"Oh yes," cried Isabella, "You and poor Emma, what a sad loss for you both."</p>

	<p>"But, do you see her often?" asked Isabella.</p>

	<p>"Not nearly enough."</p>

	<p>"Oh papa, we see either Mr or Mrs Weston everyday, usually we see them both," replied Emma.</p>

	<p>"Yes, we do see Mrs Weston often, but she must always leave again," said Mr Woodhouse, sadly.</p>

	<p>"But, papa, Mr Weston would be so upset if she did not return. You forgot about poor Mr Weston," Emma reminded her father.</p>

	<p>Mr John Knightley soon interrupted, "I being a husband, should remind you that a man needs his wife around him."</p>

	<p>"I believe Miss Taylor is the most fortunate woman in the world, except for her leaving Hartfield," added his wife.</p>
