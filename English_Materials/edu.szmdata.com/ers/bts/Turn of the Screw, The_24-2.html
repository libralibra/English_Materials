	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">"T</span>hat's not entirely true, is it?"</p>

	<p>"Well, no, I guess it's not. Others are here as well."</p>

	<p>"Yes, that's right. There are the others."</p>

	<p>"But they are not really very important, are they?"</p>

	<p>I could feel my face turning white.</p>

	<p>"What do you mean by 'important'?"</p>

	<p>"Oh, I don't know."</p>

	<p>He then turned back around toward the window and looked out at the sad, gray, November day. I felt, at this moment, that he could see something that I could not. But he seemed different to me now. He did not look as confident or as happy as before. The idea suddenly came to my mind that he was looking for something out of the window. Was it possible that he was as blind to them as I now was? Was it possible that he could not see them? A feeling of hope suddenly ran through me. Miles then turned away from the window and looked at me. He seemed nervous and troubled. "I'm happy that this house is healthy for me."</p>

	<p>"Yes, it seems that you have been spending more time getting familiar with the house lately," I said, trying to keep up my courage.</p>

	<p>"Truly. I've walked many many kilometers around the property."</p>

	<p>"And how do you feel about this new freedom of yours?"</p>

	<p>A smile appeared on his face. "How do you feel about it?" he said. However, he did not give me time to answer. "Between you and me, I think you are more lonely. I hope being here with me at this house is not too boring for you."</p>

	<p>"Not at all. Why do you think I continue to work here? I very much enjoy your company."</p>

	<p>The look on his face suddenly became more serious. And I felt at that moment that his beauty was greater than ever before. "That's the reason you continue to work here? To be with me?"</p>

	<p>"Of course, I'd like to stay with you until we can find a good school for you to attend. I told you before, the night that I visited you in your room, that I would do anything to help you."</p>

	<p>"I remember. But I think you said that because you wanted me to do something."</p>

	<p>"Yes, that's true. I wanted things to change after that, but they did not change, did they?"</p>

	<p>"But I think what you wanted was for me to talk with you."</p>

	<p>"Yes, exactly! I wanted, and I still want, for you to tell me what you are thinking about."</p>

	<p>"So that's the real reason you continue to work here," he said with a laugh.</p>

	<p>I could hear many different things in his voice now. I could hear anger, but I could also hear somewhere inside of him that he wanted to give in to me. He wanted my help.</p>

	<p>"I admit that I'm here for that reason."</p>

	<p>"So you still want me to talk? Right here? Now?"</p>

	<p>"Why not?"</p>

	<p>His eyes searched about the room suddenly. And for the first time, I saw fear in his face. His fear was not of the others, but of me.</p>

	<p>"I can see that you want to go outside now."</p>

	<p>"Yes, terribly," he said suddenly smiling. His hands began to play with the hat he was holding. His discomfort made me feel guilty. Was it right to make such a special child feel so uncomfortable? Looking back, I now see not just how frightened he was of me, but how frightened I was of him, as well. We were like two enemies waiting to attack each other. "I promise," The boy said, "I will talk with you about everything. But I must tell you later."</p>

	<p>"Why can't you tell me now?"</p>

	<p>He then looked away from me, back out the window. Not a single sound could be heard in the room. He then turned his eyes to mine, and said, "I must go speak with one of our servants."</p>

	<p>He was lying to me again. "Fine. But before you go, I have one favor to ask you."</p>

	<p>"Yes, what is it?"</p>

	<p>"It's very small, really. Could you tell me if you did something with my letter yesterday?"</p>
