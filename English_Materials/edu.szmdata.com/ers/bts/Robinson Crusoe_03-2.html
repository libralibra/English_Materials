	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER THREE</p>

	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">Captured!</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">F</span>or some time, I thought about returning to York. My short time at sea had been exciting, but I could easily have drowned in one of those storms! But I knew if I returned, my father would be angry and my friends would all laugh at me. So I decided to stay at sea, at least for some time. I left for London immediately.</p>

	<p>A few days after I arrived in London, I met some people who quickly became my friends. One of them was a ship's captain. He told me that he was about to sail for the far off country of Guinea, on the coast of Africa. He wanted to do business with the Africans.</p>

	<p>"You should come with me," he said.</p>

	<p>I thought about sailing through storms like the ones I had experienced. "I don't know," I said.</p>

	<p>"You can travel for free," he went on.</p>

	<p>I thought about Tom's father's warning. What if I really was not supposed to be a merchant like my father?</p>

	<p>"There's good money to be made!" he said.</p>

	<p>Well, that decided me! We sailed a few days later.</p>

	<p>It did not take long to reach Africa. We had a calm sea and a good wind the whole way.</p>

	<p>At our first stop, I spent some of my money on some African jewelry and other goods. Then, when we stopped at other places on the coast, I traded the jewelry for even better things. Then, I used those finer things to bargain for gold dust.</p>

	<p>By the time we sailed for England, I had more than five pounds of gold in my bag. When I returned to London I sold that gold for three hundred pounds! This was a lot of money. My father would have been proud of me! Maybe I was not so bad at doing business after all.</p>

	<p>Sadly when we returned to England, my friend the captain became very sick and died.</p>

	<p>"What are you going to do now, Robinson?" his wife asked me at the funeral. "Are you going to go back to York?"</p>

	<p>I shook my head. "No," I said. "I'm sailing back to Africa."</p>

	<p>"What!" she cried. "You're going to risk all your money for another adventure?"</p>

	<p>"Not all," I said. "I'm only taking one hundred pounds with me. Will you keep my other two hundred for me?"</p>

	<p>"Certainly I will," she said.</p>

	<p>A week later, I was back at sea. It felt wonderful. The weather was good and soon we reached the Canary Islands, near the northern African coast.</p>

	<p>One day, when we were near the king of Morocco's lands, the ship's watcher said, "I see a ship ahead of us!"</p>

	<p>"That's no ordinary trading ship," cried one of the men. "That's a pirate ship!"</p>

	<p>We tried to sail quickly to escape the ship, but it came toward us quickly. Soon, it was so close that we could see the faces of the pirates clearly.</p>

	<p>"They're Turks!" someone cried. Turks were dangerous and we were afraid of them.</p>

	<p>Just as the man spoke, the pirates fired a cannon at our ship.</p>

	<p>We tried to shoot them with our few guns, but it was soon clear that the pirates were much stronger than we were. As they came up beside our ship, they ran aboard shouting. We could not stop them, and since we had few people and almost no weapons, we decided not to fight them.</p>

	<p>The pirates took control of our ship, and sailed it to a place called Sallee.</p>

	<p>"You, boy! What's your name?" the Turkish captain said. He spoke very good English, and pulled my hair so hard I thought it would fall out.</p>

	<p>"Robinson Crusoe," I said angrily.</p>

	<p>"You don't look like an ordinary sailor," he said.</p>

	<p>"I'm not a sailor. I'm a merchant!"</p>

	<p>"Oh, no, you're not," said the pirate. He smiled. "You're my slave."</p>

	<p>And so the Turkish captain took me to his large, beautiful house by the sea, where I began to work for him.</p>

	<p>My new master made me work around the house cleaning and sweeping. I did things that other people had always done for me.</p>

	<p>My life wasn't so bad. Although I was not free, my new master was usually kind, and treated me well. I did not have to work in the fields all day, like other slaves. But there was never a time when I did not think about my freedom.</p>

	<p>One morning, when I had been in the Turk's house for a month, the captain came up to me while I was working in the garden.</p>

	<p>"We're going fishing, and we'll take that young Moroccan boy with us." he said.</p>

	<p>I had fished before, when I was a child. Sitting by a stream waiting for a fish to catch is a happy way to spend the day. But the Turk's way of fishing was very different.</p>

	<p>We traveled through the water in a little fishing boat. After about half an hour at sea, he told me and Xury, the Moroccan boy to start fishing. When we pulled our fishing lines in, there was a fish on every hook! Soon the bottom of the boat was full of fish.</p>

	<p>My master, Xury, and I went fishing many times. Soon, I became better at this kind of fishing than the Turk.</p>

	<p>One day, when I had been the Turk's slave for several months, we were out fishing when a thick, gray fog suddenly appeared. The fog was so thick that I could hardly see Xury and the Turk, who were sitting in the boat with me.</p>

	<p>For many hours we floated in the thick fog. When it finally disappeared, we were very far out at sea. It took us two hours to reach the Turk's house.</p>

	<p>"Well, Robinson," said the Turk, "the next time we go out fishing we will take food and water with us, in case we are trapped in that fog again. We will also take guns. Who knows what sort of horrible sea monsters we might find? And if we see a passing bird, then we can shoot her for our dinner!"</p>
