	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER SEVENTEEN</p>

	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">First Assistant</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">O</span>ne day Julien was sitting alone with Mrs de R&#x00EA;nal. He was thinking about the difficulty of taking on a profession. "Ah!" he said, "Napoleon was great for the young men of France. What will we do without him?"</p>

	<p>He saw the cold look on her face. He had forgotten she was rich. Quickly he said that he had heard Fouqu&#xE9; say those words.</p>

	<p>"Well, then don't talk to people like that any more!" she said.</p>

	<p>This made Julien calmer and more careful. Mrs de R&#x00EA;nal was surprised by his words. Men like Mr de R&#x00EA;nal said that too much education for the lower class might turn them into revolutionaries.</p>

	<p>Julien began asking Mrs de R&#x00EA;nal questions about society. He learned much from her about politics in France and in Verri&#xE8;res. This was very interesting to him. It was even more interesting than the books Fouqu&#xE9; gave him. His lover's beauty kept him from thinking about his ambition.</p>

	<p>One day when they sat with the children, Mrs de R&#x00EA;nal looked into Julien's eyes. She saw how smart he was. She thought he would become a great man someday.</p>
