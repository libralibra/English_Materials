	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER FOUR</p>

	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">Father and Son</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">M</span>r de R&#x00EA;nal went the next morning to Old Sorel. Old Mr Sorel was very surprised by the Mayor's offer. When Sorel replied, he recited all the words of respect he knew while he tried to think. Why would an important person want to take his good-for-nothing son into his home?</p>

	<p>The mayor had a thought. If Sorel was not excited, Mr Valenod must have had the same idea and made the same offer! Sorel would not agree right then, however. He said he had to talk with his son.</p>

	<p>Sorel walked to the mill and called to his son. Julien did not answer. Sorel did not like his son; he was not strong like his brothers. And why was he always reading? Sorel found Julien sitting with a book in his hands. One hit from the father sent the book flying; the second struck Julien right in the face. Julien saw his favorite book in the river, ruined.</p>

	<p>Sorel's rough hands seized Julien, and the boy feared a beating. "Answer me without lying," the old peasant said.</p>
