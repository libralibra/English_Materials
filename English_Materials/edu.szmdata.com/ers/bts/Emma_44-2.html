	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER FORTY-FOUR</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">A</span>fter arriving home, Emma was still upset about her behaviour toward Miss Bates at Box Hill. She did not know how the rest of the party had viewed her remarks. To Emma, the Box Hill outing was destroyed by her terrible manners toward Miss Bates, and she could think of nothing else that evening. She decided she would no longer be impolite to dear Miss Bates. She would go to the Bates' home for a visit the next morning, and that visit would begin regular visits to Miss Bates.</p>

	<p>The next morning, Emma went early to visit Miss Bates. She hoped, as she rode past Mr Knightley's home, that he would see her on her way to the Bates' home to show better manners and more respectful behaviour to poor Miss Bates. She did not see Mr Knightley, however, and so continued on to see Miss Bates.</p>

	<p>The Bates' servant took quite a while to answer the door. As Emma waited for the door to open, she heard people inside whispering and moving through the house quickly.</p>

	<p>Finally, Mrs Bates came to the door, humble as usual, and looking confused.</p>

	<p>"I am afraid Jane is not very well," said she, "but I do not know, but my daughter tells me she is well. Miss Bates should be here in a moment. Please come in and sit down, Miss Woodhouse," Mrs Bates offered.</p>

	<p>Miss Bates came soon, looking happy and grateful for the visit. However, Emma quickly noticed that Miss Bates did not have her usual cheerfulness. Emma hoped that a few questions about Miss Fairfax might improve Miss Bates' mood.</p>

	<p>"Ah, Miss Woodhouse, how kind you are! I suppose you have heard the news, but it will be very difficult to say goodbye to our Jane, after having her here for so long. Now, she has a terrible headache, though, after writing such long letters this morning to Colonel Campbell and Mrs Dixon. I suppose this is quite fortunate for our Jane" (with tears in her eyes), "but the poor girl, she has such a headache! She is in great pain, and so she does not see how fortunate this news is to her. She is not able to come see you now; her headache is terrible. I want her to lie down upon the bed. I know she will be extremely sorry to not see you anymore, Miss Woodhouse." Miss Bates told her.</p>

	<p>Emma was interested in this news. She had, recently, become more kind to Jane, and now Emma felt only pity for Jane and her suffering.</p>

	<p>"Where is Miss Fairfax going?" Emma asked.</p>

	<p>"To a Mrs Smallridge&#151;a charming woman. Jane will soon take care of her three delightful little girls. She lives quite close to Mrs Elton's old home. Mrs Elton would not take Jane's refusal. She would not let Jane say 'no'. When Mrs Elton asked two days ago, at Mr Knightley's home, of Jane's future work, Mrs Elton suggested the family immediately. Jane refused; she was not going to decide till after the Campbell's return, which she told Mrs Elton several times. But Mrs Elton still refused Jane's answer. Yesterday evening, Jane finally decided to take the position with the Smallridge family."</p>

	<p>"You spent yesterday evening with Mrs Elton?"</p>

	<p>"Yes, all of us. Jane's new position with the Smallridges was decided at Box Hill between Mrs Elton and Jane."</p>

	<p>"Miss Fairfax had been making her decision all day, then?" Emma asked.</p>

	<p>"Yes, I suppose she did."</p>

	<p>"I hope this new position will calm poor Jane's fears. The family sounds wonderful."</p>

	<p>"Thank you, dear Miss Woodhouse. Yes, indeed, the Smallridges will make her quite happy, I believe. Jane will be treated well; it will be a pleasure. I cannot tell you her salary, but, Miss Woodhouse, it is quite high, and given to such a young girl like Jane."</p>

	<p>"And, when is Miss Fairfax to leave you?"</p>

	<p>"Very soon, very soon, indeed, which is terrible for us. Within two weeks she will leave us. Mrs Smallridge wants her to begin quickly. My poor mother is greatly upset."</p>

	<p>"Yes, her friends must be sorry to lose her, as well. Colonel and Mrs Campbell will be quite sorry to find out she has found employment before their return."</p>

	<p>"Yes, Jane says she is sure they will, but she believes she must take this position. I was astonished when she first told me!"</p>

	<p>As Miss Bates spoke, Emma did not realize she had been staring at Jane's beloved pianoforte.</p>

	<p>"Ah, I see you are thinking of the pianoforte. What will happen to that? Dear Jane was talking of it earlier. 'You must go,' she said. 'You and I must part. Let it stay, however, till Colonel Campbell returns.' Although, Miss Woodhouse, I do believe she still does not know whether it was his present or his daughter's."</p>

	<p>Emma remembered the pianoforte, and how terribly she had treated poor Jane Fairfax when she first arrived in Highbury.</p>
