	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER THIRTY-FIVE</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">E</span>linor's curiosity to see Mrs Ferrars was satisfied. She discovered, just as she had suspected, that Mrs Ferrars was a proud, angry old woman, and would have caused many problems for her and Edward, if they had, indeed, become engaged. That morning after Mrs Jennings went out for visits, Lucy came to see Elinor to show her satisfaction in Mrs Ferrars behavior towards herself during the dinner party the night before.</p>

	<p>Elinor was quite surprised that Lucy could be so pleased with Mrs Ferrars' attitude towards her, as Elinor believed it to be quite obvious that Mrs Ferrars giving Lucy and her sister such tender attention was only to hurt Elinor.</p>

	<p>"My dear friend," cried Lucy, "I came to talk of my happiness. I was so worried to see Mrs Ferrars, but she was so interested in talking with me. I knew she was quite fond of me. She was not kinder to anyone else than she was to me. She is such a charming woman, and so is your sister, Mrs John Dashwood. They are both delightful women indeed! You have never before told me how charming your sister is! Now, Edward and I will be able to meet often, for Lady Middleton was quite fond of Mrs Dashwood, so I believe we will all spend a great deal of time together. I am sure if you tell your sister, Mrs John Dashwood, that I think she is a charming woman, you will not speak too highly."</p>

	<p>But Elinor would not tell her sister-in-law what Lucy thought of her, as Lucy hoped she would.</p>

	<p>"Yes, Mrs Ferrars was quite delighted with me from the beginning of the night, and I know that when she does not dislike someone, her dislike is great."</p>

	<p>Elinor did not respond to this comment, intended to hurt her. At that moment, however, Mr Edward Ferrars came into the room.</p>

	<p>It was quite an awkward moment for the three, particularly since there was no one else in the room, which made them look rather foolish. Lucy had never told Edward she had informed Elinor of their engagement, and therefore, greeted him politely before sitting down, refusing to say a word. Since Edward did not know Elinor knew of his secret engagement, Lucy could not speak to him with tenderness, and could only look her tenderness.</p>

	<p>But Elinor had to do more. She would not let Lucy's presence force her to hide her joy in seeing Edward, and she greeted him with warmth and joy. After a few moments with him, she left to inform Marianne that Edward had arrived. She waited in the hall for a few minutes, so Edward and Lucy would have a short time to be together. When she told Marianne of Edward's arrival, she immediately went to him, eager to see him.</p>

	<p>"Dear Edward!" she cried, "this is a moment of great happiness!"</p>

	<p>During Edward's short visit, Marianne insisted that he return to Barton with them to visit Mrs Dashwood. Edward, of course, politely declined, which greatly satisfied Lucy, but Marianne was quite confused at his refusing her invitation. Soon enough, however, he left them. Soon after, Lucy left, as well.</p>

	<p>"What can bring her here so often?" asked Marianne, after she had left. "Could she not see that we wanted her gone? Poor Edward!" Elinor did not say anything, however, as she knew she could not tell her sister of Lucy's great secret.</p>
