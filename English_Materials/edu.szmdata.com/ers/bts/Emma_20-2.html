	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER TWENTY</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">J</span>ane Fairfax was the only child of Mrs Bates' youngest daughter. Her father died while serving in the military when she was a young child. Jane's mother was shocked when her husband died, and could not live without him. Soon after, when Jane was three years old, her mother died, as well. She was then sent to live with her grandmother, Mrs Bates. She received a limited education there, with little opportunity.</p>

	<p>Jane's father had saved a man's life while in the military. This man, Colonel Campbell, wanted to repay Lieutenant Fairfax for his help. At the age of nine, Jane went to live with the Campbell family. The Campbells' only child was a daughter, also nine years old. The Campbells regarded Jane as a daughter, offering her an excellent education.</p>

	<p>Jane was to study education, and then one day would look for work as a teacher. At the age of eighteen or nineteen, her education was complete, but the Campbells loved her too much to let her leave their home at that time. Her future as a teacher was delayed. She continued to live with the Campbells, enjoying high society, although she knew one day she would have to leave to earn a living.</p>

	<p>The family continued to live together until Miss Campbell married a young, wealthy man, named Mr Dixon. By this time, Jane was twenty-one years old. She had promised herself that at that age, she would leave the Campbells to make a living for herself, leaving high society. The Campbells were rather upset about her leaving, but they knew she had to begin working. Still, she had been ill since their daughter's marriage, so they agreed that Jane must first recover before leaving them.</p>

	<p>The Campbells, along with their daughter and her new husband, Mr Dixon, were leaving for Ireland, where the Dixons planned to live. Jane was asked to go along, but she decided to visit Mrs and Miss Bates instead, although she was greatly missed by the Campbells, particularly their daughter.</p>

	<p>Jane would be in Highbury for three months with her aunt. Emma was sorry to have to visit someone she did not like. Mr George Knightley believed Emma disliked her because Jane was a talented young woman, completing many things Emma has attempted, but never finished. Emma strongly disagreed with Mr Knightley, but at times, she could understand his reason. Emma felt Jane was cold and silent. Although, everyone in Highbury thought the two girls, Emma and Jane, would become great friends.</p>

	<p>Soon after Jane arrived in Highbury, Emma and Mr Knightley went for a visit. Jane had not visited in over two years, and when Emma saw her during this visit, she was surprised at Jane Fairfax's elegance. She was attractive, with a delicate face. Emma greatly admired elegance; therefore, she now admired the graceful Jane Fairfax. Emma decided that she no longer disliked Jane; she now felt kindness and respect for the girl. She was curious about Jane's reasons for not joining the Campbells in Ireland, since after this trip to Highbury, she would have to leave them to look for work. Emma believed Jane's reason was Mr Dixon; perhaps Jane envied Mrs Dixon. Emma asked about Mr Dixon, but Jane said little about the Dixons. Emma also inquired about Mr Frank Churchill, who Jane had met on a trip to Weymouth. Jane said little about this, as well.</p>

	<p>"Was he handsome?"</p>

	<p>"He was a fine young man."</p>

	<p>"Was he agreeable?"</p>

	<p>"He was thought so."</p>

	<p>Emma could not forgive her for her unwillingness to speak.</p>
