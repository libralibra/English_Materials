	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER NINE</p>

	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">A Continent Disappeared</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">T</span>he next morning, the 19th of February, I saw the Canadian enter my room. I expected his visit. He looked very disappointed.</p>

	<p>"Well, sir?" said he.</p>

	<p>"Well, Ned, yesterday we were unlucky," I told him. I then explained the discovery I made the previous night about the captain's great fortune.</p>

	<p>"Well, another time we must succeed. Perhaps tonight," answered the Canadian calmly.</p>

	<p>"In what direction are we going now?" I asked.</p>

	<p>"I do not know," replied Ned.</p>

	<p>I quickly dressed and went to the sitting room, where I could see our direction. We were heading southwest, away from Europe, perhaps were going to the southern point of Africa. I then went to the platform. Ned was already there. We could no longer see land. Now, we had no way to escape. I cannot explain the anger Ned Land felt at that moment.</p>

	<p>I, however, was not too sorry. I was able to continue my work, although I did feel great pity for my companion, the Canadian, who longed to be on land so dearly.</p>

	<p>That night at eleven o'clock, Captain Nemo came to see me, which rather surprised me.</p>

	<p>"Professor Aronnax," he said, "you have visited the depths of the ocean by daylight, but would you like to explore the ocean bottom in the darkness?"</p>

	<p>"Yes, I would."</p>

	<p>"I must tell you, the path is difficult, and we shall have to walk a long distance, and must climb a mountain."</p>

	<p>"I am ready to follow you, Captain," I responded, eager for this new journey.</p>

	<p>Near midnight, Captain Nemo and I were in our suits and helmets on the bottom of the ocean. The waters were dark, and we had not brought our electric lanterns, as the captain informed me they would be useless. He then pointed into the distance. Faraway, I saw a reddish spot shining brightly, though I did not know where it was coming from.</p>

	<p>As we walked, I heard a strange sound about our heads, and soon realized it was rain, showering above us, but we were nearly 150 fathoms below. The reddish light I had seen was becoming brighter as we continued our walk. I realized that the light was coming from a fire on the opposite side of an 800-foot high mountain under the water.</p>

	<p>Two hours after leaving the Nautilus, we had reached the top of that incredible mountain. We began to walk down the other side, and I saw in the valley below, an ancient city underwater. The reddish color was an explosion coming through the hole in the top of a mountain; such mountains are called volcanoes. This particular volcano was shooting out hot liquid through the top, but was still underwater, therefore no fire was seen.</p>

	<p>Where was I? I must find out. I must speak, but Captain Nemo then stopped me with a gesture, then picked up a piece of stone, and began writing one word in the sand&#151;ATLANTIS.</p>

	<p>There are many stories told about this city of Atlantis. Most have heard legends of this famous city, though no one knew if it truly existed. This ancient city was supposedly on an island near Greece, but fell into the ocean after a terrible explosion from a volcano on its island. And now, I had come to this incredible sight. We stood there for an hour looking at the incredible ancient city. After some time, however, we returned to the Nautilus, though I was still shocked at having seen that legendary place.</p>
