	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER TWENTY</p>

	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">The Church, Forests, and Freedom</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">A</span> religious man stood up. He said, "It's impossible to start the army we want without the church. We must give everything to the church and the priests. They are the only people that can speak to the common people. If every priest talks to the people, they will give us our army."</p>

	<p>The discussion was very active. Many people were angry, and they all talked openly. These people will poison me, Julien thought. How can they say these things in front of a peasant?</p>

	<p>The host stopped them. "We must decide," he said, "what letter Mr Sorel will take to our friend across the border."</p>

	<p>At three in the morning Julien and the marquis left. The marquis wrote out the letter. In the morning they went to a house far from Paris. The marquis was not worried about Julien's memory, but he feared Julien would be caught.</p>

	<p>Julien left for the next town. As soon as he was on the road he forgot about his mission. His mind was only on Mathilde. At a village, the post officer told him there was no carriage for the next town. Julien was angry, but he ordered some food. He did not trust the officer.</p>

	<p>He had a happy surprise, though. Sitting next to the fire with several Germans was his friend Geronimo, the opera singer. "Let's go outside," Geronimo said. When they were far away, he said, "Do you know what's going on? I gave a child some money and he told me there are many horses down the street. They want to delay some messenger."</p>

	<p>"Really?" Julien said innocently.</p>

	<p>"Let's wait until tomorrow. We'll order breakfast. While they make it we'll sneak out and hire some horses."</p>

	<p>Julien did not know if he could trust Geronimo, but there was nothing to do.</p>

	<p>He went to bed, but he woke up when he heard two people in his room. Julien touched his gun, which was under the pillow. The post officer was there with a man in priest's clothes. "He won't wake up," the post officer said. "We gave him some of the wine you prepared."</p>

	<p>"There are no letters here," the priest said. "The other one is probably the messenger. I think his Italian accent is fake."</p>

	<p>The priest turned around. It was Father Castan&#xE8;de from the school! Julien badly wanted to kill the evil man, but it would ruin his mission. He waited fifteen minutes, and then he yelled, "Help! I've been poisoned! I'm in so much pain!"</p>

	<p>He then went to check on Geronimo. Geronimo was almost dead from the poison, and Julien couldn't wake him up. He had to leave alone.</p>

	<p>Julien reached the duke's home without more trouble. When he found the duke, they went to a low class coffee house. In a small room Julien told the duke everything, and the duke wrote it all down. "Wait one half hour, and then go to Strassburg," the duke commanded. "Wait there for two weeks, and then return. Silence!"</p>

	<p>Julien admired the man. That's the way to do business! It took two days to get to Strassburg. Father Castan&#xE8;de works for the Congregation, Julien thought. If he had recognized me, I'd be dead.</p>
