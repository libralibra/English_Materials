	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER TWENTY</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">O</span>ne day, when Edna was feeling quite unhappy, she decided to pay Ms Reisz a visit. Even though their last meeting was not a very pleasant one, she still wished to hear the woman play the piano. However, when she went to get the woman's card, she found that it was missing. She then decided to try and find Ms Reisz's address in the city directory, but when she went to the home, she discovered that the woman had moved six months before. Edna asked the store owner next door if he knew Ms Reisz's new address. He, however, knew nothing and could only talk about how happy he was that the woman was no longer in the neighborhood.</p>

	<p>Then Edna realized that the best person to get the address from would be Madame Lebrun. It was November, so she knew that the Lebruns would have returned to New Orleans. She knew the address and went there immediately. Victor answered the door and happily greeted her. He was surprised to see her and made no attempt to hide it. Apparently, his relationship with the servants was not a very good one, for when he told the black woman behind him to inform his mother that she had a guest, the servant refused to go. He then shouted many terrible words at the woman and scared her into doing what she was told.</p>

	<p>Edna then sat down on the front porch. It was a nice day outside, and because she was tired she wanted to sit and relax in the sunlight for a while. Victor sat down in a chair next to hers and explained that he was only in town for a couple of days. Usually, he spent the winters at Grand Isle, taking care of the house, getting things ready for the next summer.</p>

	<p>"I come to the city to give myself a break. Whew! You wouldn't believe the night I had! What a time!"</p>

	<p>He then spent the next few minutes telling Mrs Pontellier about a girl he had met. It was obvious that he had been successful with her. He probably would have described their whole night together in great detail, but soon, Madame Lebrun came out and joined them on the porch.</p>

	<p>"Why, Mrs Pontellier, what a wonderful surprise! Please, come inside. How's your family? You should visit us more often!" she said in her usual friendly way.</p>

	<p>Instead of going inside, they all stayed on the porch. Victor moved to a couch and laid down on it where he could easily look at Edna's face.</p>

	<p>"We've hardly heard from our Robert," Madame Lebrun went on, "He's only written us twice. Victor, could you get those letters for me?"</p>

	<p>"Why? They're very uninteresting. I can tell you everything he wrote in them now!" he answered.</p>

	<p>Victor was right. The letters said almost nothing. He talked a little about Mexico City and the city of Vera Cruz. It seemed that there would be plenty of opportunities for him to make money there, but nothing had happened yet. He sent some money to Madame Lebrun and asked that she say "hello" to all of his friends. And that was all.</p>

	<p>Edna's sadness suddenly came back to her and she remembered her desire to see Ms Reisz. Madame Lebrun, of course, knew the address and gave it to Edna, but hoped that she might stay and join them for dinner, since it was already so late in the afternoon. Edna kindly refused the invitation and then got up to go. Victor walked with her out to the sidewalk and reminded her not to share with anyone else the story of his adventures the other night. She made a joke of it and laughed.</p>

	<p>Later, when Victor returned to the porch, Madame Lebrun commented on how good Mrs Pontellier looked.</p>

	<p>"Yes, she looks incredible!" he answered, "She's almost like a different woman!"</p>
