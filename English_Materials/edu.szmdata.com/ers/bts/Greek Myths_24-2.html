	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">The Argo and the Argonauts</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">T</span>he day after his conversation with Pelias, Jason began his preparations. The Golden Fleece was owned by King Aeetes, ruler of the land of Colchis. The journey to Colchis would take many months by ship and Jason knew that only the best of ships would make it safely. Jason hired Argus, the most famous ship builder, and asked him to make the greatest ship of all time. Argus used all of his skill and made a ship that was both fast and strong. Then Hera, who wished to help Jason on his quest, visited Argus and gave him a magical figurehead to hang on the front of the ship. The figurehead could see the direction of the waves and wind and would warn Jason of storms and other dangers. Argus was so proud of his ship that he gave it his own name and called it the "Argo."</p>

	<p>Jason then searched for companions to help him in his dangerous task. To accomplish this, he sent messengers to find strong men interested in adventure. From all around Greece, many heroes learned of Jason's journey for the fleece and came to join him. These men were called the Argonauts, since they would all sail on the Argo. Among them were Zetes and Calais, who were sons of the North Wind and able to fly; Tiphys, the world's greatest ship sailor; Hercules, the world's strongest man; Hercules' good friend Hylas; and even the great musician Orpheus. They all joined Jason in his great adventure.</p>

	<p>Within a month, all of the preparations were made. Jason said goodbye to his uncle and promised to return soon with the fleece. The Argonauts each began their work on the ship and Orpheus played sweet music to cheer them. They sailed for a week before coming to a small island, where they stopped to gather more food and fresh water.</p>

	<p>Once the Argonauts were on land they were quickly surrounded by an army of women. Without knowing it, they had landed on the island of Lemnos&#151;an island where the women had joined together and killed all the men. The queen of Lemnos was called Hypsipyle, and she was both beautiful and strong. Hypsipyle felt that men were troublesome and should all be killed, but she changed her mind when she saw how strong and handsome Jason was.</p>

	<p>Hypsipyle invited Jason and all the Argonauts to stay on Lemnos. They rested there for more than a month. They spent their days eating great meals and drinking wine. At night, the women would pay great attention to each of them. Jason was so happy lying in Hypsipyle's arms that he never wanted to leave, but finally Hercules convinced him that they should continue their journey.</p>
