	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER THIRTY-FIVE</p>

	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">Phineas Fogg Does Not Have to Repeat His Orders to Passepartout Twice</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">T</span>he people that lived in Saville Row did not know Phineas Fogg had returned home. His doors and windows were all still closed.</p>

	<p>He remained calm. Ruined! And because of the detective's mistake! After such a long journey he failed at the end. Only a few pounds were left of the money he brought with him. All he had left were the twenty thousand pounds in the bank, and he owed this to his friends of the Reform Club. The tour was so expensive. Even if he would have won, he would not have made much money. Since he lost, he was ruined.</p>

	<p>A room in the house was set aside for Aouda. She was very sad for her protector.</p>

	<p>Passepartout knew that sometimes Englishmen tried to kill themselves after so great a failure, so he watched his master carefully.</p>

	<p>But first of all, he went to his room and turned off the gas burner.</p>

	<p>The night passed. Mr Fogg went to bed, but did he sleep? Aouda did not close her eyes. Passepartout watched his master's door all night, like a faithful dog.</p>

	<p>Passepartout blamed himself for his master's failure. Finally, Passepartout could not hold it in.</p>

	<p>"My master! Mr Fogg!" he cried, "Why don't you shout at me? It's my fault&#151;"</p>

	<p>"I blame no one," replied Phineas Fogg.</p>

	<p>On this day (Sunday), Phineas Fogg did not go to the Reform Club at half past eleven. Why should he go? His friends no longer expected him there. Since Phineas Fogg had not arrived the evening before (Saturday, the 21st of December, at a quarter before nine), he had lost his wager.</p>

	<p>He remained at home. He shut himself up in his room, and began settling his business. The hours were long for Passepartout. He was no longer angry at Fix. Fix had made a mistake, but he had done his duty, while Passepartout&#160;... This thought made Passepartout sick.</p>

	<p>At half past seven Mr Fogg visited Aouda. He sat down near the fireplace. He sat several minutes without speaking. Then he said, "Madam, will you forgive me for bringing you to England?"</p>

	<p>"I, Mr Fogg!" replied Aouda.</p>

	<p>"Please let me finish. When I decided to bring you far away from your country, I was rich. I was going to give you some part of my money. You would be free and happy. But now I am ruined."</p>

	<p>"I know it, Mr Fogg," replied Aouda, "and I ask you, will you forgive me? Maybe I caused some delay."</p>

	<p>"I could not leave you in India&#151;it was not safe."</p>

	<p>"So, Mr Fogg," continued Aouda, "you rescued me from death and you still wanted to do more?"</p>

	<p>"Yes, but now I cannot."</p>

	<p>"What will become of you?"</p>

	<p>"I have need of nothing," replied the gentleman.</p>

	<p>"At least your friends&#151;"</p>

	<p>"I have no friends, madam."</p>

	<p>"Your relatives&#151;"</p>

	<p>"I have no relatives."</p>

	<p>"I pity you, Mr Fogg. You should not be alone." She rose and took his hand. "Do you wish to have a woman and a friend? Will you have me as your wife?"</p>

	<p>Mr Fogg rose. There was light in his eyes, and his lips moved slightly. He shut his eyes. When he opened them again, he said, "I love you! Yes, I love you, and I am entirely yours!"</p>

	<p>Passepartout was called. Mr Fogg still held Aouda's hand. Passepartout understood, and his face became as bright as the sun.</p>

	<p>Mr Fogg asked him if it was too late to call the Reverend Samuel Wilson that evening.</p>

	<p>Passepartout smiled and said, "Never too late."</p>

	<p>It was five minutes past eight.</p>

	<p>"Will it be for tomorrow, Monday?"</p>

	<p>"For tomorrow, Monday," said Mr Fogg, turning to Aouda.</p>

	<p>"Yes, for tomorrow, Monday," she replied.</p>

	<p>Passepartout ran as fast as his legs could carry him.</p>
