	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER SIX</p>

	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">Captain Nemo's Fortune</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">T</span>he next day, the 12th of February, the Nautilus went to the surface. I went to the platform early in the morning. Ned and Conseil joined me at seven o'clock.</p>

	<p>"Well, Professor," Ned said cheerfully, "can you tell me where we are now?"</p>

	<p>"We are floating on the surface of the Mediterranean, friend Ned. Look, there is the Egyptian coast," I told him eagerly.</p>

	<p>"Certainly you are right, sir," he said after looking at the coast for a few moments. "Now, let us talk of another affair, but we must not let others hear us," Ned continued.</p>

	<p>I knew Ned Land wished to speak about our plans for escaping that submarine.</p>

	<p>"Well, what would you like to tell us?" I asked as we three sat down together.</p>

	<p>"Well, we are now in Europe, and before we are taken to some unknown land, we should attempt to escape from the Nautilus immediately."</p>

	<p>I did not feel any desire to leave the captain, but I also realized that my companions were rather anxious to leave the Nautilus to continue their lives, particularly Ned Land. Thanks to the captain and his invention, I was adding a great deal to my ocean studies, and re-writing my book of the ocean depths. Would I ever have another opportunity like this? No, certainly not!</p>

	<p>"Friend Ned, please tell me honestly, are you tired of being onboard? Do you regret finding the Nautilus?"</p>

	<p>After a few moments of silence, the Canadian responded, "I do not regret this journey under the seas, but I will be glad to be finished with it."</p>

	<p>"It will end, Ned."</p>

	<p>"Where and when?"</p>

	<p>"I do not know when and where. Perhaps in six months our trip will be over, having gone through all the seas of the earth."</p>

	<p>"Well, sir, can you tell me where we will be in six months," the Canadian asked, looking bothered.</p>

	<p>"Perhaps China, you know how quickly the Nautilus sails through the water."</p>

	<p>"Professor Aronnax," replied the Canadian, "your arguments are terrible. You do not know where we will be in six months. We are here, and we must take our opportunity."</p>

	<p>I could not say anything. I understood his reasons, and had no argument left.</p>

	<p>"Sir," continued Ned, "if the captain decided today to allow you to leave the Nautilus, would you leave?"</p>

	<p>"I do not know," I answered.</p>

	<p>"And if he gave you this choice today, and would never again allow you such a choice, would you accept?" Ned continued.</p>

	<p>"Friend Ned, we know that the captain would never allow us such opportunities. We must wait for the first opportunity to escape from the Nautilus," I responded.</p>

	<p>"That is a wise decision, Professor Aronnax!"</p>

	<p>"But we must escape on our first attempt because if we fail, we shall never have another opportunity at escaping, and the captain will never forgive us."</p>

	<p>"Yes, this is true," replied the Canadian. "But, if we do find the opportunity, whether in two days or two years, we must take it."</p>

	<p>"Agreed!"</p>

	<p>"Yes, we must wait for the Nautilus to sail near the coast, then we can escape with the submarine's boat."</p>

	<p>"I must tell you that I believe this will never happen, as the captain is careful never to sail near the coasts. He must also understand that we may attempt to escape."</p>

	<p>"We shall see," said Ned Land, refusing to believe me.</p>

	<p>"And now, Ned Land," I said, "we must stop here. The day you are ready to leave, tell us, and we will follow you."</p>

	<p>In the days following this conversation, the Nautilus was usually underwater and far from the European coast. Did Captain Nemo distrust us in these seas? Or did he wish to hide his invention from the many ships going through those waters?</p>

	<p>One evening, I was writing in the sitting room when I looked out the thick glass windows to see a man in the water.</p>

	<p>"A man has lost his boat! He must be saved!" I told the captain.</p>

	<p>The captain said nothing, but looked at the man for a few moments.</p>

	<p>"Do not worry," said Captain Nemo. "It is Nicholas. He is well known in these islands for being an excellent diver. He lives more in the water than out of it."</p>

	<p>"You know him, Captain?"</p>

	<p>"Why not, Professor Aronnax?"</p>

	<p>After saying this, he went to a chest filled with gold. He counted the pieces carefully before replacing the gold in the chest. I estimated the gold to be worth nearly 200,000 English pounds. He called two of his men to come fetch the chest. We then returned to the surface of the water where I heard the heavy chest being loaded on to the boat. After a short time, the boat returned to the Nautilus and again sunk under the surface of the water.</p>

	<p>That night, I could not sleep. I knew there was a connection to the mysterious swimmer and the chest of gold. Where were these riches going? Who was communicating with Captain Nemo on land?</p>

	<p>The next day, I told this story to Conseil and Ned. My companions were as surprised as I was.</p>

	<p>"But where does he take that fortune?" asked Ned Land.</p>

	<p>None of us knew.</p>
