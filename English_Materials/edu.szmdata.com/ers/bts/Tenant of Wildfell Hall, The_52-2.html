	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER FIFTY-TWO</p>

	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">Uncertainty</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">A</span>s I was leaving Grassdale Manor, the driver began speaking to me. He had previously worked at the Hargraves home.</p>

	<p>"Is Mr Hargrave married, then?"</p>

	<p>"Yes sir, a month ago. He was married to a rich older woman, whose first husband had died. She and Mr Hargrave argued about how much he would receive, after their wedding. She refused to give him all her money, as he wanted. So, he soon left her. A few months ago, he married a plain older woman, with less money. She was pleased to be getting married, but has discovered that he is not the gentleman she thought he was. He isn't so nice, generous, or friendly."</p>

	<p>I became quite anxious when I first saw Grassdale Manor. I could not deny that Helen's wealth was far above my own. Would she still be in love with me? Could she, indeed, marry me, although she is much wealthier than I am?</p>

	<p>I slowly walked to the door, and asked for Mrs Huntingdon, but was soon informed that she was staying at Staningley with her aunt, but would return before Christmas. I decided that I must see her, to find out if my dear Helen still loved me, as I loved her.</p>

	<p>Many hours later, I arrived at Staningley, worried and anxious. I stood in front of the gates for some time, deciding whether to walk to the house, or leave immediately. No, I could not let her see me. How could such a woman of wealth and luxury marry me? No&#151;I would not ask her! I would leave immediately, and she will never know that I had come.</p>

	<p>"Goodbye then, dear Helen, forever!"</p>
