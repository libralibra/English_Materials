	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER EIGHT</p>

	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">Queen Marguerite</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">T</span>he next day at dinner, Mathilde was wearing all black clothes. Did a relative die? Julien wondered. When they were alone, he asked the professor. "You don't know?" the professor said. He was happy to be able to teach Julien.</p>

	<p>Mathilde admired one of her ancestors, Boniface de la Mole. This man was the lover of Queen Marguerite de Navarre, and once he had tried to rescue some friends from the king's prison. His partner ran away, and Boniface de la Mole was put to death. The queen was so upset she sent her servant to get Boniface de la Mole's head. She secretly went late at night to Montmartre, the highest hill in Paris, and buried the head herself. Since Mathilde was a child she loved the story.</p>

	<p>Julien was impressed. So many people were dishonest in Paris, but this woman was true.</p>

	<p>The two began to talk more often. Julien was impressed by her knowledge, and he began to talk openly. He forgot about his role as a revolutionary.</p>

	<p>One day Julien was thinking about the benefits of being a noble. Nobles don't have to worry about making money, but Julien had very little of his own. Mathilde saw him and asked what he was thinking. His pride was strong and he told her the truth. She thought he was very attractive at that moment.</p>

	<p>A month later she took his arm and walked in the garden. She said she hurt her foot, but Julien did not know if that was true. Does she like me? He thought. She never looks at other people like she looks at me.</p>

	<p>It would be funny if she loved me! He thought. He knew Marquis de la Mole wanted her to marry Marquis de Croisenois. She is beautiful, though, Julien thought. When she looks at me with those big blue eyes, I can't think of anything else.</p>

	<p>Julien decided right then. I will have her, he thought, and no one will stop me.</p>
