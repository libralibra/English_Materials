	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER SIXTEEN</p>

	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">Dr Seward's Diary</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">30</span> September&#151;Upon coming back home today, I found Arthur and Quincey had arrived and already read the papers the Harkers had put together. Mina then surprised me with a request to talk with patient Renfield. I decided to allow this and took her down to his room. Being careful not to let her get too close to him, I stood in between the patient and his visitor, in case he got any sudden violent ideas.</p>

	<p>"Are you the woman Dr Seward wished to make his wife?" he asked Mina, "Silly me! That's impossible, for she is dead."</p>

	<p>"I'm just a friend," she answered.</p>

	<p>"How did you know&#160;...&#160;?" I began to ask him, but he interrupted me.</p>

	<p>"Shut up! I'm not talking to you!" he shouted. Then turning his face back toward Mina, he spoke, more softly, "We all love the doctor very much. He allows me to continue my experiments with insects, which I appreciate very much. You see. I believe that by eating living things, I can live longer. Just ask the doctor. One time, I even tried to eat him!"</p>

	<p>Mina remained very calm and friendly. I, however, decided to end their little conversation before it could get too uncomfortable for her. Besides, Van Helsing was due to arrive very soon.</p>

	<p>"Miss," said Renfield as we were leaving his room, "You're kind, but I hope we never meet again."</p>

	<p class="zeroIndentBoldFace">Mina Harker's Journal</p>

	<p>30 September&#151;We all met in Dr Seward's office, this evening; myself, Jonathan, Van Helsing, Dr Seward, Arthur Godalming, and Quincey Morris.</p>

	<p>"I assume that everyone here has read the papers put together by these two fine people, Jonathan and Mina Harker. Good! Then let me begin by telling you what I now know about the Count. He is an old vampire, and, therefore, very strong and very wise. He has many special powers. He can control the weather, and the minds of other people. He can also control animals. He can change himself into different types of animals: a dog, a bat, a wolf, and so on. In trying to destroy him, we are in danger of becoming like him: one of the Un-dead. Yet, we must try our best. We cannot let him continue to spread his evil."</p>

	<p>"He is powerful; however, we are powerful, as well," he continued, "In some ways, we have more freedom than he does. We can live in both day and night. We have scientific knowledge. And we have our love for each other."</p>

	<p>"Now, something you should know: these vampires do not die as we do. They can live as long as they have blood to drink. They can even become younger, as our friend, Jonathan, noticed recently. He can also see very well in darkness. However, he has his weaknesses too. He hates garlic, and cannot go near religious objects, such as the cross. He can be killed by shooting him with a blessed bullet; by running a wooden stake through his heart; or by removing his head with a knife."</p>

	<p>"Mina, dear. I'm happy to say that your work is done. You have been extremely helpful. However, now the danger begins and I want you as far from it as possible."</p>

	<p>I hated to hear this, but I could see that everyone felt the same way. I had no choice but to agree. They decided to go that night to the Count's home to have a look around, while I was simply to go to bed. I wish them much luck!</p>

	<p class="zeroIndentBoldFace">Dr Seward's Diary</p>

	<p>1 October, 4 am&#151;As we were about to leave for the house next door, one of my men came to me to say that patient Renfield strongly wished to speak with me. Van Helsing and the others were interested in meeting him, so I agreed to see the patient.</p>

	<p>He greeted each of us, one by one, like a true gentleman. I was completely shocked by his manner and politeness. He showed an intelligence and familiarity with upper society that I had never once guessed he had. Then he came to the point of his request to see me. He wished to be released at that very moment.</p>

	<p>"As you can see. I'm quite normal now. It's very important that you let me go."</p>

	<p>Knowing how quickly his behavior could change, I, of course, refused. He surprised me again by remaining calm.</p>

	<p>"You don't understand. I must go. If I remain here, I will be in great danger. You must let me go."</p>

	<p>"I will talk with you more in the morning," I replied, "Then we will see what I can do."</p>

	<p>"Please! I'm begging you, all of you! Let me go free!"</p>

	<p>"Absolutely not!" I said strongly.</p>

	<p>Renfield suddenly became quiet and sat on his bed. As we were leaving his room, he addressed me one more time, "Doctor. Do me a favor. Tomorrow, when everything's different, think about what I said to you tonight."</p>
