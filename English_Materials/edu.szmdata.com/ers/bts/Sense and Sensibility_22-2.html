	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">D</span>uring Lucy and Anne's stay with the Middletons, Elinor was the Dashwood sister responsible for showing friendly, proper behavior towards the guests. Lucy, in particular, showed great interest in talking with Elinor, and made conversation with her whenever possible. Elinor discovered that Lucy was, indeed, a rather amusing and clever girl, but realized that she knew nothing of books, art, and poetry, and rather pitied poor Lucy for it. One morning, the two girls were taking a walk together when Lucy admitted a great secret to Elinor, which she was not too willing to hear.</p>

	<p>"Please allow me to ask you a rather odd question," said Lucy, "but do you know Mrs Ferrars quite well?"</p>

	<p>"No, I know nothing of her," Elinor replied after a moment's silence.</p>

	<p>"I am sorry to be so impolite in asking such a question, but I feel that I can trust you. Therefore, I must ask for some advice from you on how to manage the uncomfortable situation I am in. I am sorry you do not know Mrs Ferrars."</p>

	<p>"I am sorry I do not," said Elinor in great astonishment, "if it could help you to know my opinion of her," Elinor said, quite annoyed at Lucy's impolite questions. "I never did understand how your two families were connected, anyway. Therefore, I am a little surprised you are asking me about Mrs Ferrars."</p>

	<p>"I will tell you, indeed. I do not well know her now, but I hope very soon to be closely connected with her," she said with a smile.</p>

	<p>"Oh my!" cried Elinor, "what do you mean? Do you know Mr Robert Ferrars well?" Elinor responded, rather bothered thinking that the two might one day be sisters-in-law.</p>

	<p>"No, not Mr Robert Ferrars, I have never seen him," she said, looking carefully at Elinor, "but his older brother."</p>

	<p>Elinor looked at Lucy in complete astonishment, unable to say a word.</p>

	<p>"Yes, you may be surprised," continued Lucy, "as we have been engaged in secret. No one has known except my sister, Anne, and ourselves. I have no fear that you can keep this secret, as I know you are quite a trustworthy young woman." After a moment's pause, Lucy continued to explain, "We have been engaged for four years."</p>

	<p>"Four years!"</p>

	<p>"Yes. I did not know that you even knew him until the other day when Sir John mentioned your family knows him. I have known him for several years. He was schooled at my uncle's home for quite some time."</p>

	<p>"Your uncle!"</p>

	<p>"Yes, Mr Pratt. Did you ever hear Edward speak of Mr Pratt?"</p>

	<p>"I think I have," replied Elinor, trying to hide her pain and disappointment.</p>

	<p>"He lived with my uncle for four years, near Plymouth. We met there, as my sister and I often stay with my uncle. I was quite unwilling to agree to marry him without first meeting his mother, but I was foolish and in love with him. You know as well as I do how easy it is to fall in love with him."</p>

	<p>"It is strange," said Elinor after a short silence, "that he has never mentioned your name to me."</p>

	<p>"No, it is not strange," Lucy replied confidently, "our engagement is a secret, therefore he must never speak of me to anyone. Miss Dashwood, what would you do if you were in my position?"</p>

	<p>"Pardon," replied Elinor, shocked by the question. "I certainly cannot give you any advice, you must decide for yourself."</p>

	<p>"Poor Edward," continued Lucy, "his mother is so controlling of him. We never are able to see each other more than once or twice a year. Did he seem quite upset when he came to visit you at Barton? He was so sad when he left us in Plymouth to go to you. I was afraid you would think he was ill."</p>

	<p>"Did he come from your uncle's when he visited us?"</p>

	<p>"Yes, he had been staying with us for two weeks, and he was so disturbed to have to leave."</p>

	<p>After a long silence, Lucy took out a letter she had with her. "Writing to each other is the only comfort we have in such long separations." she said, as she handed the letter to Elinor.</p>

	<p>Elinor was shocked to see that Edward had written the letter, but continued to hide her emotions from the impolite young Lucy.</p>

	<p>"Perhaps you noticed the ring of hair around his finger?" Lucy asked.</p>

	<p>"I did," Elinor said, without looking at Lucy, who was smiling with satisfaction.</p>

	<p>At that moment, they reached the cottage, and their conversation ended.</p>
