Emma realized that Harriet could see Mr Elton's true character, and she was no longer in love with him. Late in the night, Harriet and Frank Churchill arrived at the Woodhouses arm in arm. Harriet looked frightened, and he was trying to calm her. Emma was soon told the story of Harriet's awful walk home from the dance.</p>
