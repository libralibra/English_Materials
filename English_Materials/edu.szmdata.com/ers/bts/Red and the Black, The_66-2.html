	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER THIRTY-SIX</p>

	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">The Trial</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">A</span>t last the day of the trial came. Fouqu&#xE9; was shocked; the whole province had come to Besan&#xE7;on to see the romantic trial.</p>

	<p>"We will win this trial," Vicar-general de Frilair said to Mathilde. "I can count on half of the jury to vote how I wish. Mr Valenod owes everything to me, and I told the others to vote with him."</p>

	<p>"What kind of man is Mr Valenod?" Mathilde asked.</p>

	<p>"He was born to be a leader of fools. He will fight the others until they agree."</p>

	<p>Julien did not want to speak at the trial. "These people from the provinces want to see me killed."</p>

	<p>"My sacrifices have inspired them," Mathilde said. "One word from you and the public will support you."</p>

	<p>When he entered the courtroom, Julien saw many women in the audience. One was Mrs Derville. Oh no! He thought. She'll tell Mrs de R&#x00EA;nal.</p>

	<p>The prosecutor talked for a long time. Julien looked to the jury and saw Mr Valenod staring at him. He'll be happy to see me killed, Julien thought.</p>

	<p>Julien had decided not to speak, but at the end he changed his mind. "I am not asking you for mercy," he said. "I tried to murder a great woman. I deserve to die for that."</p>

	<p>"But that is not my only crime. To you I am a rebellious peasant. You want to punish me because I tried to make myself better. I was educated, and I joined society. For that I will be punished, because none of you are like me. You are all rich men, and you were never poor."</p>

	<p>Julien talked like this for twenty minutes. All the women were weeping, even Mrs Derville.</p>

	<p>It was not until two o'clock in the morning that the jury made their decision. Mr Valenod walked in slowly and read the decision: Julien was guilty. The sentence was death.</p>

	<p>What a victory for Mr Valenod, thought Julien. He has won, and now I'll never see Mrs de R&#x00EA;nal again.</p>
