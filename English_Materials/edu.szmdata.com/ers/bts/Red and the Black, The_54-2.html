	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR</p>

	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">Manon Lescaut</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">P</span>rince Korasov's instructions said never to oppose what the woman says. One night at the opera, Julien praised the ballet based on the novel <i>Manon Lescaut</i>.</p>

	<p>Mrs de Fervaques said that the novel was better. This surprised Julien; a woman like Mrs de Fervaques would not read a novel! "All novels are bad, of course, but I've heard this one is better than most," she said. "It did not stop your Napoleon from saying it's a novel for servants, though."</p>

	<p>Julien became nervous. Someone's trying to ruin me, he thought. Someone told her that I admire Napoleon.</p>

	<p>When they left the opera, Mrs de Fervaques said, "Remember, sir, that you cannot have devotion to Napoleon and devotion to me."</p>

	<p>Devotion to me! Julien thought. Either this means nothing, or it means everything.</p>

	<p>Julien wrote the marquis' letters, and learned that Mathilde might marry Marquis de Croisenois. Julien was so sad that he once thought of killing himself. The next day he saw Mathilde's beautiful eyes, though, and he decided to follow Prince Korasov's plan until the end.</p>
