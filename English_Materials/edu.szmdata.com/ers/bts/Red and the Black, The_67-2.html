	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">Reluctant to Be Apart</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">J</span>ulien was woken up by the feeling of tears on his hand. It's Mathilde again, he thought. He opened his eyes to see Mrs de R&#x00EA;nal weeping. "Is it true? I'm seeing you before I die?" he said. "Oh, but I'm just a murderer to you."</p>

	<p>Mrs de R&#x00EA;nal said, "Please sign the appeal."</p>

	<p>"Forgive me!"</p>

	<p>"If you want me to forgive you, please sign the appeal."</p>

	<p>He kissed her all over. "Will you come see me every day?" he asked.</p>

	<p>"I swear I will, unless my husband forbids me."</p>

	<p>"Then I'll sign the appeal!" he cried.</p>

	<p>After a while they could talk again. Mrs de R&#x00EA;nal told Julien that her priest had forced her to write the letter to Marquis de la Mole. "What about Ms de la Mole?" she asked. "I've heard about this strange romance."</p>

	<p>"It's only true on the surface," he replied. "She is my wife, but she isn't my love."</p>

	<p>"I feel for you what I should feel for God," she said. "I don't think I will live long after you die."</p>

	<p>Julien stood up, and said, "I will not sign the appeal unless you promise me that you will not take your life! You must live. You must take care of my son; Mathilde will leave him with servants."</p>

	<p>"I swear I will not take my life."</p>
