	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER FOURTEEN</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">T</span>hat night, Catherine slept with me. Sometimes when I opened my eyes she would be gone. But after a while, she would return with a little food and we would drink some of my wine together.</p>

	<p>When I woke up in the morning she was gone again. Eventually, however, she came back and announced that the time had come for her to prepare me for the operation.</p>

	<p>"I've arranged it so that I will be getting you ready this morning. I just hate having the other nurses care for you. I must warn you, though. This won't be fun."</p>

	<p>"I'm glad you are doing it."</p>

	<p>"Now, be sure that you don't think about me when they give you the medication to sleep. You might mention me during the operation."</p>

	<p>"Don't worry. I won't."</p>

	<p>"You are such a good boy. I hope they don't send me away from you soon. This hospital has too many nurses and too few patients. I fear that they may ask some of us to leave."</p>

	<p>"I'm sure they won't. More patients will come. You'll see. Let's sleep together again tonight."</p>

	<p>"I don't think you'll really want that. You'll be too ill from the operation to want anything."</p>

	<p>"We'll see about that. I'll always want you."</p>

	<p>"Be honest with me. Have you loved many other women?"</p>

	<p>"Only you!"</p>

	<p>"Really?"</p>

	<p>"It's true. I promise you, or my leg will never be well again!"</p>

	<p>She laughed and said: "OK, then, how many women have you ever had&#160;... I mean, have you ever slept with!"</p>

	<p>"Only you!"</p>

	<p>"You are such a liar!"</p>

	<p>She was right, but I had to say: "I'm not lying, you are the first woman I've ever slept with! I promise!"</p>

	<p>"I know you are not telling the truth, but I'll pretend it's the truth. Do you really love me? If I do whatever you want, will you love me forever, and not love any other women anymore?"</p>

	<p>"Yes. Why don't you begin by coming over to me now?" I held her tightly, and kissed her. "I love you, Catherine. You are so nice!"</p>
