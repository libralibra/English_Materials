	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER FORTY-THREE</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">T</span>he next morning was filled with excitement for the adventure to Box Hill. Everyone admired the surroundings when they first arrived, but later in the day, they separated into parties. The Eltons walked together; Mr Knightley with Miss Bates and Jane; and Emma and Harriet with Frank Churchill. Mr Weston, however, tried to bring the party together again, although all his attempts failed.</p>

	<p>During the dinner, Frank Churchill paid close attention to Emma, amusing her, and flattering her. Emma, however, laughed because she was disappointed, although she did like Mr Churchill. She thought he should pay closer attention to her friend, Harriet, not herself.</p>

	<p>"Emma, thank you for telling me to come today! If you had not encouraged me to come, I would not be experiencing the happiness of this party. Yesterday, I had no plans of joining you today, but I am grateful to you for insisting that I come," Frank told her.</p>

	<p>After a short pause, he continued, "I have noticed our companions are silent. We must make them talk. They shall talk. Ladies and gentleman, Miss Woodhouse has just told me that she desires to know what you are all thinking of," announced Mr Churchill.</p>

	<p>Some laughed, and answered with humour. Miss Bates said quite a bit, as usual; Mrs Elton was upset that Miss Woodhouse was receiving attention, while she was not, and Mr George Knightley's response was the most direct.</p>

	<p>"Is Miss Woodhouse sure that she would like to hear what we are all thinking of?" he asked.</p>

	<p>"Oh no, no!" cried Emma, laughing, "But there are one or two perhaps" (glancing at Mr Weston and Harriet), "whose thoughts I would like to hear."</p>

	<p>"Well," cried Mrs Elton, "I should give my opinion, I am the leader of this party to Box Hill, I organized the outing, so perhaps I should speak," she continued for some time, although her husband was the only listener.</p>

	<p>Soon enough, Frank Churchill interrupted, "Ladies and gentlemen, Miss Woodhouse has declared that each one of you must entertain our party with a poem or a riddle."</p>

	<p>"Very well," exclaimed Miss Bates, "Three things very dull indeed. I say three things dull whenever I open my mouth," she smiled.</p>

	<p>"Pardon me, ma'am, but you are limited to only three, nothing more," Emma warned her with a smile.</p>

	<p>Miss Bates understood the meaning soon after and looked embarrassed. Mr Weston soon had a riddle for Emma.</p>

	<p>"What two letters of the alphabet go perfectly well together?" he paused, "Ah! You will never guess. I will tell you. <i>M</i> and <i>A</i>, Emma, do you understand?" (<i>EmMa</i> Woodhouse and <i>FrAnk</i> Churchill.)</p>

	<p>Emma quickly understood, and was quite amused, as were Frank and Harriet. Mr Knightley seemed to understand the riddle, but did not look amused. The rest of the party, however, did not understand the riddle.</p>

	<p>"I understand now what 'clever things' Miss Woodhouse wanted to hear, and Mr Weston's riddle was outstanding, but perfection should not come so quickly," he said seriously.</p>

	<p>Mrs Elton soon began to speak, "I really cannot attempt a riddle. I am not fond of them; I do not pretend to be clever. I have several other excellent qualities, but I know when to speak and when not to. Please, Mr E., Knightley, Jane, and myself, we have nothing clever to say, not one of us," she said firmly.</p>

	<p>"Yes, yes, I have nothing to say to entertain Miss Woodhouse. I am just an old married man," he said with a laugh, "Shall we walk, Augusta?"</p>

	<p>"Yes, but, Jane, please come hold my arm to walk with us, I am so tired after walking all day," Mrs Elton responded.</p>

	<p>Jane declined, and the husband and wife walked off. "Happy couple!" said Frank Churchill, as soon as they left. "They only knew each other a few weeks before they married, but a perfect pair they are."</p>

	<p>Jane, who seldom spoke, began, "Although it sometimes happens that couples come together quickly and thus have problems, their relationship can improve with time, if both are patient."</p>

	<p>Frank Churchill did not answer, but looked crushed.</p>

	<p>Soon afterwards, he said in an excited voice:</p>

	<p>"I cannot trust my own judgment in whom to marry. I hope somebody will choose my wife for me. Will you?" he asked, looking at Emma. "Find somebody for me. I am in no hurry."</p>

	<p>"And make her like myself," Emma responded.</p>

	<p>"Of course."</p>

	<p>"Very well, you shall have a charming wife," Emma declared.</p>

	<p>"She must be lively with hazel eyes. I ask for nothing else."</p>

	<p>Emma was delighted. Aside from the hazel eyes, Harriet could be the charming wife Frank Churchill requested.</p>

	<p>Jane then turned to her aunt, "shall we join Mrs Elton now?"</p>

	<p>"I am quite ready for a walk. I was ready to walk with her before when she requested, but now is a good time to go, as well&#151;"</p>

	<p>They walked off, and were soon followed by Mr Knightley. Mr Weston, his son, Emma, and Harriet only remained sitting. Frank Churchill continued to speak, and Emma soon wished she had gone quietly walking with the others, instead of listening to Frank Churchill's many compliments to her. She was grateful to see the carriages arrive to take the party back to Highbury; of course, Mrs Elton insisted that her carriage arrive first. Emma was content during the quiet drive home, without the company of such a strange group of people.</p>

	<p>While waiting for the carriage, Mr Knightley soon came to her. He looked around, and then quietly said:</p>

	<p>"Emma, I must speak to you about your behaviour today," he paused, "how could you be so impolite to Miss Bates? Why did you make fun of her when she was telling a riddle?"</p>

	<p>Emma remembered, and felt embarrassed for her behaviour, but tried to laugh.</p>

	<p>"Miss Bates did not understand my meaning, I am sure."</p>

	<p>"She did understand, and she spoke of it later in the day. She was grateful that you pay her such close attention. Miss Bates was so humble when she spoke of you. She is poor, you should be more compassionate about her situation. She is so humble, and you teased her while in the company of others. Perhaps the others will now disrespect Miss Bates as you did. I am telling you this because I am your friend, so I will be truthful. I hope that in time, you will treat Miss Bates with more respect."</p>

	<p>Emma was angry with herself on the ride to Hartfield. She had thoughtlessly treated Miss Bates terribly. How could she have been so cruel to Miss Bates! And she had not said one word to Mr Knightley when they parted, not one word of thanks to him. As she thought about her behaviour more, she became angrier with herself. Emma felt tears run down her face all the way home.</p>
