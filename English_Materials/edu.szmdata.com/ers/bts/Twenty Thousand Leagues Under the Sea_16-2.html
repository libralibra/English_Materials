	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER SIXTEEN</p>

	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">A Sea Forest</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">A</span>s we came closer to the forest, I saw that it was made up of large tree-like plants. I was astonished to see the branches of the trees all reaching up towards the sun. There were no broken branches on the sea floor. The sea was calm and the sea trees were still. Soon after we arrived in the forest, Captain Nemo decided we should rest for some time. I fell asleep looking up at the great sea trees. When I awoke, I was terrified to see a giant sea spider looking at me closely. Captain Nemo noticed this monster, as well, and quickly shot the animal. I then saw the giant spider fall from the trees. That animal reminded me that there are many more sea animals I should fear in that mysterious sea forest. I thought this event would end our expedition, but Captain Nemo decided we would continue, and we were soon seventy-five fathoms below the surface of the water.</p>

	<p>Captain Nemo turned on the electric lantern, which soon attracted a number of sea animals, curious to see where the light had come from. After a few more hours of walking, we came to a wall made up of rocks. It was the earth! Here was the beginning of the island.</p>

	<p>We then began our return to the Nautilus. This new path was quite steep, making the walk rather painful. I then heard the captain shoot his gun, and a large sea animal ahead of us then fell to the ocean floor. Captain Nemo then put the great animal over his shoulder, and we continued our journey. After another two hours of walking, I was horrified to see two sharks nearby. They were terrible-looking animals, with iron jaws that could easily crush a human. Luckily, these terrible monsters did not see us as they swam by, as sharks have terrible sight. Half an hour after, we arrived at the Nautilus. The outer door had been left open, and we entered. Captain Nemo then let the water escape and the room was soon empty of water. The inside door was opened, and we were taken inside. There, our suits and helmets were taken off, and we returned to our rooms for food and sleep. I thought about our incredible adventure for the rest of the evening until I fell asleep.</p>
