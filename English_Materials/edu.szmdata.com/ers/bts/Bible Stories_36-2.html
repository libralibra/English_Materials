	<p class="storyTitle">36. Satan Tempts Jesus</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">J</span>esus, full of the Holy Spirit, returned from the Jordan and was led by the Spirit out into the wilderness. He did not eat anything for forty days and nights.</p>

	<p>Satan came out to where Jesus was staying. He saw how hungry Jesus was.</p>

	<p>"If you're really the Son of God," Satan said to him, "Make these stones turn into bread."</p>

	<p>""God told us we are not to live by bread alone, but by his word," Jesus said.</p>

	<p>Then Satan took Jesus to Jerusalem and sat him on top of the highest part of the temple. "If you're really the Son of God, go ahead and jump off," Satan said.</p>

	<p>"Scripture says you are not supposed to test God like that," Jesus said.</p>

	<p>Satan brought Jesus up to a very high mountain where he could see all the kingdoms far and wide. "I will give you power over everything you see below," said Satan. "All you have to do is worship me."</p>

	<p>"Go away, Satan!" Jesus told him. "It is written in the commandments that we are to worship no one but God j"</p>

	<p>Then Satan knew that Jesus could not be tempted, so he went away.</p>
