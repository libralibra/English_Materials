	<p class="storyTitle">51. A Good Samaritan</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">A</span> teacher of the law asked Jesus, "What must I do to get to heaven?"</p>

	<p>Jesus said, "What does the Bible tell you?"</p>

	<p>"That you must love the Lord and love your neighbor," answered the teacher.</p>

	<p>"You are right," said Jesus.</p>

	<p>"But who is our neighbor?" asked the teacher.</p>

	<p>Jesus told him this story:</p>

	<p>"Robbers attacked a man traveling from Jerusalem to the town of Jericho. They beat him and stole his money. A priest came by shortly after, but he pretended not to see the injured man. Another person came along, looked at the man, but walked away. Then a Samaritan discovered the man, and stopped to help him. He carried him to an inn and cared for him."</p>

	<p>Jesus asked the teacher which of these three men acted like a neighbor to the man who was hurt.</p>

	<p>"The one who stopped to help him," said the teacher.</p>

	<p>"Then that is what you must do," said Jesus.</p>
