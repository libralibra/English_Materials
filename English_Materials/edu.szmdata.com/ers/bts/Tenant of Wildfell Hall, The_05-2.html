	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER FIVE</p>

	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">The Studio</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">L</span>ater in the month, Rose and I went to Wildfell Hall for a visit. We were surprised to see that as we entered the house, our first sight was of a painting being finished. Nearby against the wall were several drawings and a few finished paintings, mostly of the countryside.</p>

	<p>"Welcome to my studio," said Mrs Graham.</p>

	<p>"Please continue your work, we do not want to disturb you," I said.</p>

	<p>"Oh, no!" she replied, as she quickly put her brush down on the table. "I appreciate you visiting me, and must take some time to be with you."</p>

	<p>"You have almost completed your painting," said I, looking at the painting closely. "Why have you called it Fernley Manor, instead of Wildfell Hall?" I asked.</p>

	<p>But immediately, I realized that asking such a question was quite impolite. She looked quite embarrassed and paused before she replied, "Because I have friends who should not know where I am currently living. They may see the picture and recognize the style. I, as well, did not put my name to the painting. I must be careful."</p>

	<p>"So, you plan to sell the painting?" I asked.</p>

	<p>"Yes."</p>

	<p>"Mamma sends all her pictures to London," said Arthur, "and somebody sells them there for her, and sends us the money."</p>

	<p>Mrs Graham was looking out the window when she suddenly jumped from her seat, saying, "Excuse me one moment," and hurried from the room, and shut the door behind her.</p>

	<p>"It's Mamma's friend," said Arthur.</p>

	<p>Rose and I looked at each other.</p>

	<p>I began looking through her other paintings, and soon found one facing the wall. I looked at it carefully. It was of a young man, handsome, but overconfident. The painting had obviously been done many years ago, for the paint had somewhat faded.</p>

	<p>She soon returned.</p>

	<p>"I hope it is not impolite to look at a picture that the artist has turned to the wall, but may I ask&#151;</p>

	<p>"I believe it is quite impolite, indeed, and so I hope you will not ask me any questions about it," she said, looking quite annoyed.</p>

	<p>"I was only going to ask if you had painted it yourself," I said, as she took the painting from me.</p>

	<p>She did not answer. As we were leaving, however, she turned to me, "I'm sorry I was impolite with you earlier."</p>

	<p>I accepted her apology, and we parted as good friends.</p>
