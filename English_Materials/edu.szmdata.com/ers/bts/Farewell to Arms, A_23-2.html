	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">R</span>inaldi and the major left, but the priest and I remained in the dining hall to talk a while.</p>

	<p>"It's nice to see you again!" I said.</p>

	<p>"Me too. So, tell me, how is everything?" He asked with a smile.</p>

	<p>"Everything is good. My leg is better. I'm a little sleepy today, though. What about you? How have you been?"</p>

	<p>"Since you left, things have become quite terrible. I guess one good thing about it is that everybody has woken up now. The war has become real to them suddenly. That, I think is good." He looked very upset.</p>

	<p>"Why is that good?"</p>

	<p>"It's good because I think it will help to end the fighting sooner. I'm almost sure that it will end soon."</p>

	<p>"Who will stop fighting?"</p>

	<p>"Everyone."</p>

	<p>"But how? Do you think the war will end without a winner or loser? Of course, someone has to win. That's the only way that wars can end."</p>

	<p>"You are upsetting me."</p>

	<p>"I'm not trying to upset you. I want this war to end as much as you do, but I know what will have to happen. We have been losing recently. That's what everyone has told me here. Losing makes people calm down and think a bit more clearly. The Austrians, however, have been winning recently. I don't think that ideas about ending the war are entering their minds."</p>

	<p>"But nobody really wins in a war. Everybody loses."</p>

	<p>"I agree, but one side has to lose more than the other."</p>

	<p>"Then I don't know what I want anymore. I wish that somebody would just hurry up and finish all this. I pray it will end soon."</p>

	<p>"I'm pretty sleepy, father. I've enjoyed our talk as usual, but I think I really need to go to bed."</p>

	<p>"Of course. I apologize for keeping you up so long with my endless complaining. Go get some sleep."</p>

	<p>"Good night then," I said.</p>

	<p>"Good night."</p>
