	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">S</span>he met Henry in Dolly's yard. When they started to talk, he immediately became a businessman.</p>

	<p>"So, is she as ill as we feared?"</p>

	<p>"I'm afraid so," Margaret answered.</p>

	<p>"Oh, this is terrible. Well, then I must ask you two very important questions. I know that you won't want to hear them, but we can't go and behave like children and avoid the truth. Was she wearing a wedding ring?"</p>

	<p>"No, she wasn't."</p>

	<p>He waited for a moment. The silence made Margaret very uncomfortable. She felt that he was judging Helen unfairly.</p>

	<p>"Did she say who the man was?"</p>

	<p>"No, she didn't say, nor did I ask her to tell me."</p>

	<p>"But we must bring this man to justice! He must pay for what he has done! Is there anything that you found out that might be of some help to us?"</p>

	<p>"Who do you mean when you say 'us'?"</p>

	<p>"Oh, I asked Charles to come at once. I forgot to tell you. He's also bringing Tibby with him."</p>

	<p>Margaret's discomfort increased twice as much as before. Why would Charles have to be involved? This had nothing at all to do with him! And Tibby? How could he help?</p>

	<p>"We cannot force whoever the man is to marry Helen. Besides, he might already be married," Margaret said.</p>

	<p>"He still must be punished somehow."</p>

	<p>Margaret was tired of such talk. None of that mattered to her right now. What mattered most was her sister and Howards End.</p>

	<p>"Henry," she started, "I have to ask your permission for my sister to stay at Howards End tonight."</p>

	<p>"But I thought we'd put her up in a hotel tonight. Why Howards End?"</p>

	<p>"Well, she's seen all of our furniture in there and it has made her miss home. She would like to stay there with me for the night."</p>

	<p>"You too? But Howards End has no meaning for her&#160;...&#160;" Henry stopped for a moment, trying to think of other excuses not to let her stay. "What if she likes it so much that she never leaves?"</p>

	<p>"And what would be wrong with that? Anyway, she only wants one night. That's all."</p>

	<p>"But you must be here when Charles comes home!"</p>

	<p>"What has Charles to do with any of this? I don't see any connection."</p>

	<p>"Howards End will be his when I die. He is the future owner of the house."</p>

	<p>"Again, I see no connection. Henry, my sister is a sad girl. She has only one request and then she will leave England. No one has to know that she stayed at Howards End. Your family will not be ruined by allowing her to stay in your home for one night. She is someone to be forgiven, just as you have been forgiven, Henry. So, will you or will you not let her stay?"</p>

	<p>"No, I'm sorry but she must leave right away," he answered, rising from his seat and preparing to walk into the house.</p>

	<p>At this, Margaret lost control over her anger. She jumped up and grabbed hold of both of Henry's hands.</p>

	<p>"You will listen to me, whether you want to or not! I'm going to make you see who you really are! I'm no longer here to protect you like a little child, to help you hide from yourself! You have done the same thing that Helen has done! You were forgiven. I have forgiven you, but now you throw Helen out of your own house!"</p>

	<p>"It's not the same," he weakly replied.</p>

	<p>"How is it not the same? Unless you mean that you hurt your wife, while Helen has hurt only herself!"</p>

	<p>And then the pointlessness of trying to argue with Henry became painfully obvious.</p>

	<p>"I see that you are trying to threaten me with telling others about my past if I don't give you what you want. I will not allow you to continue to do that. My answer is final. Neither you nor Helen may stay at Howards End."</p>

	<p>And then he walked into the house, wiping the sweat from his forehead as he did so.</p>
