	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER EIGHTEEN</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">M</span>r Frank Churchill did not come. A letter was sent to the Westons, explaining that, for the present, he had no time for a visit, but still he looked forward with the hope of coming. Mrs Weston was quite disappointed, more so than her husband. For half an hour Mr Weston was surprised and sorry; but then he thought that Frank's coming two or three months later would be a much better plan. The weather would be better, and he would be able to stay longer. Mrs Weston, however, knew this letter was another excuse; she believed that in two or three months another similar letter would come, but Frank would not.</p>

	<p>Emma was not too upset about Frank Churchill's not coming, although she was disappointed for the Westons. When she told Mr George Knightley about the letter, he was not surprised.</p>

	<p>"The Churchills are very likely to blame," said Mr Knightley coolly, "but if Frank wanted to come himself, he would find a way."</p>

	<p>"Of course he wants to come, but his aunt and uncle will not allow him to leave."</p>

	<p>"If Frank Churchill wanted to see his father, he would have told his relatives he was going. A little while ago, I heard he went to Weymouth for a vacation. This shows that he can leave the Churchills, but he will not leave to visit his own father, Mr Weston," Mr Knightley replied.</p>

	<p>"You do not understand his family. It is very unfair to judge someone's personality without meeting that individual. You must understand how difficult for him it is to oppose the people who have raised him."</p>

	<p>"Yes, he can write a beautiful letter, and tell himself this is the best method to satisfy his relatives, but these letters prevent his father from complaining. His letters anger me greatly."</p>

	<p>"The letters seem to satisfy everyone else. They do not share your opinion."</p>

	<p>"I believe the letters do not satisfy Mrs Weston. If Mrs Weston was of a higher class, Frank Churchill would have come to visit."</p>

	<p>Emma was surprised at Mr Knightley's strong dislike for Frank Churchill. She felt his anger was unjust; he seemed to dislike Mr Churchill because his personality differed from his own.</p>
