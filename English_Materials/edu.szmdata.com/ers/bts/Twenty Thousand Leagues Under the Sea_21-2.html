	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE</p>

	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">Captain Nemo's Electric Shock</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">W</span>e looked to the edge of the forest where the stone had fallen from. A second stone hit the bird in Conseil's hand. We stood up quickly, holding our weapons, ready for an attack.</p>

	<p>"To the boat!" I said quickly, hurrying to the sea. Natives of the island were now running towards us, looking rather angry. Stones continued to fly towards us.</p>

	<p>Ned Land carried the great pig in one arm with the kangaroos in the other, while still running quickly. In two minutes, we were on the boat, hurrying towards the submarine. Soon enough, one hundred island natives ran into the water, screaming and throwing rocks as they followed us. In twenty minutes, we were back on the Nautilus, but could see no one else onboard.</p>

	<p>I then went to the sitting room where I found Captain Nemo.</p>

	<p>"Captain!" I said. "There are nearly one hundred natives of the island coming towards the submarine."</p>

	<p>"Professor Aronnax," replied the captain calmly, "there is no reason to fear an attack from them." He said nothing more.</p>

	<p>I returned to the platform, and watched the natives waiting for our return to the beach. The next morning, the 8th of January, at six o'clock, I went up to the platform. The natives were there, but now had between 500 and 600 people together. During the day, they remained on the beach, gesturing for me to return. I declined this invitation, however. Ned Land was quite disappointed that we were unable to return to the island for more meat treasures. At eleven o'clock in the morning, the natives were still on the beach, although I had not seen them with any boats. Some minutes later, however, several boats filled with the natives surrounded the Nautilus. For some time, they waited, confused at seeing this mysterious ship, not looking like the usual ships that passed through. Soon, the natives moved closer, now shooting arrows at the Nautilus.</p>

	<p>I went down to the sitting room, but no one was there. I then went to the captain's room to explain the troubling situation.</p>

	<p>"Ah!" said the captain. "They have come with their small boats?"</p>

	<p>"Yes, sir. They may soon enter the submarine if we do not lock the door to the platform."</p>

	<p>"Well, sir, let them come in. I have no reason not to allow them in."</p>

	<p>I then followed the captain to the stairs leading to the platform just as the natives were stepping on to the submarine.</p>

	<p>"Come and you will see," he said to me.</p>

	<p>Twenty horrible faces appeared, but the first who placed his hand on the stair-rail suddenly screamed and ran back to the platform. Ten of his companions did the same, and were shocked by the electricity of the stair-rail. Ned Land ran to the stair-rail, attempting to defend the submarine, but was shocked, as well.</p>

	<p>"I have been shocked!" he cried.</p>

	<p>This explains all. It was not a stair-rail, but rather a thick wire with electricity flowing through. Meanwhile, the natives quickly returned to their boats, too hurt and frightened by the mysterious ship. At that moment, the seawater began flowing more quickly, and the Nautilus was soon floating in the water again. The speed was slow at first, but increased, sailing on the surface of the ocean and was soon out of the Strait of Torres.</p>
