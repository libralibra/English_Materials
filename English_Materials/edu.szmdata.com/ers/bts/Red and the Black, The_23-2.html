	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE</p>

	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">The Problems of a Politician</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">T</span>wo days later the family was back in Verri&#x00E8;res. Julien noticed Mrs de R&#x00EA;nal was keeping a secret from him. She stopped talking to her husband whenever Julien came near. Julien wondered if she had found a new lover.</p>

	<p>In these conversations there was talk of a large house owned by the town. Julien wondered what this meant. He soon saw a poster on a wall. The next day at two o'clock the house would be for sale. The time was very short. How would all the interested people find out?</p>

	<p>Julien went to the house for sale and heard two people talking. They said that Father Maslon had promised it to a friend for half of its real worth. When Mr de R&#x00EA;nal refused he was called to the bishop's palace by the vicar-general Mr de Frilair.</p>

	<p>Julien did not miss the sale. He listened to others talk about the low price. One man wanted to offer a higher price. His friend warned him, "It won't do any good. Also you'll make enemies of Father Maslon, Mr Valenod, the bishop, and the horrible man, de Frilair. Let's stop talking, though. The mayor's spy is here." Julien wanted to punish the man, but the sale's time was finished. The salesman gave the house to Mr de Saint-Giraud for nine years. The mayor left and people started talking.</p>

	<p>"The mayor couldn't stop this! Well, at least he doesn't steal," one said.</p>

	<p>Another replied, "Doesn't steal? He will whenever someone tells him. Oh, but there's young Sorel over there. Let's go."</p>

	<p>Julien was angry when he went home. Mrs de R&#x00EA;nal was very sad. "Did you come from the sale?"</p>

	<p>"Yes, madam, and people thought I was the mayor's spy."</p>

	<p>Mr de R&#x00EA;nal came in, and he was also very sad. No one spoke at all during dinner. Mr de R&#x00EA;nal told Julien to follow the children to the house in the country. On the trip Mrs de R&#x00EA;nal tried to comfort her husband, "You should be used to it, my dear."</p>

	<p>The whole family was quiet that evening. Then one of the children shouted excitedly, "Someone's at the door!" A servant brought a very handsome man into the room.</p>

	<p>"Sir, I am Mr Geronimo. Here is a letter for you from Mr Beauvaisis at the embassy in Naples. I left only nine days ago," he said cheerfully. To Mrs de R&#x00EA;nal he said, "Mr Beauvaisis, your cousin, tells me you know Italian."</p>

	<p>The Italian man's good humor changed the evening from a sad one into a cheerful one. Mrs de R&#x00EA;nal insisted on giving him dinner. She wanted to make Julien forget that people thought he was a spy. Mr Geronimo was a famous singer. He was from a good family and very friendly; it was very rare for French people to be both. After supper he told delightful stories. At one o'clock in the morning the children were still asking for more stories.</p>

	<p>The next morning Mr and Mrs de R&#x00EA;nal gave Mr Geronimo the papers he needed to go to Paris.</p>

	<p>One thing astonished Julien. The weeks alone in Verri&#x00E8;res were a very happy time. He could read, write, and think. Could happiness be this easy? I would not have to work hard. I could marry Elisa, or become Fouqu&#x00E9;'s partner.</p>

	<p>Mrs de R&#x00EA;nal sometimes thought of the happiness that she would feel if she were suddenly not married to Mr de R&#x00EA;nal. She could marry Julien. He loved her sons more than their own father did. She imagined living in Paris. All of them would be happy.</p>

	<p>The whole town was not happy, though. They were angry that Julien still lived in Mr de R&#x00EA;nal's home. Mr Valenod had found Elisa a job at another house. She then went to both Father Ch&#xE9;lan and the new priest and confessed. She told them both about Julien's love for Mrs de R&#x00EA;nal.</p>

	<p>Father Ch&#x00E9;lan called for Julien. "I'm not asking questions. I demand that in three days you leave for the school in Besan&#xE7;on or to your friend Fouqu&#x00E9;'s house, since he'll give you a job. You must go and not return to Verri&#x00E8;res in less than a year."</p>

	<p>Mrs de R&#x00EA;nal knew Julien had to leave, but she was very worried. He'll forget me when he leaves, she thought. Someone will love him, and he'll love back. Julien said, "I will leave if they want me to, but three days after I leave I will come back to visit you in the night." Mrs de R&#x00EA;nal knew then that Julien cared for her.</p>

	<p>Mr de R&#x00EA;nal had received another letter, and he decided to challenge Mr Valenod to a duel. It took Mrs de R&#x00EA;nal many hours to change his mind. After a long time she convinced him the best answer was to pay for Julien to go to the school in Besan&#xE7;on. Finally, Mr de R&#x00EA;nal agreed.</p>

	<p>Three days later, Julien came to Mrs de R&#x00EA;nal's room at night, like he had promised. He was excited, but Mrs de R&#x00EA;nal could only think one thought: I am seeing him for the last time. Her body was cold and she could not return Julien's kisses.</p>

	<p>When Julien left for Besan&#xE7;on he could see the church in Verri&#x00E8;res for a long way. He looked back many times.</p>
