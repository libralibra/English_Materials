	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER SEVENTEEN</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">M</span>rs Dashwood was surprised only for a moment at seeing him, as his coming to Barton seemed quite natural to her. During the visit, the Dashwood women noticed that he remained nervous.</p>

	<p>During dinner, they began speaking of wealth and fortune, which Mrs Ferrars, Edward's mother, wished for him; only a woman of fortune would be sufficient for her son.</p>

	<p>"My only wish in life is to be perfectly happy, although my mother wishes for me to become a city or government official, quite a high-class position," He told them. However, Edward had no desire for employment.</p>

	<p>"How strange!" cried Marianne. "What connection do wealth and elegance have with happiness?"</p>

	<p>"Elegance has very little," said Elinor, "but wealth has much to do with it."</p>

	<p>"Elinor!" said Marianne. "Money can only give happiness when there is nothing else to give."</p>

	<p>"Well," said Elinor, "what do you believe a proper income to be, Marianne?"</p>

	<p>"About eighteen hundred or two thousand pounds a year, not more than that."</p>

	<p>Elinor laughed. "Two thousand a year! One thousand is my only fortune!"</p>

	<p>"And yet, two thousand a year is a modest income," said Marianne. "A family cannot live comfortably for less. A proper home with servants and a carriage, perhaps two."</p>

	<p>Elinor smiled again to hear her sister describe such expenses, as she knew Marianne was thinking of Combe Magna, Willoughby's country home.</p>
