	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER TWELVE</p>

	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">Phineas Fogg and His Companions Journey Across the Indian Forests</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">T</span>o shorten the journey, the guide passed to the left of the railway. The driver knew the roads, and said they would gain twenty miles by going directly through the forest.</p>

	<p>Mr Fogg and Sir Francis were very uncomfortable in their seats, but they accepted it in a true British way. They talked very little. As for Passepartout, who was on the beast's back, he was thrown back and forth in every step. He was very careful to follow his master's advice not to talk; he did not want to bite his tongue. The good man bounced up and down, but he laughed all the time. From time to time he gave Kiouni a piece of sugar.</p>

	<p>After two hours the guide stopped the elephant, and gave him an hour for rest. Kiouni drank from a nearby spring, and began eating branches and plants all around him. Sir Francis and Mr Fogg did not regret the delay. "Why, he's made of iron!" said the general.</p>

	<p>"Of steel," replied Passepartout, as he made breakfast.</p>

	<p>At noon they started again. This area was rarely seen by travelers, and the English did not control much of it. Several times the travelers saw angry Indians in the distance. Few animals were seen. Even the monkeys hurried away from them with strange looks that made Passepartout laugh.</p>

	<p>The servant was troubled, though. What would Mr Fogg do with the elephant when he got to Allahabad? He could not take him, it would be too expensive. Would he sell him, or set him free?</p>

	<p>They stopped at eight in the evening at a ruined house. They had crossed twenty-five miles that day, and they had twenty-five miles left.</p>

	<p>The night was cold. The driver lit a fire, and the travelers ate dinner. The guide watched Kiouni, who slept standing against a tree. Nothing bothered them that night. Sir Francis slept like a tired soldier. Passepartout had dreams of bouncing. As for Mr Fogg, he slept as peacefully as if he was home in Saville Road.</p>

	<p>They started again at six in the morning. The guide hoped to reach Allahabad by evening. At two o'clock the guide entered a thick forest. The journey was almost over, when the elephant suddenly stopped.</p>

	<p>It was then four o'clock.</p>

	<p>"What's the matter?" asked Sir Francis.</p>

	<p>"I don't know, officer," replied the driver, listening to voices in the distance.</p>

	<p>The voices became clearer. The driver jumped down, tied the elephant to a tree, and ran into the forest. He soon returned, saying: "A group of priests is coming. We can't let them see us."</p>

	<p>The voices came closer, and the travelers heard instruments and a song. First came the priests, dressed in long robes. Men, women, and children followed, singing a strange song. A carriage drawn by oxen was next. On the carriage was a horrible statue with four arms and a red body.</p>

	<p>Sir Francis recognized the statue. "The goddess Kali; the goddess of love and death."</p>

	<p>A group of monks were dancing around the statue. They were covered in cuts and blood, and they led a woman who walked uneasily. The woman was young, and her head, neck, shoulders, ears, arms, hands, and toes were covered in jewels.</p>

	<p>The guards following the young woman were very different. They had swords and guns at their waists, and they carried a dead body on a litter. The body was an old man, wearing silk and gold. Finally came the musicians.</p>

	<p>Sir Francis sadly watched the group, and, turning to the driver, said, "A suttee."</p>

	<p>The driver nodded, and put his finger to his lips. The strange group walked away, and finally the travelers could not hear the songs.</p>

	<p>Phineas Fogg asked, "What is a suttee?"</p>

	<p>"A suttee," replied the general, "is a human sacrifice, but a voluntary one. The woman you saw will be burned tomorrow at dawn."</p>

	<p>"Horrible!" cried Passepartout.</p>

	<p>"And the body?" asked Mr Fogg.</p>

	<p>"Is that of the prince, her husband," said the guide.</p>

	<p>"Is it possible," continued Phineas Fogg, "that these practices still exist in India, and that the English have been unable to stop them?"</p>

	<p>"These sacrifices do not occur in most of India," replied Sir Francis, "but we have no power in this area."</p>

	<p>"The poor woman!" cried Passepartout, "to be burned alive!"</p>

	<p>"Yes," replied Sir Francis, "burned alive. And, if she were not, she would be treated horribly by her relatives. They would shave her hair, feed her only a little rice, and treat her like a dog. Sometimes the sacrifice is truly voluntary, and the government cannot stop it."</p>

	<p>The guide shook his head and said, "Tomorrow's sacrifice is not voluntary."</p>

	<p>"How do you know?"</p>

	<p>"Everyone here knows about this."</p>

	<p>"But the woman was not fighting," said Sir Francis.</p>

	<p>"That's because they gave her lots of opium."</p>

	<p>"Where are they taking her?"</p>

	<p>"To the temple of Pillaji, two miles from here. The sacrifice will be tomorrow at dawn."</p>

	<p>The guide brought out the elephant, and prepared to start again. Mr Fogg stopped him, and turning to Sir Francis Cromarty, said, "Suppose we save this woman."</p>

	<p>"Save the woman, Mr Fogg!"</p>

	<p>"I have twelve hours to spare; I can devote them to that."</p>

	<p>"Why, you are a man of heart!"</p>

	<p>"Sometimes," replied Phineas Fogg, quietly; "when I have the time."</p>
