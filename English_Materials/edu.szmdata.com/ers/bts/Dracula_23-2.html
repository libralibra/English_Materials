	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE</p>

	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">Memorandum by Abraham Van Helsing</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">4</span> November&#151;I am writing this now for my good friend, John Seward, in case I never return from this journey. Yesterday morning we arrived at Borgo Pass. It's terribly cold here. And we're riding higher and higher into the mountains. The lowland was very green and beautiful. Up here, however, it is mostly rock. Everything looks dead.</p>

	<p>Yesterday, before the sun rose, I barely managed to hypnotize Mina. From what she told me, it seemed that the Count was still floating down the river. Since then, however, all of my attempts at hypnosis have been unsuccessful. I begin now a half-an-hour early and, still, I cannot get her to enter the Count's mind.</p>

	<p>Mina, herself, has slept almost the entire time we have been riding in the carriage. Sometimes she sleeps so deeply that I cannot wake her, no matter how hard I try. She does not eat, either. At night, she cannot sleep and usually remains staring at me without saying a word. All this makes me terribly frightened, but I say nothing to her, for the rest of the time she is her usual sweet self. She has been taking very good care of this tired, old man.</p>

	<p>5 November&#151;Today we arrived at Castle Dracula. Again, I tried to hypnotize my young friend, however, I failed again.</p>

	<p>We then built a fire and prepared some food. Mina, however, did not eat. After dinner, I wrapped her in many warm blankets and then made a circle of holy bread around her. I felt the need to test the circle, so I asked Mina to come over and sit next to me by the fire. She stood up but could not walk beyond the circle. I was happy to see that she would be safe.</p>

	<p>Just then, the horses began to go crazy. The snow that was falling around us began to move in circles. Soon, I thought that I could see the images of women floating in the air. I looked over at Mina and found her sitting very peacefully, seeming completely unafraid. The three women were just as Jonathan had described them in his journal! They came right up to us, but could not get any closer, because of the circle of bread.</p>

	<p>"Rise and follow us," they said to Mina.</p>

	<p>I watched her closely and was happy to see that she was now terrified of the women. This let me know that there is still hope for her. She is not yet completely one of them. I got up and, with some bread in my hands, began to walk toward the women in order to get them away from Mina. Just as I was doing this, the first rays of sunlight began to shine upon the ground. The three women floated back into the castle and we were once again safe.</p>

	<p>Looking over at our horses, I saw that they were all dead. It seems the three women drank them dry of blood. I must make some breakfast and then begin my work.</p>

	<p class="zeroIndentBoldFace">Jonathan Harker's Journal</p>

	<p>4 November&#151;Damn that accident we had in the river! We would certainly have caught the Count's boat if it had not happened. We have bought some horses and are now getting ready to start out. I pray for my dear Mina's safety!</p>

	<p>5 November&#151;The Slovakian men carrying the Count's box left the river today and very quickly loaded it onto a wagon and drove away. Godalming and I are just about to follow them with our horses.</p>

	<p class="zeroIndentBoldFace">Dr Van Helsing's Memorandum</p>

	<p>5 November&#151;Today, leaving Mina asleep safely in her circle, I went into the castle. First, I made sure to remove the doors with a hammer, so that I would not get locked in, like Jonathan had. Then I found my way into the prayer room, where I knew the Count and his family kept their boxes.</p>

	<p>The first one I opened contained one of the beauties that had visited us the night before. Looking at her there, I found myself unable to kill her right away. So amazed was I to see such a sleeping creature. Then, I was suddenly awakened from my dream by a sad cry. It was the voice of Mina. It was as if she were warning me.</p>

	<p>Taking advantage of my clearness of mind, I quickly drove a wooden stick through the vampire's heart. Searching the other two boxes in the room, I found the other two women and dealt with them in the same way. Apart from these, there was one more, large box. There was no mistaking whose it was, for on the outside was written the name, "Dracula". I placed a piece of holy bread inside of it, making it useless to the evil man for all time.</p>

	<p>Afterward, I had to destroy the bodies of each of the women. This was not easy work for me. They screamed in terrible pain and blood flew everywhere. However, seeing the peaceful look on their faces at the very end, gave me strength to complete my work.</p>

	<p>Just before leaving the castle, I said a special prayer at the door and made it impossible for the Count ever to enter it again.</p>

	<p class="zeroIndentBoldFace">Mina Harker's Journal</p>

	<p>6 November&#151;The two of us are now heading back toward the Borgo Pass. I told the professor after he came back from the castle that I could feel my husband getting closer. So, we immediately wrapped ourselves in as many blankets as we could carry and began to walk down the mountain path.</p>

	<p>We did not get very far, before I needed to stop and rest. The professor found a perfect little hiding area for us, between several large rocks. As I was resting, he climbed on top of the rocks and looked towards the river.</p>

	<p>"Mina! I see some riders coming on horseback. They've got a wagon with them!"</p>

	<p>At once, my heart jumped into my throat. The professor made another circle around me and then got out his gun in case there was trouble. Once back on top of the rock, he looked again and saw two more men following the riders on horses, as well.</p>

	<p>"I think I see two of our friends! But I don't know whom yet!" he yelled.</p>

	<p>I could feel that neither rider was my husband. However, just moments later, a burst of emotion ran through my body and I knew that Jonathan was very near. At that same moment, the professor shouted, "I see two more riders coming from the north now! My goodness! This is it, Mina! This is it!"</p>

	<p>I could tell that the sun would very soon be down. It was already at the edge of the mountaintop. Soon, the Count would be able to rise from his box.</p>

	<p>Just as the group of riders was about to reach the rocks in which we were hidden, I heard the voice of my husband cry out, "Stop!" The group of men slowed down, but seeing that it was just two strangers trying to stop them, they began to whip the horses into a run again. However, shots were then fired from many guns. I soon heard the voices of Godalming, Dr Seward, and Quincey, as well. They had the riders surrounded. The professor and I then ran from out of the rocks to join our friends.</p>

	<p>Without hesitation, Jonathan ran through the crowd of men and, with all of his strength, took hold of the box and threw it over the side of the wagon. Quincey, who was on the other side of the wagon, had to struggle with some of the men who attacked him with knives. He eventually made it through, although, with a badly bleeding wound in his side.</p>

	<p>The two men then took out their knives and began to work on opening the box. Their strength seemed unbelievable, for in no time the lid was thrown aside and the horrible white face of Dracula was there for us all to see. At that same moment, the sun went down behind the mountain and the great vampire opened his eyes. His face was full of hatred as he grabbed hold of the sides of his box to sit up. At that instant, Jonathan fell upon him with his knife and ran it through the vampire's neck. Quincey, too, drove his long knife deep into the Count's heart. The body almost immediately disappeared into dust.</p>

	<p>The group of Slovakians who had been carrying the box, all jumped upon their horses and quickly rode away.</p>

	<p>Quincey tried to stand, but had not the strength. All of us ran over to him. His voice came very weakly: "I'm glad that I could help you", he said. Then pointing to me, he added, "You see? She is safe now."</p>

	<p>It was true. The mark on my forehead was no longer there. I had no time to feel relief however, for only a few minutes later, Quincey Morris died in his friend, Godalming's arms. He was one of the bravest men I have ever known.</p>

	<p class="zeroIndentBoldFace">A Final Note</p>

	<p>It has been seven years since that terrible time. Mina and I are living very happily now with a young son, whom we have named Quincey, in memory of our brave friend.</p>

	<p>The two of us recently returned to Transylvania and found Castle Dracula still looking far over the countryside. When we came back to England, we had dinner with our friends and talked about old times. No longer do we feel fear or sadness, for our lives have changed. Both Godalming and Dr Seward now have wonderful wives.</p>

	<p>Reading, again, our gathered papers from that time, it is rather unfortunate that none of it can really be proved. To this, professor Van Helsing had this to say:</p>

	<p>"It is possible that no one may ever believe what happened. However, one thing is certain. Your boy will grow up to understand how wonderful a mother he really has, and how it was that five men could, once, have put their lives in danger to save her."</p>
