	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER TWENTY</p>

	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">Anonymous Letters</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">"W</span>e cannot see each other tonight," Julien said to Mrs de R&#x00EA;nal. "Your husband might know something about us. I think the letter he was reading was an anonymous one."</p>

	<p>The next morning the cook gave Julien a letter. The letter had many tears on the paper.</p>

	<p>You didn't want to see me? Don't you love me? If you never loved me you can tell everyone. I don't care who knows. I've only begun to live since I've loved you.</p>

	<p>Was there really an anonymous letter? I wanted to discuss that, you beast! Tomorrow I'll tell my husband I've received an anonymous letter, too. We will not see each other for a month, maybe. You must write this letter exactly:</p>

	<p>ANONYMOUS LETTER</p>

	<blockquote class="letter">

	<p>Dear Madam,</p>

	<p>I know what you've been doing, and so does your husband. You must stay away from the peasant.</p>

	<p>When you finish writing the letter, give it to me. Then go for a walk. If you see a white flag in my window, the plan is good.</p>

	<p>If you love me, show me before you leave. If we are separated forever, I won't truly live any more. It is a small price to pay for the happiness I've felt in your arms.</p>

	</blockquote>
