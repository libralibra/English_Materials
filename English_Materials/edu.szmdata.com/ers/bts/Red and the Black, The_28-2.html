	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">A Procession</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">I</span>t was no use. Julien could not get anyone to like him. He was too different. And why, he said to himself, do the teachers not appreciate me? Only one liked that Julien seemed ready to believe anything. This was Father Chas Bernard, who also worked at the Cathedral. Some days Father Chas Bernard would walk with Julien in the garden. The priest only talked about the decorations in the cathedral. They were very beautiful, and very expensive. Many were made of gold.</p>

	<p>What does he want from me? Julien thought.</p>

	<p>During class one day Father Pirard called Julien to his office. "Tomorrow there is a feast. Father Chas Bernard needs your help to decorate the cathedral. Go and help him," he said.</p>

	<p>Decoration began at five o'clock in the morning. It was long and difficult work. Several workers also helped, but they were nervous about the highest decorations. Julien climbed the tall ladders easily, and he jumped from one to another. They finished quickly. "Excellent! I will tell the bishop," Father Chas Bernard said.</p>

	<p>When the procession began, Julien started to follow the bishop. "Wait," Father Chas Bernard said. "We have to watch for thieves while the cathedral is empty."</p>

	<p>The procession returned, and Julien admired its beauty. He looked around and saw two very beautiful women sitting to the side. Julien walked closer to look at them.</p>

	<p>When he got close one turned to look at him. The woman almost fell over. Julien had to run to help the two women stand up. Immediately he knew who they were. It was Mrs de R&#x00EA;nal and Mrs Derville! Mrs Derville yelled at him, "Go away! She can't see you again. She was happy before she saw you!"</p>

	<p>Julien was so weak that Father Chas Bernard decided to let him rest. When the bishop came to thank Father Chas Bernard and Julien, Julien could not even stand.</p>
