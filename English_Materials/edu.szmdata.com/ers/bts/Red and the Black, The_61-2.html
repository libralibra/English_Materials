	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER THIRTY-ONE</p>

	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">A Storm</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">F</span>ather Pirard told Julien the news. "The marquis gave you some money. He has also settled his lawsuit with Vicar-general de Frilair, the Jesuit. He's too powerful for us to fight. Part of the agreement is that the priest must recognize your noble birth."</p>

	<p>Julien thanked his good friend and left for Strassburg. He was filled with ambition.</p>

	<p>He was surprised by a servant from Hotel de la Mole with a letter from Mathilde.</p>

	<p>Come quickly! All is lost, I fear. I love you.</p>

	<p>He was in Paris very soon. Mathilde fell into his arms. "My father has gone, but here's his letter."</p>

	<p>I can forgive many things, but Julien seduced you because you're rich. I will never allow you to marry this man. I asked people about him, and eventually I talked to Mrs de R&#x00EA;nal.</p>

	<p>"Where is the letter from Mrs de R&#x00EA;nal?" he asked coldly.</p>

	<p>"Here it is."</p>

	<p>LETTER</p>

	<blockquote class="letter">

		<p>Religion forces me to tell you this. This man was poor and ambitious, and he seduced an unhappy woman to gain some power. I think he has no religious faith. He leaves nothing behind but pain and regret.</p>

	</blockquote>

	<p>"I cannot blame Marquis de la Mole," Julien said. "What father would give his daughter to a man like that?" He left for Verri&#x00E8;res immediately. He arrived on Sunday morning.</p>

	<p>Julien walked into the new church, and saw Mrs de R&#x00EA;nal in prayer. He saw the woman who had loved him. His arm shook as he raised his gun.</p>

	<p>He fired a shot at her and missed. He fired a second shot. She fell.</p>
