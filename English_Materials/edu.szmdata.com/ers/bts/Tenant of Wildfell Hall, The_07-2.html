	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER SEVEN</p>

	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">The Journey</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">N</span>ot many days after this, on a sunny morning, I was outside, enjoying the good weather when I saw Eliza Millward, Fergus and Rose. They were going to Wildfell Hall, and I offered to go along, walking next to Eliza.</p>

	<p>When we arrived, I do not think Mrs Graham was delighted to see us. I did not talk much to her. I was seated near the window with Arthur and Sancho. Fergus was quite impolite during the visit.</p>

	<p>"I do not understand, Mrs Graham, why you chose such a terrible old house to live in. If you couldn't afford to fix up the entire house, why didn't you find a nice little cottage?"</p>

	<p>"Perhaps, I was too proud, Mr Fergus," she replied, "perhaps I am quite fond of this place."</p>

	<p>"And, Mrs Graham," he said again, "we had some questions about your past. We sometimes discuss our neighbours, as we have little else to talk about&#151;"</p>

	<p>"Don't speak, Fergus!" cried Rose, in embarrassment.</p>

	<p>"First, where are you from? Some say you are a foreigner, and some say an Englishwoman. Some say&#151;"</p>

	<p>"Well, Mr Fergus, I'll tell you. I'm an Englishwoman&#151;I was born in the countryside. I hope, now, you are satisfied; for I will not answer any more questions at present."</p>

	<p>"Except this&#151;"</p>

	<p>"No, not one more!" she laughed, and stood up from her seat, and came to sit near me by the window.</p>

	<p>"Mr Markham," said she, "I've heard there is a beautiful view of the sea nearby. Now, could you please tell me how to get there? I would like to walk there some day, and paint the scenery."</p>

	<p>Rose quickly interrupted, "Oh, don't tell her Gilbert! She shall go with us. Mrs Graham, it is a very long walk, certainly too far for little Arthur to walk to. We were thinking of going there one afternoon for a picnic. If you will wait till the weather is a bit warmer, we shall all go."</p>

	<p>Poor Mrs Graham did not look pleased to hear this. She declined the offer many times, but Rose insisted that she would join them, so she finally agreed.</p>

	<p>But this was only March, and April was quite cold and rainy. Finally, in May, we went for the picnic.</p>

	<p>I had invited Mr Lawrence, but he declined. I mentioned that Miss Wilson would be going, and he seemed eager to go, but when I told him that Mrs Graham would also be attending, he quickly refused the offer. So, we went&#151;Mrs Graham and her son, Mary and Eliza Millward, Jane and Richard Wilson, and Rose, Fergus, and I.</p>

	<p>We arrived, and Mrs Graham requested that Mary Millward look after her child while she walk off to paint the sea views. When she was gone, I became quite bored.</p>

	<p>Soon enough, I went to find her, sitting alone on a nearby hill. She did not look too pleased to see me.</p>

	<p>"What did you come for?" she asked as I arrived.</p>

	<p>"I came to sit and watch you draw."</p>

	<p>"Oh, but you know I don't like that," she told me.</p>

	<p>"Well then, I'll sit with you and admire the view."</p>

	<p>For some time, she drew in silence, but soon spoke, "Why don't you go and amuse yourself with your friends?"</p>

	<p>"Because I am tired of them, like you. I see them often, but I do not know when I will see you again."</p>

	<p>"Will you tell Arthur that I shall come in a few minutes?"</p>

	<p>"I will wait, if you do not mind, and return with you."</p>

	<p>I noticed she was not pleased that I was near her, although I ignored her suggestions to leave her.</p>

	<p>The journey home was not pleasant, as Mrs Graham did not walk next to me. Instead, Eliza Millward walked close to me, although she seemed upset that I had given Mrs Graham my attention during the picnic. We soon arrived at Wildfell Hall; Mrs Graham and her son said goodbye.</p>
