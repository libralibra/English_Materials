	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE</p>

	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">Boredom</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">M</span>rs de Fervaques first read Julien's letters with no interest. She began to think about them, but she wished Julien was a proper priest. It would be so easy, she thought, to make him a vicar-general near Paris. Then it would not hurt my rank in high society.</p>

	<p>One day she received no letters from Julien, so she decided to write him. Days later a servant brought another letter into the library, but Mathilde walked in and grabbed the letter.</p>

	<p>"This is something that I will not put up with," she said. "You've forgotten all about me, and I'm your bride!" She burst into tears.</p>

	<p>Julien was astonished. He had two thoughts. The first was of complete happiness. The second was one for Korasov: I may lose everything with a single word. I can't touch her, or she'll hate me.</p>

	<p>Mathilde was shocked by what she said. She opened Julien's desk and saw all of Mrs de Fervaques' letters. None had been opened. "So," she shouted, "You know her well, but you hate her."</p>

	<p>"Forgive me!" she cried, and she fell to his feet. "Dislike me if you want, but please love me. I can't live without your love!"</p>
