	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER ONE</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">L</span>et us start with a letter Helen sent to her sister.</p>

	<blockquote class="letter">

	<p class="r">Howards End</p>

	<p class="r">Tuesday</p>

	<p>Dear Meg,</p>

	<p>It is not quite what we thought it would be. It is wonderfully old, quite small, and made of red brick. There is hardly room for everyone. I have no idea where we will put Paul, their youngest son, when he comes tomorrow. You and I imagined it would be a huge place, like a big hotel. I guess that we only think about Mr and Mrs Wilcox in terms of their wealth, but I have realized that that is quite unfair.</p>

	<p>I am returning on Saturday, but I do not know by which train yet. Everyone is so disappointed that you decided to stay in London to care for Tibby, instead of coming here. After all, he only has hay fever. Everyone here has caught the same illness: young Charles and his father, while playing croquet; and Evie, while exercising in the garden. It is quite funny, actually. Only Mrs Wilcox and I have remained totally healthy. And no one is nearly as sensitive as Tibby about it. I know you will disagree, but Tibby could really learn a thing or two from these Wilcoxes.</p>

	<p>Oh, I hear the breakfast bell. Send everyone my love and burn this letter.</p>

	<p class="r">Helen</p>

	<p>&#160;</p>

	<p>&#160;</p>

	<p class="r">Howards End</p>

	<p class="r">Friday</p>

	<p>Dear Meg,</p>

	<p>I am really enjoying myself here. The Wilcoxes are some of the nicest people I have ever met! Mr Wilcox is even quite polite when he talks about how much he disagrees with giving women the right to vote. We have our friendly arguments and I always do a bad job of defending women. Everyday, we go out in Charles' car to do all kinds of things: see the countryside, play tennis, play cards, and so on. The whole family is here now and the house is so completely full. They want me to stay through to Sunday. I might. Thanks for sending me a letter. Remember to burn this one.</p>

	<p class="r">Helen</p>

	<p>PS. I have fallen in love with Paul, the youngest son who arrived on Wednesday.</p>
