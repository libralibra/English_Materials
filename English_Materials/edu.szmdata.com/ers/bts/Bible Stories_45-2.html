	<p class="storyTitle">45. Mercy for the Widow's Son</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">W</span>hile going through the town of Nain one day, Jesus and his followers were stopped at the gates by a passing funeral procession.</p>

	<p>The people mourned and cried as they watched the body of a young man being carried by. They knew the woman walking next to the body was a widow who had lost both her husband, and now, her only son.</p>

	<p>Jesus took pity on the poor, sad woman.</p>

	<p>"Don't cry," he said.</p>

	<p>The men carrying the body stood still as Jesus came over and touched the corpse.</p>

	<p>"Get up, young man," he said.</p>

	<p>The boy got up and began to speak out loud. Jesus picked him up and handed him to his mother.</p>

	<p>Everyone was frightened by what they had seen.</p>

	<p>"This must be the great prophet God promised to send us," they said. So they went about the country telling everyone the good news about Jesus.</p>
