	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER THIRTY</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">A</span>lthough Frank Churchill sent a letter to his relatives, requesting a few days longer in Highbury, Emma feared that the Churchills might not allow him to stay. The Churchills were upset about his long stay, but they did allow it, which pleased Emma. Soon, she announced the plans for the dance to Mr George Knightley. Of course, he did not share in her excitement. Perhaps he was upset he was not invited to plan the event, or perhaps he just did not enjoy dances. The dance did not seem to interest him.</p>

	<p>"Yes, I will join the party, but I would much prefer to sit at home reading."</p>

	<p>It upset Emma that he did not share her excitement, but she was content that he would prefer to sit home reading than spend time with Jane Fairfax. She was more and more convinced that Mrs Weston was mistaken. Emma felt that Mr Knightley was not interested in Jane Fairfax.</p>

	<p>Two days after the planning began, a letter arrived from Mr Churchill, explaining to his nephew, that Mrs Churchill was quite ill. The letter requested that Frank Churchill return home immediately. He could not refuse the request. Frank Churchill was not upset; he knew her illnesses occurred for her own convenience. She could not refuse her nephew's request to remain in Highbury longer, so she used her illness to force his return.</p>

	<p>Before his departure, he visited the Westons' friends in Highbury to say his goodbyes. Soon after breakfast, he arrived at the Woodhouse home to say goodbye.</p>

	<p>"You must return to Highbury soon," Emma told him.</p>

	<p>"I do not know when I shall return. Perhaps if my uncle and aunt travel this spring, but I am afraid they may not travel."</p>

	<p>"Now we must forget about our dance," she said, disappointed.</p>

	<p>"If I come again, we will have our dance, but soon my father will join me here, and I will return to the Churchills."</p>

	<p>"You will not visit Miss Fairfax and Miss Bates?"</p>

	<p>"Yes, I have visited them, but Miss Bates was out. I felt it impossible to go in until she returned. It was better to pay my visit, then&#151;"</p>

	<p>He stopped, and then walked to the window.</p>

	<p>"Miss Woodhouse, I think you can understand&#151;"</p>

	<p>He looked at her. She did not know what to say. He seemed to want to tell her something important.</p>

	<p>"Yes, you are right to visit the Bates and Miss Fairfax, then&#151;"</p>

	<p>He was silent. She believed he was looking at her, probably thinking of what she said. She heard him sigh. He stood up and looked at her. He was more in love with her than Emma had thought. Then, before either spoke, Mr Woodhouse came in the room. Mr Weston arrived shortly after, and a friendly goodbye was said.</p>

	<p>Emma was sad that he left. They had met almost every day since his arrival. And, before his departure, he had almost told her he loved her. She decided that perhaps she must be a little in love with him, as well.</p>

	<p>"Well," she thought to herself, "Mr Knightley will be happy there will be no dance. Now, he can sit at home reading if he likes."</p>

	<p>The next time she saw Jane Fairfax, the girl looked quite ill. Her aunt declared that if the dance had taken place, her sick niece could not attend, being in such poor health.</p>
