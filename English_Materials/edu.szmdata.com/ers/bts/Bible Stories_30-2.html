	<p class="storyTitle">30. A New Convenant</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">M</span>oses went back to beg God to forgive the Israelites for worshiping the golden calf.</p>

	<p>"Those who have sinned will be punished," God said.</p>

	<p>Moses offered to take all the sins of the people on himself, God saw that Moses was very sincere about helping his people.</p>

	<p>Moses went back to camp and set up the tabernacle. The people watched him go inside. They saw the cloud from the top of Mount Sinai come down and lie in front of the tabernacle tent. The people were much afraid because they knew that God was present in the cloud.</p>

	<p>Moses said to God, "How can we go on with this journey if you will not go with us? No one will believe we are your special people."</p>

	<p>"I will go with you as you ask," God said to him. "You have been a faithful servant."</p>

	<p>So Moses carved out two new tablets of stone and took them back to Mount Sinai. There God replaced the two tablets he had broken.</p>

	<p>Moses stayed with God on the mountain for forty days and nights. When he came down again, Moses' face was shining with light. He and all the people of Israel were very thankful that God had given them another chance.</p>
