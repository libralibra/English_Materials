	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER TWENTY</p>

	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">Determination</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">S</span>eptember 24th&#151;In the morning, I woke up early, and quite happy. I walked down the hall, and saw Mr Huntingdon coming to me. I felt his strong arm around my waist and his warm kiss on my cheek.</p>

	<p>"My own Helen!" he said into my ear.</p>

	<p>"Not yours yet," I said. "Remember, you must first speak to my uncle and aunt. My aunt is not too fond of you."</p>

	<p>"Yes, I know that she has heard that in my younger years, I was a bit careless, but I am no longer that way. And I know that with you, dear Helen, to take care of, I will live like a kind gentleman and husband."</p>

	<p>"You must first speak with my aunt."</p>

	<p>"Yes, you've talked about your aunt and uncle, but where is your father? Can I not speak to him?"</p>

	<p>"No, my aunt and uncle are my care givers. My father gave me up when my mother died. I was a young girl then, and have not seen him since that time. Before my mother died, she requested that I live with my aunt and uncle, and my brother live with my father. So, you see, you must speak with my aunt."</p>

	<p>Many times during the day, my good aunt attempted to persuade me not to accept Mr Huntingdon's offer of marriage, but I could not refuse him. I knew I thoroughly loved him, and he would be a good husband. Yes, he was a bit thoughtless, but that could be changed. Just before dinner, my uncle called me into the library to discuss this important matter.</p>

	<p>"Now, Helen," he said, "this young Huntingdon has been asking to marry you. What should I tell him? Your aunt would answer 'No,' but what do you say?"</p>

	<p>"I say yes, Uncle!" I exclaimed.</p>

	<p>"Very good!" he cried. "Now, when must the wedding be? Huntingdon would like to be married quite soon, and you feel the same, I suppose."</p>

	<p>"No, Uncle. I would like to wait till after Christmas."</p>

	<p>I am in no hurry to get married. I am happy enough to know that we are to be married. I must first ask my aunt about the time of the wedding before deciding.</p>
