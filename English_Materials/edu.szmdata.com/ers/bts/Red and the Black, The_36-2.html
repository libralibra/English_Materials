	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER SIX</p>

	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">What Decoration for a Man?</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">J</span>ulien returned one day from a business trip, and he saw Ms de la Mole again. By this time Julien knew how to act in Paris, and he was not friendly to Ms de la Mole.</p>

	<p>That night at salon Mathilde was very bored. She was smarter than all of her friends. Then she saw Julien; at least he was different. "Mr Sorel, Are you coming to the dance tonight?" she asked.</p>

	<p>"I was not invited," he said.</p>

	<p>"You can come with my brother," Mathilde replied.</p>

	<p>Julien said nothing.</p>

	<p>"Come with my brother," she said quickly.</p>

	<p>Julien was very angry. Am I just a servant now? He thought.</p>

	<p>Julien was amazed by the dance. The room was very beautiful. Many of the guests were impressed by Mathilde's beauty. She called Julien over and asked him, "You have been in Paris all winter. Is this the most beautiful dance you have seen?"</p>

	<p>Julien quietly said, "I spend my time writing. I have not seen a dance like this."</p>

	<p>Some other men were shocked, but Mathilde was not. She said, "You are like a philosopher! This dance amazes you but does not impress you."</p>

	<p>Julien wanted to be cool to her, but he did notice how beautiful she was in her dress.</p>

	<p>The Marquis de Croisenois came over. He liked Mathilde and wanted to marry her. Mathilde did not want to talk to him because he was stupid and boring. She listened patiently, though, and then she saw Julien talking to Count Altamira. She knew about his conspiracy in his home country, and now he was sentenced to death. This was interesting to Ms de la Mole. The other men could buy anything, but a death sentence was one thing they could not buy. Maybe his conspiracy was stupid, she thought, but at least he did act.</p>

	<p>Marquis de Croisenois asked her to dance, and she accepted. Why don't I like him? She thought. The other women think he's perfect. He's handsome, rich, and powerful. He's so boring, though.</p>

	<p>Mr Sorel is different, though, she thought.</p>
