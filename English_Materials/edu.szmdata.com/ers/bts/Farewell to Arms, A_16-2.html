	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER SIXTEEN</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">T</span>he summer was wonderful. After I could use crutches to walk, Catherine and I began to go out on the town. We would have dinner at the nicest restaurants. Our favorite one was Grand'Italia. We ate there so often that we began to know the highest waiter there. He was a very nice guy. He even lent me money once when I did not have any. Usually after dinner, we took a walk on the street and then we would go back to the hospital. Catherine would return to her office and I would go back to my room. There, I would sit on the balcony and wait for her to come.</p>

	<p>I loved being with her in bed, watching her and touching her. We acted like we were married since the day Catherine arrived in Milan. I, however, truly wanted to be married. Catherine had other ideas though.</p>

	<p>"It's pointless to get married right now," she said, "I would be sent back to Scotland and you would remain here. Then we would never get to see each other. Is that what you want?"</p>

	<p>"No, of course, I don't want that. But what if you have a baby some day?"</p>

	<p>"I don't think it's this that you are so worried about. I think you fear that I'll meet someone else and eventually leave you. You are wrong though to worry about this. I was in love before, you know. The only thing that prevented me from being with him forever was his death. I'm a very honest person."</p>

	<p>"You know I'll soon be called back to the war."</p>

	<p>"Let's not talk about that now. You and I are very happy together and we are really enjoying ourselves here. Let's just continue to be happy. Now, do you want to have some fun in that bed of yours?"</p>

	<p>"Get over here!"</p>

	<p>"I'll be there in a second. Just let me make sure the other patients are all right."</p>
