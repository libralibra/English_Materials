	<p class="storyTitle">62. The Trial</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">O</span>nce the Jewish priests and religious leaders decided Jesus was guilty, they took him into Jerusalem to stand trial before the Roman governor, Pontius Pilate.</p>

	<p>"This man refused to pay his taxes," they said. "He claims he is Christ the King."</p>

	<p>"Do you claim to be king of the Jews?" Pilate asked Jesus.</p>

	<p>"So you say," Jesus told him.</p>

	<p>Pilate did not think Jesus had committed any crime. He wanted to let Jesus go, but the leaders did not agree. Pilate learned Jesus was from Galilee, so he sent him to Herod, the ruler of Galike who was also in Jerusalem.</p>

	<p>Herod questioned Jesus for a long time. He wanted Jesus to perform a miracle. But when Jesus refused to speak to him, Herod made fun of Jesus. And he sent Jeusus back to Pitale.</p>

	<p>Meanwhile, Pilate told the chief priests and rulers that neither he nor Herod found Jesus guilty of a crime. "What shall we do with him?" he asked.</p>
