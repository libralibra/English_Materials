	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO</p>

	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">The Department of Virtue</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">A</span>s soon as he returned to Paris, Julien went to see Count Altamira. Julien told his friend he was deeply in love with Mrs de Fervaques.</p>

	<p>"Let's go see Bustos," Altamira said. "He tried to date Mrs de Fervaques."</p>

	<p>Mr Diego Bustos wanted to know everything. He listened quietly, and then he spoke for a long time. "This English woman sometimes hates people strongly. Has she had a lover before? Can you succeed? She wrote me these letters. Take them so you will know the way she writes."</p>

	<p>As Julien was leaving, Bustos said, "Count Altamira says you're one of us. One day you'll help us win our battles."</p>

	<p>When Julien returned home, it was almost time for dinner. He was going to see Mathilde again! He dressed very carefully. Fool! He thought. I must follow Prince Korasov's advice. Julien changed into very plain traveling clothes.</p>

	<p>Julien did not talk to Mathilde, but he did not hide from her. Marquis de la Mole praised him to everyone, and Julien was very nice to Mrs de la Mole. At eight o'clock Mrs de Fervaques arrived. Julien went to his room and changed into very nice clothes. This made Mrs de la Mole happy, and she introduced Julien to Mrs de Fervaques.</p>

	<p>He followed Korasov's plan. Julien pretended to admire her, and he treated it like a battle to be won.</p>

	<p>Mathilde thought Julien would talk to her when he returned. She thought he would try to win her again, and she was surprised to see him only talking to Mrs de Fervaques. He appeared to be cured.</p>

	<p>Prince Korasov would have been very proud of Julien. Julien did not realize that Mrs de Fervaques and Marquis de la Mole had enough power to make him a bishop.</p>
