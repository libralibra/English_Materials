	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER FORTY-ONE</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">A</span>fter going to Colonel Brandon's to thank him for offering him an income, Edward then went to see Lucy. She was overjoyed at their good luck, and eagerly thanked Colonel Brandon and Elinor.</p>

	<p>It was now over a week since John Dashwood had visited them. Elinor thought that she must show proper manners and go see her sister-in-law. Marianne and Mrs Jennings absolutely refused to go, as both of the women now had very little respect for Mrs John Dashwood.</p>

	<p>Elinor went, but Mrs Dashwood was resting, and therefore, could not be disturbed. Just as she was leaving, John Dashwood came to greet her and invited her in. He seemed quite pleased to see her, as he had many questions about Colonel Brandon's offer to his brother.</p>

	<p>"Is this true? Has Colonel Brandon really offered Edward an income? But, they are not related, nor have any connection. Why would he offer such a generous position?"</p>

	<p>"A very simple reason&#151;to be a friend to Mr Ferrars."</p>

	<p>"Well, Edward is a very lucky man, but please do not mention this matter to Fanny. She is still quite upset over the engagement," he said quietly. "You know, my dear Elinor, you will be happy to hear that Mrs Ferrars has recently said that she would much prefer that Edward become engaged to you, rather than to Lucy, as she has no fortune. Mrs Ferrars is quite upset over this matter."</p>

	<p>"I thought she would have forgotten him by now. She does not know how Edward will make a living, but has declared that she no longer views him as her son."</p>

	<p>"Mrs Ferrars can never forget that Edward is her son. She is one of the most loving mothers in the world."</p>

	<p>Elinor was silent.</p>

	<p>"We think now," said Mr Dashwood, "of Robert marrying Miss Morton."</p>

	<p>Elinor smiled, and calmly replied, "Miss Morton has no choice in who she is to marry? You speak as if Edward and Robert are the same person."</p>

	<p>"Certainly, there can be no difference. Robert will now be considered the oldest son, and will receive his mother's fortune."</p>

	<p>Elinor was tired of talking to her foolish brother, and said very little after that. Soon enough, Robert Ferrars arrived, and John Dashwood went to fetch his wife. He immediately began asking about Edward's future income working under Colonel Brandon.</p>

	<p>"We make jokes about it," said he, "but Edward is ruined. Poor fellow! My mother was the first person to tell me of it, and I immediately said to her, 'Mother, I do not know what you plan to do, but if Edward does marry this young woman, I will never see him again.' How shocking this is!"</p>

	<p>"Have you ever seen the lady?"</p>

	<p>"Yes, I saw her once when I came to visit Fanny, while she and her sister were here. She is quite an awkward country girl, without style or elegance. I remember her perfectly."</p>

	<p>He stopped speaking as Mrs John Dashwood came into the room. She did not speak of Edward, but Elinor could see she was still quite upset. She was more polite toward Elinor during this visit, remarking that she wished they had spent more time together during their visit to London.</p>
