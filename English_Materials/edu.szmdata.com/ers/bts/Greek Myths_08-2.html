	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">The Amazons</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">H</span>ercules' next task was done for Eurystheus' daughter, Admete. "There is something I want, Hercules," she began.</p>

	<p>"On the north side of the Black Sea lives a group of fighting women called the Amazons. They have no husbands and no men live within their society. Their queen is called Hippolyte, and she wears a beautiful dress covered with jewels. I want that dress!"</p>

	<p>Hercules knew that this task could be very dangerous and that he could not handle all of the Amazons by himself. Because of this, Hercules gathered together a group of strong fighters and they left to face the Amazons together. They traveled many months to find the land where the Amazons lived and saw many strange lands and strange people along the way.</p>

	<p>When they arrived at the castle of Queen Hippolyte, Hercules expected a terrible fight. To his surprise, the queen welcomed him with kindness. She had never seen a man so strong and handsome as Hercules and said, "Please come in, I will have a great meal prepared for you and your men."</p>

	<p>While they ate Hippolyte asked Hercules why he had come to the land of the Amazons. Hercules was a brave and honest man and answered her truthfully:</p>

	<p>"Great queen, my men and I do not wish any harm on you and your people, but I have come to ask for that dress you wear."</p>

	<p>Hercules then explained about the tasks he had to complete to satisfy the gods and free himself from his service to his cousin. The queen listened, and was not angry. "You may have my dress," Hippolyte said, looking at Hercules with hungry eyes, "but not until tomorrow. Tonight, I wish for you to sleep in my bedroom with me. Tomorrow you can leave with what you have come for."</p>

	<p>Hercules' task was not going to be easy. All this time, the goddess Hera had been watching Hercules, and looking for ways to keep him from succeeding in his tasks. That night, while Hercules slept with Hippolyte, Hera transformed herself into an Amazon and walked among the other women, telling them that Hercules had come to steal their queen away from them. When they heard this, the Amazons attacked Hercules and his men.</p>

	<p>A great battle began and Hercules and his men were forced to kill many Amazons. Hercules felt terrible about killing women and was especially unhappy when he had to face Hippolyte in a fight. She was a fierce fighter and Hercules admired her skill. She jumped at him with her spear and Hercules had to defend himself. He wrestled her down to the ground and made her give him the jewel-covered-dress.</p>

	<p>Hercules left the island with great sadness in his heart. Hippolyte was the strongest woman he had ever met; he had deep love and respect for her. Hercules was angry at Eurystheus' daughter Admete for her terrible greed and desire for the Amazon queen's dress.</p>
