	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER NINETEEN</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">E</span>mma and Harriet were walking together one morning, and had been talking about Mr Elton when Emma decided they should discuss another topic. She thought it would help Harriet if they spoke of something else. Discussing Mr Elton also reminded herself of her error in introducing the two. Emma began speaking about how the poor must suffer in the winter.</p>

	<p>"Mr Elton is so good to the poor!" Harriet responded.</p>

	<p>They were walking by the house of Mrs and Miss Bates at that time. Emma decided they should visit them to distract Harriet from thinking of Mr Elton. Mrs and Miss Bates loved visitors, particularly Emma Woodhouse. Emma still felt rather guilty about Harriet's sadness, and needed the Bates to compliment her. Mr George Knightley often reminded her of her imperfections and misguided ideas, but Emma needed to feel better that day.</p>

	<p>The Bates did not often receive visitors, but were rather excited when others came to visit. The younger Miss Bates, talkative and in her late forties, had never been married, she chose instead to live with her mother.</p>

	<p>"Mr Elton is still away from Highbury. He is so charming," Miss Bates began.</p>

	<p>Emma knew this conversation would upset her young friend, Harriet, so she began asking Miss Bates about her beloved niece, Jane Fairfax. Mrs and Miss Bates' favourite topic is their young niece. Whenever they receive a letter from the girl, it would be discussed for the next month. There was not another subject they spoke of more often.</p>

	<p>"Have you heard from Miss Fairfax lately? I hope she is well," began Emma.</p>

	<p>Miss Bates then eagerly searched for the most recent letter from Jane. "Oh here it is. Jane will be coming next week, what a pleasure that will be," responded Miss Bates.</p>

	<p>Emma and Harriet stayed at the Bates' home for a short time, listening to Miss Bates praise her niece, rather excited that Jane chose to visit her aunts, instead of a trip to Ireland. Soon, the girls left the Bates' home; Emma was pleased with herself for escaping before Miss Bates read the letter.</p>
