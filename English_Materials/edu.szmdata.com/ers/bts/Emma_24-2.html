	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">T</span>he next morning, Mr Frank Churchill returned. He came with Mrs Weston, who he was rather fond of. The three took a walk around Highbury, and Mr Churchill was delighted with everything.</p>

	<p>"How was your visit to the Bates' home? How did you think Miss Fairfax is looking?" Emma asked.</p>

	<p>"Ill, very ill," Frank Churchill responded.</p>

	<p>Emma did not agree, "She is so graceful with such lovely skin."</p>

	<p>He listened, but believed she looked ill with such a pale face; he thought she looked quite sick.</p>

	<p>"Did you often see Miss Fairfax while in Weymouth?" Emma asked.</p>

	<p>"I saw her frequently at Weymouth. Colonel Campbell is an honest man, and Mrs Campbell is warm-hearted. I like them all."</p>

	<p>"Do you know about Miss Fairfax's situation in life, that she must soon find work and leave the Campbells."</p>

	<p>"Yes, I do," Frank Churchill replied, looking upset.</p>

	<p>"Miss Fairfax is rather quiet. I have known her from childhood, but know nothing about her."</p>

	<p>"Yes, how unpleasant. One cannot love such a reserved person."</p>

	<p>"A friendship between Miss Fairfax and me is impossible; she never gives her opinion on any subject."</p>

	<p>He agreed with her completely. Emma felt she knew him quite well, although this was only their second meeting.</p>
