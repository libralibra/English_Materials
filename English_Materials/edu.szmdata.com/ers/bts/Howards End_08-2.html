	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER EIGHT</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">M</span>argaret was soon to become very good friends with one of the W's. On the very day that Helen was leaving to visit Germany with her cousin, Mrs Wilcox sent over a letter inviting the girls to pay her a visit. Helen was all too happy to be unable to go to the Wilcox's, due to her travels. Margaret, too, did not like the idea of visiting their home, but she could not ignore the request, especially now that they were neighbors.</p>

	<p>That evening, after Helen and her cousin had gone, and Tibby was lying on the couch, feeling a little ill, Margaret decided to write Mrs Wilcox a letter.</p>

	<blockquote class="letter">

	<p>Dear Mrs Wilcox,</p>

	<p>I'm afraid that I must be rude and refuse your suggested visit. My family troubled you recently, and I would not want that to happen again, especially between Helen and your son. Therefore, I think it would be best for our two families to avoid each other. I hope that you understand and do not think too badly of us.</p>

	<p class="r">Sincerely,</p>

	<p class="r">M. J. Schlegel</p>

	</blockquote>

	<p>She sent the letter that evening, and, in the morning, received the following letter:</p>

	<blockquote class="letter">

	<p>Dear Miss Schlegel,</p>

	<p>Such a letter was quite unnecessary. I only wanted to inform you that Paul had left the country.</p>

	<p class="r">Ruth Wilcox</p>

	</blockquote>

	<p>Reading this, Margaret became terribly embarrassed. She regretted sending the letter and felt horrible for having offended Mrs Wilcox. Immediately, she put on her scarf and hat (it was November, now) and ran out into the cold. When she gave her name to the servant at the Wilcox's door, she was surprised to be taken directly to the master bedroom, in which Mrs Wilcox lay in bed with a newspaper.</p>

	<p>"I cannot tell you how sorry I am for that letter," Margaret said with her most serious face, "I made a very big mistake. I hope that you can excuse my behavior."</p>

	<p>Mrs Wilcox sat in her bed, clearly offended. "He left for Africa on the 17th," she finally said.</p>

	<p>"I'd completely forgotten that he was leaving. I'm so sorry. Really!"</p>

	<p>"Well&#160;... never mind. I'm glad that you came to apologize so quickly."</p>

	<p>"Helen is out of the country too."</p>

	<p>"Really? Well, then I guess there's nothing at all to worry about, is there?"</p>

	<p>"Ah, so you were just as concerned as I was!" Margaret cried out in relief.</p>

	<p>"I suppose that I was."</p>

	<p>"Do you remember the letter I wrote you last June? I thought that maybe you were terribly upset with us, because you didn't reply."</p>

	<p>"Well, I must admit, I did not want to move so close to your home. But, maybe, things will be fine, after all."</p>

	<p>"I think so," said Margaret, feeling even less uncomfortable.</p>

	<p>After a little pause in the conversation, Mrs Wilcox began to speak with Margaret more easily. She explained that the apartment had belonged to one of her husband's cousins. She then expressed how tired she was from dealing with her son, Charles', recent wedding. She showed Margaret a picture of the newly married couple, and Margaret tried imagining what had brought these two people together. She wished them good luck, all the same. Then the conversation turned to Howards End, for it seemed that Mr Wilcox was keeping Charles' new car there while he was away in Italy on his honeymoon.</p>

	<p>"I was born at Howards End, actually," said Mrs Wilcox.</p>

	<p>This, Margaret found interesting, but most of the other things Mrs Wilcox went on about she quickly became bored with, and, after a short while, said that she must return home to start her work for the day. And just as she was turning to go, Mrs Wilcox said something that surprised her.</p>

	<p>"Do you often think about yourself? I ask because it seems that you don't quite realize that you're still a girl."</p>

	<p>"Why do you say that?" asked Margaret, "I'm twenty-nine years old, after all."</p>

	<p>"Well, I suppose that it's the way you instruct your sister on how to live, and yet, you haven't much more experience than she. I noticed this in Germany, where we first met."</p>

	<p>"I suppose that's true. I haven't much more experience. It's just the way I look at life&#160;... I guess that I just try to love everyone and pity those who are less fortunate than I. It's hard sometimes, especially when things are going badly. It's important to find a balance&#160;... Oh, I'm sorry. I'm instructing you now."</p>

	<p>"That's quite alright. I liked what you said and couldn't agree more."</p>
