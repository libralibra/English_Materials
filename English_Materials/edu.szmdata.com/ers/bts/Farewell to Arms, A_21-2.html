	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">W</span>e went down to the front hall and I paid the bill. A carriage then drove us over to the entrance of the train station. Catherine wanted to go in with me, but I would not let her. I gave the driver her hospital's address, and then took her hand in mine.</p>

	<p>"I have to go now."</p>

	<p>"Take care of yourself and be safe!"</p>

	<p>"I will, and the same to you. Say hello to our little baby for me."</p>

	<p>She nodded. Her face was dark in the carriage. I could not see very clearly. I nodded to the driver and he began to drive away. Catherine waved to me from the window, and pointed to the station, meaning for me to get out of the rain.</p>

	<p>I went inside the station and found the hospital's doorman. He had arranged for a soldier who was not leaving that evening to keep a seat for me on the train. When I got on, I found that there were so many soldiers that all of the seats were taken. Many men had to sit or stand in the hallway. I found the soldier the doorman had hired to keep a seat for me. However, when he stood up to give me the seat, a large soldier approached me. He had a fresh cut across his right cheek. It looked very painful.</p>

	<p>"Can I help you?" I asked.</p>

	<p>"This isn't fair. This seat is not yours!"</p>

	<p>"Yes, it is. He saved it for me."</p>

	<p>"You can't do that. Many of us have been here for hours. You can't just come along and take it so easily."</p>

	<p>I looked around and saw that all eyes were on me. I knew that I was the bad guy in this situation. I thought about it for a moment. The ride would be long and uncomfortable without a seat, but it might be even more uncomfortable with the whole car of people hating me. In the end, I decided to give it up.</p>

	<p>"Take it. It's yours," I said.</p>

	<p>The soldier sat down, and I went to try and find a place to sit. It was impossible. The doorman and the soldier he had hired to help me both tried to find a seat for me. Finally, I told them that it was useless to continue and that they could go. I gave them each some money and thanked them. I then returned to the train and managed to lie down in a tight space in the hallway.</p>
