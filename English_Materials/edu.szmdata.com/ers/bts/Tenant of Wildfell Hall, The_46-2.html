	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER FORTY-SIX</p>

	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">Friendly Advice</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">I</span> was tempted to tell my mother and sister about Mrs Graham's poor story, but I did not. I knew that if I told them, Eliza Milward and Jane Wilson would soon find out, as well, and would find a way to tell Mr Huntingdon. I could not bear to see my dear Helen in such a terrible situation again. My mother was quite worried about me, and my contact with Mrs Graham, but I said little about the situation to her.</p>

	<p>Mrs Huntingdon did not leave Wildfell Hall for another two months. During that time, she never came to church, and I never went near her house. I often went to visit her brother, and asked about his sister frequently. He said little about her, and I was too embarrassed to ask any other questions about her, as he did not seem pleased that I showed such a strong interest in his sister.</p>

	<p>One evening, I met him as he was returning from a visit to the Wilsons. I now decided to tell him of Miss Wilson's poor opinion of his dear sister. I believed that he would no longer show interest in such a girl, who told terrible lies about his sister, and was quite pleased with herself for it.</p>

	<p>"Are you coming from the Wilsons' home?" I asked as I walked to him.</p>

	<p>"Yes," he said with a smile.</p>

	<p>"I need to tell you something about Miss Wilson," I said, then paused. "Miss Wilson hates your sister. She does not know the secret, so she supposed that you two are lovers. She and Eliza Millward told lies about your sister."</p>

	<p>"I cannot believe it," he interrupted, looking quite angry. He soon calmed down, and understood that Miss Wilson was not the kind girl he previously thought of.</p>

	<p>Jane Wilson was quite disappointed that Mr Lawrence was no longer interested in her.</p>
