	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE</p>

	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">Passepartout's Nose Becomes Extremely Long</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">T</span>he next morning poor, hungry, Passepartout said to himself that he must get something to eat. He might, indeed, sell his watch; but he would rather starve first. He must use the strong, if not beautiful, voice nature gave him. He new several French and English songs, and he decided to try them on the Japanese.</p>

	<p>It was too early in the morning for a concert, and if he woke up his audience they might not pay him. Passepartout decided to wait several hours. As he walked he realized that he might be too well dressed for a traveling artist. He had the idea to sell his clothes and buy some cheaper ones.</p>

	<p>After searching for a long time, Passepartout found a dealer in old clothes. The man liked the European clothes, and he traded Passepartout an old Japanese coat and an old hat. A few small coins were now in his pocket.</p>

	<p>He first entered a tea-house and ate half a bird and a little rice.</p>

	<p>"Now," he thought, "I mustn't lose my head. I can't sell these clothes for one still more Japanese. I must find a way to leave this country."</p>

	<p>He decided to visit the steamers which were about to leave for America. Maybe he could get a job as a cook or servant. Once at San Francisco, he would find some way to continue.</p>

	<p>Passepartout headed towards the docks. As he approached them, he saw a large sign carried by a clown. The sign, which was in English, read:</p>

	<center>

	<p>CIRCUS TROOP,</p>

	<p>WILLIAM BATULCAR, OWNER,</p>

	<p>THEIR LAST SHOW BEFORE LEAVING FOR THE UNTIED STATES OF THE</p>

	<p>LONG NOSES! LONG NOSES!</p>

	</center>

	<p>"The United States!" said Passepartout. "That's just what I want!"</p>

	<p>He followed the clown, and soon found himself once more in the Japanese quarter. A quarter of an hour later he stopped before a large tent. This was William Batulcar's business. That gentleman was the director of a group of clowns, acrobats, and gymnasts. They were giving their last performance before leaving the Empire of the Sun for the United States.</p>

	<p>Passepartout entered and asked for Mr Batulcar, who appeared in person.</p>

	<p>"What do you want?" said he to Passepartout, whom he thought was a native.</p>

	<p>"Would you like a servant, sir?" asked Passepartout.</p>

	<p>"A servant!" cried Mr Batulcar. "I already have two who have never left me. Here they are," he said, holding out his two strong arms.</p>

	<p>"So I can be of no use to you?"</p>

	<p>"None."</p>

	<p>"I should so like to cross the Pacific with you!"</p>

	<p>"Ah!" said Mr Batulcar. "You are no more Japanese than I am a monkey! Why are you dressed up that way?"</p>

	<p>"A man dresses as he can."</p>

	<p>"That's true. You are a Frenchman, aren't you?"</p>

	<p>"Yes. A Parisian of Paris."</p>

	<p>"Well, if I can't take you as a servant, I can as a clown. You see, my friend, in France they show foreign clowns, and in foreign parts they show French clowns."</p>

	<p>"Ah!"</p>

	<p>"You are pretty strong, eh?"</p>

	<p>"Especially after a good meal."</p>

	<p>"And you can sing?"</p>

	<p>"Yes."</p>

	<p>"But can you sing standing on your head, with a toy on your left foot, and a sword on your right?"</p>

	<p>"I think so," replied Passepartout, thinking about the exercises of his younger days.</p>

	<p>"Well, that's enough," said William Batulcar.</p>

	<p>Passepartout had at last found something to do. He was hired to act in the Japanese circus. It was not a very good job, but within a week he would be on his way to San Francisco.</p>

	<p>The performance was to start at three o'clock, and soon the Japanese musicians started playing. Passepartout was to use his shoulders to help the "human pyramid," which closed the performance.</p>

	<p>Before three o'clock, the tent filled with Europeans, Chinese, and Japanese, men, women, and children. After a long show of great acrobatics and gymnastics, the Long Noses were set to perform. They each wore a pair of great wings on their shoulders, and on their faces they wore fake noses. The noses were up to ten feet long, and on these noses they balanced and danced. The last scene was a human pyramid. Instead of standing on each others shoulders, the group stood on each others noses. Passepartout filled in at the very bottom.</p>

	<p>Suddenly the pyramid's balance failed, and the human building fell like a house built of cards!</p>

	<p>It was Passepartout's fault. He ran away from the stage and into the crowd, and fell in front of one man, crying, "Master! My master!"</p>

	<p>"You here?"</p>

	<p>"Myself."</p>

	<p>"Very well; then let us go to the steamer, young man!"</p>

	<p>Mr Fogg, Aouda, and Passepartout walked outside, where they found Mr Batulcar. He was very angry, and Phineas Fogg had to pay him.</p>

	<p>At half past six, Mr Fogg and Aouda stepped on the American steamer. Passepartout followed. In his hurry he had kept the wings and the six-foot-long nose.</p>
