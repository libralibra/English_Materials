	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER FORTY-ONE</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">S</span>ince Mrs Elton had first arrived in Highbury, she spoke often of her wealthy relatives, the Sucklings. She proclaimed that in June, she and her new husband would have a grand party, inviting the Sucklings and many from Highbury. She declared that Highbury would be pleasantly amazed with her grand party, and spoke of it often. Meanwhile, the Campbells decided to stay till August in Ireland, so Jane Fairfax would stay longer with the Bates. Mr George Knightley had never liked Frank Churchill, and was only growing to dislike him more. He began to suspect him of cheating Emma. It was known to all that Mr Churchill was interested in Emma. Although, Mr Knightley saw him often staring at Jane Fairfax, and Mr Knightley believed there was a secret between Frank Churchill and Jane Fairfax.</p>

	<p>One evening, the Westons, Frank Churchill, Mr George Knightley, Miss Bates, and Jane Fairfax were invited to the Woodhouses for dinner. As the party was entering the house, they saw Mr Perry ride by on horseback. Frank Churchill then turned to Mrs Weston:</p>

	<p>"Did Mr Perry ever obtain a carriage?"</p>

	<p>Mrs Weston looked quite surprised, and said, "I did not know he planned to buy one."</p>

	<p>"You wrote me about the matter three months ago."</p>

	<p>"Me? Impossible! I never heard of it till this moment."</p>

	<p>"My mistake, perhaps I dreamt it," Frank said.</p>

	<p>After some time, Miss Bates began to speak, "How strange that Mr Churchill had such a dream because Mrs Perry did mention to my mother and the Coles. Mrs Perry was very anxious to have a carriage. Jane, don't you remember grandmamma told us of it? Yes, one evening when we returned home from the Westons. Mrs Perry had mentioned it, but it was to remain a secret. Surprising dream, indeed!"</p>

	<p>They had a quiet, pleasant dinner. After some time, Mr Churchill asked:</p>

	<p>"Miss Woodhouse, have your nephews taken their alphabet game&#151;their box of letters? I want to play a game with you."</p>

	<p>Emma was pleased with the thought. The table was quickly covered with letters. The two were quickly forming words for each other to guess. Mr Woodhouse was particularly content with the game, as there was little talking while they played.</p>

	<p>Frank Churchill placed a word before Miss Fairfax. Mr Knightley was sitting near Emma, Jane, and Frank Churchill, and could see the letters of all three. He would attempt to see as much as he could during the game, as he did not trust young Mr Churchill. Frank placed a word before Miss Fairfax. She smiled quietly to herself. Mr Knightley saw the word was blunder. He immediately connected the word with Mr Churchill's supposed dream, but he could not understand the entire connection between the two.</p>

	<p>Mr Churchill then placed a word in front of Emma; she was entertained by the word. Soon, he gave the word to Jane Fairfax, although Emma protested. Mr Knightley saw the word, Dixon. She looked upset, and pushed the letters away.</p>

	<p>Jane and her aunt soon left the dinner party. Mr Knightley was worried by what he saw that evening. After the guests had left, Mr Knightley spoke with Emma about his worries.</p>

	<p>Emma was extremely confused. She could not tell him the real reason for Jane's anger.</p>

	<p>"Oh!" she cried in embarrassment, "it was all a joke among us."</p>

	<p>"The joke," he replied, "was between you and Mr Churchill, Miss Fairfax did not look amused."</p>

	<p>She did not speak again, so he spoke:</p>

	<p>"My dear Emma, perhaps you do not understand how close Mr Churchill and Miss Fairfax are. It is possible that at one time he admired her, or she admired him."</p>

	<p>"Never, never!" she cried.</p>

	<p>Their conversation soon ended, but Mr Knightley was still upset.</p>
