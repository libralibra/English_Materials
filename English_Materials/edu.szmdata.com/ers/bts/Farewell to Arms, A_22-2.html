	<p class="storyTitle">BOOK THREE</p>

	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">A</span>fter I got off the train, I took a truck to my unit's house in Gorizia. The ground was muddy and wet, and the leaves already had fallen from the trees. As we entered the town, I could see that some of the houses had been damaged in heavy bombing. It did not feel good to be back.</p>

	<p>When I entered the house, I found the major in the living room, sitting among a mess of papers and maps. He looked tired.</p>

	<p>"Welcome back, Henry. Are you all better now?" he asked.</p>

	<p>"I'm fine. Thanks. How are you doing, major?"</p>

	<p>"Not very well! Everything is bad here. Things got worse after you left. You were lucky to have left when you did."</p>

	<p>"What's going on?"</p>

	<p>"Well, three of our ambulances were destroyed. I suppose Rinaldi mentioned that to you in his letter. Now, we've got six ambulances over in the town of Caporetto, and four over in Bainsizza. I suppose you could go over there and take charge. I've had Gino up there for quite a while. I'm sure he could use your help."</p>

	<p>"When do I go?"</p>

	<p>"As soon as possible. Tomorrow, if you can. I'll arrange a person to accompany you. Go have a good rest and get ready. I hate this war! I wish I could get injured and get the hell out of here."</p>

	<p>I left the major and went upstairs. The room was empty. I was very exhausted. Sleep was all that I wanted. Sitting there all alone in the room, I could not help but think about Catherine. I missed her.</p>

	<p>"Here is my brave wounded hero!" said Rinaldi, suddenly appearing in the doorway. He came over to me and gave me a hug. "How does my hero feel right now? How's his leg?"</p>

	<p>"Not bad!"</p>

	<p>"Let me see. I want to check it."</p>

	<p>I took my pants off so he could see it clearly. He put his finger on the cut the doctor had made and then gently checked the movement of my knee. A sudden pain shot through my leg and I cried out.</p>

	<p>"They sent you back too soon. You need more exercise and time to heal. But I must say, the doctor did good work on your knee."</p>

	<p>"How are you doing, Rinaldi?"</p>

	<p>"Very bad, to be honest."</p>

	<p>"Why?"</p>

	<p>"The war, obviously! I have had no rest since you left. I'm always in the operating room. It's the only place where I can be happy now."</p>

	<p>"You look like you've been having a great time," I said. He looked tired and a little sad.</p>

	<p>Rinaldi got two glasses from the table next to his bed and brought them over. "Let's drink as much as we can! I'm so glad that you are back. I've been so lonely."</p>

	<p>"I'll have just a little. I'm getting over jaundice."</p>

	<p>"Poor man. So how are things with you and that English girl?"</p>

	<p>"Things are good."</p>

	<p>"Has she let you have sex with her yet?"</p>

	<p>"Be quiet!"</p>

	<p>"Oh, come on. Tell me!"</p>

	<p>"I'm getting angry with you here. Be quiet, Rinaldi! I don't want to talk about it. I love her. We're very serious about each other!"</p>

	<p>"Of course you are!"</p>

	<p>"Don't you have anybody that you are serious about?"</p>

	<p>"Just you!"</p>

	<p>"You mean to tell me that you've never really been in love?"</p>

	<p>"I'm in love with being a doctor, I guess."</p>

	<p>"I'm sure that you'll find more to care about later on, after this war finishes."</p>

	<p>"Maybe. Anyway, let's not talk so seriously anymore. It depresses me. I'm glad you are back. Let's go eat. But first, I'll have one more drink." We toasted to Catherine.</p>

	<p>We then went downstairs and over to the dining hall. Rinaldi had already drunk too much, but he ordered more alcohol at the table anyway.</p>

	<p>"Let's drink ourselves to death. It will be fun. Anyway, it will get us out of this stupid war," he said.</p>

	<p>The waiter brought us some soup, and the major came and joined us at our table. Moments after he sat down, the priest came in as well. He had just heard about my return and came right away to see me. He had not changed at all.</p>

	<p>Rinaldi was even more drunk now than before.</p>

	<p>"Here, priest. Have a drink," he said, pushing a glass of wine toward him.</p>

	<p>"Oh, don't give him a hard time," said the major.</p>

	<p>"What? Can't I offer him a drink? Priests like to drink. Just like they like women."</p>

	<p>The priest was obviously used to being joked with by the soldiers. He said nothing, but simply smiled at me.</p>

	<p>"What are you smiling at, priest? You can go to hell!"</p>

	<p>"Take it easy, Rinaldi," said the major.</p>

	<p>"Everybody is gone. I've got to give him a hard time while they are away."</p>

	<p>It was clear to us that Rinaldi was full of anger about the war, and he was just trying to release some of it. The priest knew this too, so he let him say whatever he felt like saying. The major did not criticise him any more either. After a while, he calmed down, and we finished our meal.</p>
