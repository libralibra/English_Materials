	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER SIX</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">E</span>dna Pontellier had wanted to go to the beach with her young friend. Why had she refused at first? That was what she was confused about. What was wrong with going to the beach with Robert? And if she did secretly feel that it was wrong, why did she go?</p>

	<p>Something was changing inside of her. She was becoming aware of a different person within herself. Everyday, her knowledge of this person became stronger and stronger.</p>

	<p>In other words, Edna's understanding of herself was increasing very suddenly. It was hard for her to accept at first. That was a lot to put on a young, twenty-eight-year-old woman. Revolutions hardly ever go smoothly in the beginning. Often people have to suffer, even die, in order for the changes to be complete. So many people fail and die trying.</p>

	<p>The ocean calls out to people's souls to come to it and get lost in their own thoughts, to be alone with it. The water of the sea gently put its arms around you and makes you feel safe.</p>
