	<p class="storyTitle">37. Fishermen Become Followers</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">J</span>esus learned that John the Baptist had been put in prison. The king didn't like the idea that John was telling people about a new king who would reign over Israel.</p>

	<p>John was being held in Galilee, so Jesus left his home and headed in that direction. He was walking to the Sea of Galilee when he saw two people he knew. One was Simon, later renamed Peter, and Simon's brother, Andrew. They were throwing their nets in the water, trying to catch some fish.</p>

	<p>Jesus yelled to them, "Come with me and I will make you fishers of men instead of fish."</p>

	<p>They left their nets and followed Jesus. After they had walked a little farther, Jesus saw two other men called James and John. They were mending fishing nets by their boats. Jesus called to them, too, and they quickly left what they were doing and followed him.</p>
