	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER TWO</p>

	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">Support and Resistance</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">W</span>hile these events were taking place, I had just returned from doing scientific: research in the disagreeable American state of Nebraska. I was, at that time, the Assistant Professor at the Museum of Natural History in Paris. After six months in Nebraska, I arrived in New York at the end of March with many precious things to take back to the museum in Paris. I was to return to France at the beginning of May. Until then, I continued my studies of plants and animals. I had been perfectly informed about the sea monster. I had read all the American and European newspapers still without being able to explain the terrible events. I sometimes believed there to be a sea monster, indeed, but at other times, I knew such things were impossible.</p>

	<p>I arrived in New York shortly after the British ship was damaged. The idea of the sea monster being a floating island was soon forgotten, as the monster traveled great distances in quite a short amount of time. People now believed one of two things, that either it was a monster with great strength or a submarine with a powerful motor.</p>

	<p>Most, however, could not believe the mysterious danger to be a submarine. That one man could have such a powerful machine available was not possible. Where, when, and how was it built? And how could it have been kept a secret? Certainly the governments of the world would have discovered such plans. Some believed it to be a weapon of war, created by a government, but this was not likely either, as it would be quite difficult to keep such a mystery a secret from envious countries, always watching neighboring nations. This would certainly be impossible.</p>

	<p>After I arrived in New York, several people asked my opinion on the mystery. In France, I had published a long book, called The Mysteries of Great Submarine Grounds. This book was quite popular among other scientists of the world, and I gained a great deal of fame through its success. My advice was asked. I did not wish to speak my opinion on the matter, as I was as confused as the rest of the world, but I was forced to. At last, I decided that this mystery must be a sea animal of great strength and speed. The great depths of the ocean are still unknown to us. We have not yet discovered the greatest depth of the oceans. What animals live in those deep waters is a complete mystery to us. We do know, however, all the living types of animals of the world. We must find this animal among the sea animals we have knowledge about. I believe this mysterious animal to be a particular type of whale, massive in size, with a large tooth sticking out from its mouth, which could easily make a large hole in the iron bottom of a ship. This whale is called the narwhal. Some whales can grow to a length of nearly sixty feet. Increase its size and strength, and you obtain the mysterious sea animal that has become so dangerous. I decided that until I received further information on the matter, this was the story I would believe.</p>

	<p>My views were accepted and discussed often by other scientists, as well as by the public. The United States began making preparations for an expedition to find this dangerous sea animal. These preparations were made in New York, where a great American ship, the Abraham Lincoln, would follow the monster. The ship was immediately sent out, but after two months, the monster had not been seen.</p>

	<p>On the 2nd of July, however, another ship, leaving from San Francisco, California, had seen the animal three weeks before while on its journey to Shanghai. The crew onboard the Abraham Lincoln was eager after hearing the news, and immediately prepared to sail towards the Pacific Ocean.</p>

	<p>Three hours before the Abraham Lincoln was to leave from New York, I received the following letter:</p>

	<blockquote class="letter">

	<p>To Professor Aronnax,</p>

	<p>Sir, the Government of the United States respectfully invites you to join the Abraham Lincoln for this new journey. Captain Farragut hopes you will immediately join him aboard the ship.</p>

	<p class="r">Sincerely, J. B. Hobson,</p>

	<p class="r">Secretary of New York Harbors.</p>

	</blockquote>
