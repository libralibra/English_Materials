	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR</p>

	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">First Quarrel</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">M</span>arch 25th&#151;Arthur is getting tired of the country life. He seems quite bored with everything that amuses me. I find it difficult to discuss things that interest me, and I am quite bored&#151;or annoyed&#151;with his conversation. He finds it quite amusing to tell me about his past lovers, and knows that it upsets me to hear such things. I don't complain, however. I do and will love him still; I do not regret marrying him.</p>

	<p>April 4th&#151;We have had a quarrel. Arthur told me that he had, in the past, had a love affair with a married woman I know. He told me that she had pursued him. I hated her for it. One evening after dinner, Arthur began to speak of her, and I asked him to stop, but he continued.</p>

	<p>I was quite upset that he saw no wrong in having a love affair with a married woman, but he only laughed at my anger. I quickly left the room, and ran to my room where I stayed the rest of the evening. Soon after I went to my room, Arthur knocked on the door, asking to speak with me. I refused. I was too upset and hurt to see him.</p>

	<p>The next morning, he arrived at breakfast a bit late.</p>

	<p>"Are you angry with me still, Helen?" he asked with a smile. I coldly turned to the table and began to pour the coffee. We did not speak during breakfast.</p>

	<p>After breakfast, I read and answered my letters. After lunch, I worked on my drawings, and after dinner, I read. That day it rained, so poor Arthur was forced to stay inside, otherwise he would have been gone all day hunting. Arthur could find nothing to amuse himself with. He stayed at the dinner table for quite some time, taking quite a bit of wine. After he finished, he came into the sitting room where I was reading quietly. One of the servants came in shortly after to inform him that one of the horses was ill, so his trip had to be delayed. At dinner, I had heard him speaking to the servant about making travel arrangements, but said nothing. Now, I decided that I must not let Arthur go to London, or he would become careless and wild yet again.</p>

	<p>"Where do you want to go, Arthur?" said I.</p>

	<p>"To London," he replied coldly.</p>

	<p>"What for?" I asked.</p>

	<p>"Because I cannot be happy here; my wife does not love me."</p>

	<p>"Your wife would love you with all her heart if you would not hurt her with stories of your past lovers."</p>

	<p>"Are you going to forgive me, Helen?" he asked quietly.</p>

	<p>"Yes," I said with a smile. "Then you won't go to London?"</p>

	<p>"No&#151;unless you will go with me."</p>

	<p>And so, we are going to London on Monday, in two days. It has now been four days since our quarrel, and I believe we are both quite in love again. Arthur's behaviour has improved greatly. He no longer speaks of his past lovers, although I wish he had never told me of them. I believe we will be happy together.</p>
