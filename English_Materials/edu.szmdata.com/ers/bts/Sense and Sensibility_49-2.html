	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER FORTY-NINE</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">E</span>linor almost ran out of the room after hearing the news, but remained near Edward. After hearing of his brother's wedding, Edward immediately left Oxford, where he was studying, to go to Barton to ask Elinor to marry him.</p>

	<p>Robert Ferrars had gone to see Lucy, hoping to persuade her to end the engagement with his brother. He had gone to meet her several times, each time hoping to end the engagement. She flattered him considerably during their meetings, and he loved hearing such comments about himself. Within a short time, they had persuaded each other to marry. Lucy supposed that Colonel Brandon's offer was not enough of an income for her taste, and was looking for other ways to become wealthy.</p>

	<p>Edward stayed with the Dashwoods for nearly a week, during which time the new lovers often discussed Lucy's marriage. During one of their conversations, Edward gave her a letter Lucy had sent him.</p>

	<blockquote class="letter">

	<p>Dear Sir&#151;I am quite sure you no longer love me, therefore I have found someone who will love me, and have no doubt I will be happy with him. I sincerely wish you happy in your choice, and it shall not be my fault if we are not always good friends, as you now are my brother. I love your brother, and we have just returned from getting married. I have burned all your letters, and hope you will destroy my notes to you; but the ring of hair you are welcome to keep.</p>

	<p class="r">Lucy Ferrars</p>

	</blockquote>

	<p>"My mother will be more hurt in Robert marrying Lucy, as he was her favorite. She will forgive him more quickly, as well. I thought it was my duty to continue with Lucy, although I was no longer in love with her. We had become engaged the year after I left her uncle's home. For the first year, I loved her dearly, as I was bored with my studies at Oxford and living at my mother's home, so our secret love was my amusement. After nearly a year, however, I realized that Lucy was quite foolish and rather dishonest. I thought it was my duty to give her the option to continue the engagement."</p>

	<p>The two lovers soon decided that Edward should return to his mother to beg for her forgiveness, then after a short time, he would announce his engagement to Elinor. They hoped that his mother would give them a small fortune, but they still had doubts about Mrs Ferrars' generosity.</p>

	<p>Letters soon came to the cottage from their friends. Mrs Jennings was quite upset with her dishonest cousin. When she had run off to marry Robert Ferrars, she had taken her sister's money, as well, and refused to take her along. Mrs Jennings had to give the poor girl some money to go stay with another cousin, hoping to see the doctor again.</p>
