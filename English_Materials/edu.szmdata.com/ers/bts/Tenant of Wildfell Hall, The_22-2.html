	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO</p>

	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">Characteristics of Friendship</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">O</span>ctober 5th&#151;I am quite in love with my Mr Huntingdon. However, he is less warm and generous than I thought. The more I know him, the more I am disturbed by his behaviour. Today, I was quite bothered by something he told me. We were horseback riding with Lord Lowborough and Miss Wilmot. Arthur was riding next to me, and the other two were ahead of us.</p>

	<p>"That Lowborough is quite in love," he told me with a smile. "And the poor fool thinks she's in love with him. But, she wants to marry him only for his title of 'Lord,' which she told me the other day. She will be quite content to become 'Lady' Lowborough. She is quite wealthy, and is only in need of a noble title. He spent all his riches being careless and wild with us in London. He would join us every evening and drink till he was asleep on the floor. The poor man's wife left him, as she could not bear his terrible behaviour and drunken habits. After she left him, he was heartbroken and no longer had his fortune. He declared that he would never drink a drop of wine again. And for a week, he stopped going with us to the pubs. But, he was bored, and returned to us one night, but promised he would not take any alcohol. Since then, I never see the poor boy. He is searching for a lady to fall in love with. He has no money himself, but what a lucky man he is, as Miss Wilmot is quite a wealthy young woman. At first, he was interested in her for her fortune, but he fell in love with her. He told me so the other day, and believes she thoroughly loves him, as well. Poor fool!"</p>

	<p>"Why are you laughing at his misfortune?" I asked him, quite upset with his behaviour, "Lord Lowborough is your dear friend, but he will soon be married to a woman with no interest in him, nor love for him. Does this not upset you?"</p>

	<p>"If I were to tell him, he would be heartbroken again. I cannot help the poor fool any longer. He is in love, and I can do nothing."</p>

	<p>As we returned from our ride, Annabella quickly whispered to me, "I came to tell you that Lord Lowborough has asked to marry me, and I have agreed. Don't you envy me, dear?"</p>

	<p>"No, love," said I. "And do you like him?"</p>

	<p>"Yes, I love him!"</p>

	<p>"Well, I hope you'll be a good wife to him."</p>

	<p>13th&#151;They are gone&#151;and he is gone. We will not be together for more than two months. But he has promised to write often, and made me promise to write more often because he will be busy preparing for my arrival at his home.</p>

	<p>22nd&#151;I have had several letters from Arthur already. They are not long, but are sweet and full of humour&#151;but I do wish he could be serious sometimes.</p>
