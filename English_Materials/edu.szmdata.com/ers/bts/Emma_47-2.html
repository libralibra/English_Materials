	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER FORTY-SEVEN</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">"H</span>arriet, poor Harriet!" Emma thought to herself as she walked home with Mr Weston. "Harriet's poor heart will be broken a second time."</p>

	<p>Emma was extremely angry with herself. Emma decided she must tell Harriet as soon as possible, although it would be incredibly painful for Harriet to hear. The last words Mr Weston had spoken to Emma were, "This news should remain completely a secret. Mr Churchill has requested it remain a secret to show respect to his wife, who he has just lost." Emma promised she would keep the secret, but Harriet should still know. It was Emma's duty to tell Harriet.</p>

	<p>"Well, Miss Woodhouse," cried Harriet, eagerly coming into the room, "what strange news this is about Jane Fairfax. Mr Weston has just told me himself, I just saw him. He told me it was to be a great secret, but he said you already knew."</p>

	<p>"What did Mr Weston tell you?" asked Emma, confused.</p>

	<p>"Oh! He told me all about it; that Jane Fairfax and Mr Frank Churchill are to be married, and that they have been secretly engaged for a long while. How very strange!"</p>

	<p>It was, indeed, very strange; Harriet's behaviour was so extremely strange that Emma did not know how to understand it. Harriet showed no disappointment about the news.</p>

	<p>"You should know that if I did know, I would not have convinced you to fall in love with him."</p>

	<p>"Me!" cried Harriet, "you think I care about Mr Frank Churchill?"</p>

	<p>"Harriet," cried Emma, after a pause, "what do you mean? Am I to&#151;"</p>

	<p>After some silence, Harriet began to speak, "I did not think you could misunderstand me. I know we agreed not to say his name, but I thought you understood whom I was speaking of. I was surprised that you approved of my falling in love with him. You have always known him so well&#151;"</p>

	<p>"Harriet," cried Emma, "let us understand each other now. Are you speaking of&#151;Mr Knightley?"</p>

	<p>"Yes, I am. I thought you completely understood I was speaking of him. He saved me from embarrassment at the dance, after Mr Elton refused to dance with me. He was such a gentleman."</p>

	<p>"This has been a terrible mistake!" Emma cried, "What is to be done?"</p>

	<p>"Miss Woodhouse, you told me that although he is my superior in wealth, a relationship with him is not impossible."</p>

	<p>Emma turned around in horror, "Do you know that Mr Knightley is interested in you?"</p>

	<p>"Yes," replied Harriet, modestly, but without fear, "I must say that I do."</p>

	<p>Emma could not look at Harriet. She sat in silence for a few moments. Why was it so much worse that Harriet should be in love with Mr Knightley than with Frank Churchill? Emma soon realized that Mr Knightley must marry no one but herself!</p>

	<p>After a short time, Harriet began to explain. Harriet knew there was a difference in Mr Knightley's behaviour between the first Highbury dance, at the Coles, and the second dance, where he saved her from complete embarrassment. Emma knew that he thought much better of Harriet at the second dance. Since the last dance, Harriet had noticed that Mr Knightley spoke to her more often, with a kind and sweet manner. When they had all been walking together, he had so often come and walked by her, and talked so very delightfully! He seemed to want to talk to her. Emma knew this was true, she had noticed this change in Mr Knightley's behaviour, as well. He praised her for being simple, honest, and generous. Emma had, as well, heard him say such things about Harriet. There were two particular events that Harriet thought to be signs of Mr Knightley's interest in her. The first was his walking with her alone while at his home one afternoon, the day before the Box Hill adventure. The way he talked to her was quite different than he had in the past. He was very interested in finding out who she was interested in, as if to tell her he was interested in her! The second event Harriet spoke of with excitement was his having sat with her for half an hour before Emma came back from the Bates' home before he left for London. When he first arrived, however, he said he could only stay five minutes. During their conversation, he told Harriet he was upset he had to leave for London; he much preferred to stay in Highbury.</p>

	<p>When Harriet finished, she turned to Miss Woodhouse eagerly, to ask for her opinion on the matter.</p>

	<p>"You told me to let his behaviour guide my emotions, so I have. Now, I feel that he is interested in me, and that if he does choose me, it will be wonderful," Harriet exclaimed.</p>

	<p>Soon after, Harriet returned home. Emma was upset and confused the rest of the day. Emma could not understand how she had betrayed herself. She sat still, she walked, she went outside, she went to her room, but nothing could satisfy her mind and her heart.</p>

	<p>She had been so foolish! She thought she knew the secret of everyone's feelings, but she realized she knew nothing, not even her own feelings! She had brought heartache to Harriet, and to herself. If Harriet and Mr Knightley were to marry, Emma knew she was the cause. If Emma had not befriended Harriet, she and Mr Knightley would never have met.</p>

	<p>Mr Knightley and Harriet Smith, quite an unusual pair. The announcement of Frank Churchill and Jane Fairfax was no surprise compared with Mr Knightley and Harriet Smith! He was so superior to Harriet, in wealth, in character, in everything! Could it be? No, it was impossible. And yet it was far, very far, from impossible.</p>

	<p>Oh! Why did she convince Harriet not to marry Mr Martin! Had she told Harriet she should marry Mr Martin, who would have made her happy and respectable in that class of society, all would be fine. None of this terrible story would have happened.</p>
