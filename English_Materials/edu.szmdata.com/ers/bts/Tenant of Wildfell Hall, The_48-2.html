	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">More News</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">F</span>ive or six days after this, Mr Lawrence came for a visit. As soon as we were alone, I asked him about his sister. He gave me a letter he had received from her that day. In the letter, she mentioned that I may explain her story to my mother and sister, but quite briefly. She said nothing more about me.</p>

	<p>In the letter, she said that her husband's health has improved, although he is not allowed to drink liquor, which quite upsets him, as he usually drinks great amounts of wine during and after his meals. He is not quite content with his wife nearby, and becomes quite upset if she leave his bedside. He fears upsetting her and worries that she will again leave him when he recovers from his illness. She has promised that she will not leave if he behaves well. He, of course, declares that he will never hurt her again, but she knows not to trust his words.</p>

	<p>She has seen Esther Hargrave, who has become an elegant, beautiful young woman. She has still not found a suitable husband, although there are several men interested in her. Her mother and brother are quite upset with her for not quickly choosing a wealthy husband.</p>

	<p>I told my mother and sister of Mrs Huntingdon's secret, and they were both delighted to hear it, although they both felt guilty for not being more friendly to my dear Helen. My sister immediately left to tell the Millwards and the Wilsons. Mary Millward was pleased, as well, to hear the news.</p>

	<p>Perhaps I should tell you now, as I do not know when I will speak of Mary Millward again. She and Richard Wilson had secretly planned to marry. Eventually, they happily married, and he became the minister of the town. Her sister, Eliza, who I foolishly loved for a short time, married a wealthy tradesman, and moved away. I have not spoken with her for many years. Miss Wilson was upset that Mr Lawrence was no longer interested in her. She never did find a wealthy husband to marry. When her mother died, she moved away, living alone, bitter about her life.</p>
