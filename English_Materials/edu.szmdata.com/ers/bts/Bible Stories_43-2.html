	<p class="storyTitle">43. The Wild Man</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">W</span>hen the boat landed on the other side, Jesus walked out onto the shore. A man had watched the boat from the cave where he lived. He was a wild-looking man who had been driven mad by evil spirits.</p>

	<p>Just then the men recognized Jesus walking towards him. He ran to Jesus and fell on the ground before him. A loud voice cried out from deep within him.</p>

	<p>"Don't hurt me, Jesus," it said.</p>

	<p>Jesus asked the man his name, and he told them, Legions, because he was filled with so many demons.</p>

	<p>The demons were very afraid because they knew who Jesus was. They left the man and went over to a herd of grazing pigs. The pigs squealed wildly. They ran over a cliff into the sea where they drowned.</p>

	<p>The men who tended the pigs took off for the city to tell people what had happened. A group of people soon came to the shore to see Jesus. They saw the wild man sitting calmly next to Jesus, and were very impressed.</p>

	<p>"Let me go with you," the man said to Jesus.</p>

	<p>But Jesus told him to go back and spread the word about what God had done for him.</p>
