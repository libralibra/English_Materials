	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">O</span>ne day, the Mayor's office received an exciting piece of news. A letter came announcing that a member of the Royal Family was going to be passing through Casterbridge on his way to another town. He agreed to stay there for a half-an-hour if the people of the town wanted to greet him formally.</p>

	<p>Farfrae's office then became very busy with preparations for the special day, for it was extremely rare for any Royalty to come to Casterbridge. As the Mayor and his advisors were meeting, Henchard suddenly walked into the office.</p>

	<p>"Gentlemen," he said, "I want to be among you when this man comes. Would this be possible?"</p>

	<p>The looks on everyone's faces seemed to indicate that it would not be possible. Then Farfrae, after looking at everyone, expressed the opinion of his office, "I'm sorry, Henchard, but you'll have to watch with the rest of the townspeople."</p>

	<p>Henchard angrily left them and became more determined than before to meet the Royal visitor.</p>

	<p>When the day arrived for the visitor to come, everyone in town put on their best clothing and met at the center of Casterbridge. Elizabeth was there too, eagerly awaiting the coming of Royalty. It was with complete surprise that she saw her father come walking out of a local shop wearing a large red ribbon on his chest and carrying an English flag. He was still dressed in his usual dirty clothes.</p>

	<p>Shouting then began among the tallest men in the crowd, announcing the coming of the Royal Coach. Soon, the carriage came slowly through the crowd and into the central town square. Just before it was about to stop in front of the Town Hall, Henchard came running with his flag next to the Royal visitor's door. He held out his dirty hand in order to help the man out of the carriage. Seeing this, everyone in the crowd let out a small cry. Then Farfrae came to the rescue. He took hold of Henchard's shoulders from behind and pulled him back with great force. At first, Henchard looked as though he would fight, but then he just walked away.</p>

	<p>The ceremony was very short. The Royal visitor shook hands with the Mayor and his wife. He then listened to a short speech by the Mayor and received a copy of the speech in beautiful writing. He then thanked the Mayor, got back into his carriage, and continued on his journey to the West of England.</p>

	<p>Lucetta had never felt so good. Having just shaken the hand of Royalty, she felt as though she and her husband had climbed to the top of life's ladder.</p>

	<p>Later that day, after the crowd had disappeared in the town's center, Henchard went looking for Farfrae. He was determined to pay him back for that afternoon's embarrassment. He knocked on the Scotsman's door and asked the servant to tell his master to meet him in the granary in the back yard.</p>

	<p>Henchard then immediately went around back and climbed to the third floor of the granary and tied his left arm to his side with a rope. Farfrae soon came and climbed up to meet Henchard.</p>

	<p>"What's wrong?" he asked.</p>

	<p>"What you did to me today was too much for me to accept!" Henchard answered in an angry voice, "I've decided that you and I must fight now. I've tied up one of my arms to make the fight a fair one. The loser will be thrown through that door in the floor. Because we're so high up, I'm guessing that whoever falls through will surely die."</p>

	<p>Henchard then ran at the Scotsman. Farfrae defended himself and took hold of Henchard's free arm. For several minutes the two men threw each other around the room. Finally, Henchard managed to force the Scotsman to the ground, so that half of his body was hanging down through the floor door.</p>

	<p>"I planned to kill you today," said Henchard, "but I see now that I cannot. Go and have me put in jail if you want. I don't care what happens to me now!"</p>

	<p>He then freed Farfrae and then threw himself onto a pile of hay in a dark corner of the room. Farfrae looked at him for a moment and then climbed back down to the bottom of the granary. Henchard heard the Scotsman tell his servant that he was leaving for the town of Weatherbury. Soon the sound of his carriage leaving the barn followed.</p>

	<p>After a while, sitting alone in the darkness, Henchard climbed back down to the ground floor and left the granary. He wanted to apologize to Farfrae for his behavior. However, it seemed that Farfrae had left town on business. Henchard then decided to do his best to wait until late that evening to go to the Scotsman and beg for forgiveness.</p>

	<p>He walked to the bridge that had become his resting place since his fall from wealth and power. He stood looking down into the water that passed underneath, feeling shame for what he had done.</p>
