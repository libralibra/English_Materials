	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER SIX</p>

	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">Boredom</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">M</span>rs de R&#x00EA;nal walked out into her garden and saw a boy with fair skin standing there. He had not rung the bell.</p>

	<p>She gently said, "What have you come for, dear?"</p>

	<p>Julien was so impressed by her beauty that he forgot everything. Finally he replied, "I've come to tutor here."</p>

	<p>This surprised Mrs de R&#x00EA;nal, and she said, "You know Latin, sir?"</p>

	<p>Someone so well-dressed had called him sir! "Yes, madam," he said shyly.</p>

	<p>She became frightened. "You'll be kind to them, won't you? You won't beat them?"</p>

	<p>She was so gentle that Julien's voice became even softer.</p>

	<p>"Never fear, madam. I promise to be kind."</p>

	<p>As he grew less shy, Julien decided he would kiss Mrs de R&#x00EA;nal's hand. This act might be useful later, he thought. He swore, "I'll never beat your children," and he took her hand and kissed it.</p>

	<p>Before she could react, her husband entered the room.</p>

	<p>Mr de R&#x00EA;nal did not see anything, and he quickly gave the tutor instructions before the children could see him. "Now, sir&#151;everyone in this house will call you 'sir'&#151;you must dress properly. We will go to the tailor before the servants or children see you."</p>

	<p>When they returned Julien had a new black suit. Julien thought Mrs de R&#x00EA;nal looked angry, and with his excitement about the new clothes and home he decided to go to his room for a short time.</p>

	<p>Mrs de R&#x00EA;nal never told her husband what had happened. This was unusual for her, Mrs de R&#xEA;nal rarely hid anything.</p>

	<p>When Julien returned he met his new students and decided to show them what he could do. He gave a copy of the Bible to the oldest child, Adolphe. "Open it to any phrase. Read it and I will recite the rest in Latin until you stop me." The boy read one word and Julien began reciting as if he was speaking simple French. Mr de R&#x00EA;nal was so proud! He had made an excellent decision.</p>

	<p>Even the servants had come out to listen, so Julien continued. He gave the Bible to the youngest child, Stanislas Xavier, and performed again. Mr de R&#x00EA;nal's pride was made complete when Mr Valenod and Mr Charcot de Maugiron, the district leader, walked in. By evening the whole town knew of his ability. This show made even Mr de R&#x00EA;nal respect Julien. No one knew that Julien admired Napoleon.</p>
