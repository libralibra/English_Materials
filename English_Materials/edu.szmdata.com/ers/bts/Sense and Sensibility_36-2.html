	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER THIRTY-SIX</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">W</span>ithin a few days after this meeting, Mrs Palmer delivered her first child, Thomas Palmer. Mrs Jennings was in perfect happiness, and went to see her daughter, Charlotte, every morning after the birth, and did not return till late in the evening. Therefore, the Miss Dashwoods would spend a great part of their days at the Middletons, although they would have preferred to remain at Mrs Jennings' home, but everyone wished for them to spend time with friends. Their time was spent with Lady Middleton and the two Miss Steeles, two girls who they were never pleased to see. Lady Middleton did not particularly like the two Dashwood girls, as they never complimented herself or her children; therefore, she thought the girls to be rather ill mannered.</p>

	<p>One evening, Elinor and Marianne were invited to a dinner party with their sister-in-law, Mrs John Dashwood. The lady having the party supposed the two Dashwood girls were staying with their brother and sister, given that they were related, so the invitations were all sent to the home of Mr John Dashwood. Therefore, Mrs Dashwood was forced to take her sisters to the party in her own carriage, which greatly annoyed her. During the party, Elinor was introduced to Mr Robert Ferrars, rather a selfish fool, quite different from his honest and sincere brother.</p>

	<p>After the party, John Dashwood suggested to his wife that they invite his two sisters to stay with them, after the hostess of the party had mistakenly supposed Elinor and Marianne to be guests of their brother and his wife. Fanny was shocked at the idea.</p>

	<p>"I do not see how it can be done," said she, "without upsetting Lady Middleton, as they spend every day with her. Otherwise, I would be quite glad to invite your sisters. Right now, however, they are guests of Lady Middleton."</p>

	<p>"But they have already spent a week visiting her every day, and Lady Middleton could not be displeased with my sisters spending a week with their brother and sister."</p>

	<p>Fanny paused for a moment, then began&#151;</p>

	<p>"My love, I would ask them if I could, but I have just asked the Miss Steeles to spend a few days with us. They are very well behaved, good girls, and I think we should know them better. We can ask your sisters some other year, but the Miss Steeles may not be in town any more. I am sure you will like them."</p>

	<p>Mr Dashwood was persuaded. He saw that it was necessary to invite the Miss Steeles immediately, and planned to invite his sisters another year. He secretly hoped that Elinor would come to town as Colonel Brandon's wife and Marianne as their visitor, so he would not have to pay for their time in town with his own money.</p>

	<p>Fanny was proud of herself, now she would not have to invite her sisters, who she certainly was not fond of. The next day, she sent a note inviting the Miss Steeles, and they happily accepted the invitation. Soon enough, Mrs John Dashwood was quite pleased at inviting the two girls, as they quickly became good friends.</p>
