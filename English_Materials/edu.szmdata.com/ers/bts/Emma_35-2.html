	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER THIRTY-FIVE</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">A</span>fter dinner, Emma noticed that the ladies made two distinct parties in the sitting room. Mrs Elton spoke to Jane Fairfax, decisively leaving Miss Woodhouse and Mrs Weston out of the conversation. During the conversation, Mrs Elton asked Jane several times about where she planned to find work in the coming months. It was apparent that Jane was not fond of this subject.</p>

	<p>"Here is April," said Mrs Elton, "June will soon be here. I get quite anxious about where you will find work."</p>

	<p>"I had not planned on June to begin work, perhaps the summer. I do not want to look for work yet," Jane told her, patiently.</p>

	<p>"Oh! My dear, we cannot begin to look too early! Are you not aware of how difficult finding work can be?"</p>

	<p>"I not aware!" Jane exclaimed, "I think about this everyday, of course I am aware!"</p>

	<p>"I have travelled much more than you. I know how difficult finding a first class family can be. You must find work with a high class family. I could help you find a family to work for. You must let me help you."</p>

	<p>"The Campbells will come into town again this summer, so I must spend some time with them. Please, do not look for work for me at the present."</p>

	<p>"It is no trouble! My dear Jane, the Campbells do not care for you as I do. You must look for work now. I will ask a family I know; they are quite wealthy," Mrs Elton continued.</p>

	<p>"Thank you, but please do not mention this to them. I do not wish to look for work at present. I will find work for myself, but not now," Jane explained.</p>

	<p>"You must look soon, the time is near."</p>

	<p>Mrs Elton continued for some time. Jane accepted Mrs Elton's advice with a simple "yes", although, she did not look interested in hearing Mrs Elton's suggestions.</p>

	<p>Soon after the party finished dinner, Mr Weston arrived with a letter from Frank Churchill in his hand and a content smile on his face.</p>

	<p>"Well, he is coming here again soon. His aunt's illness is, of course, not serious. Emma, have you read the letter?" Mr Weston asked.</p>

	<p>Emma was worried about her own feelings towards Frank Churchill. Mr Weston, however, was delighted by the news.</p>
