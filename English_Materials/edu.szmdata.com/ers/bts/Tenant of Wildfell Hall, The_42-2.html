	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER FORTY-TWO</p>

	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">A Change</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">S</span>eptember 1st&#151;No Mr Huntingdon yet. If he continues to stay away from Grassdale, I shall be able to stay. Mr and Mrs Hattersley are visiting the Grove for two weeks, although Mr Hargrave is still absent. One morning, they came for a visit, and we all sat together in the garden.</p>

	<p>"Do you want to hear anything about your husband, Mrs Huntingdon?" Mr Hattersley asked me as we sat together.</p>

	<p>"No."</p>

	<p>"Well, I think you're better without him. I'm thinking of leaving him and all those careless men, as I have a young family now to take care of. I'm a better man than you think I am."</p>

	<p>"You should have changed your ways a long time ago."</p>

	<p>"Well, it's not too late to change now, is it?"</p>

	<p>"No, it's never too late. I know your wife will be quite pleased to hear this. She worries so much about your wild behaviour and heavy drinking."</p>

	<p>"No, she doesn't seem to mind those habits."</p>

	<p>"That's not true, Mr Hattersley. She worries quite often, but is too afraid to tell you of her fears. I will show you two of her letters she has written me recently."</p>

	<p>He followed me into the library. He read the letters in silence, and I noticed a tear fall from his eyes, he was quietly crying, but would not allow me to see his face. He had not realised before how he hurt his dear wife. After reading, he walked outside to his wife, and told her he would begin acting as a gentleman and father should.</p>

	<p>"Do Ralph! We shall be so happy! How very, very good you are!"</p>

	<p>"No, thank Mrs Huntingdon."</p>

	<p>He promised to act properly, and she promised to speak to him more often about her fears. They are now quite happy, after returning to their home with their three children.</p>
