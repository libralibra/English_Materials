	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER EIGHTEEN</p>

	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">A Flood of Sunshine</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">A</span>rthur Dimmesdale looked into Hester's face with a look of hope and joy, but both felt fear in their hearts. He was shocked at her bold suggestion of leaving the town together with their child, which he had hoped she would speak of, but was rather surprised to hear the words.</p>

	<p>But Hester, always with a mind of courage, was separate from society, and no longer feared society's punishments. She had been alone with her child for so long, with little communication with anyone but her child. She was now free from society's laws. The scarlet letter had allowed her to go where other women would not go. Shame, Hopelessness, Loneliness! These had been her teachers&#151;serious and wild ones&#151;and they had made her strong, but taught her nothing about the rules of society.</p>

	<p>The minister, however, had never gone through an experience to take him away from the common laws of society. Although, he often feared that he had broken the most holy of all rules. But this had been a sin of passion and love, not a crime that would harm others. Since committing that terrible crime, the young minister carefully guarded his emotions and every thought. He was one of the most important ministers in town, and was trapped in the laws of the church by its strictness. As a man who had once sinned, but who punished himself terribly for committing that sin, he was much less likely to commit another crime, after feeling such guilt for his first.</p>

	<p>Thus, we seem to see that, regarding Hester Prynne, the whole seven years of her punishment and ill fame were preparation for this meeting in the forest with her former lover. But Arthur Dimmesdale! He suffered not only for the guilt he felt for committing his crime of passion, but also for continuing as a trusted minister of the community. He was still an advisor to the townspeople about their sins when he had committed one of the worst sins possible. Now, however, he had a chance to leave his seven years of pain and guilt to begin a new life. The minister then decided to leave, and not alone.</p>

	<p>"If, in all these past seven years," thought he, "I could remember one instant of peace or hope, I would continue this life of misery, to remain here with my pain and suffering as a punishment for my crime. But now&#151;since I am ruined&#151;why should I not take this peaceful opportunity before I die to suffer in hell for my sin? Or, if this is the path to a better life, as Hester tells me, I surely would choose this, to be with the woman I love and our child! I could not live without her as my companion; so powerful is she to continue so bravely&#151;so tender to comfort me!"</p>

	<p>"You will go!" said Hester, calmly, as he looked at her.</p>

	<p>When the decision was made, the young minister felt like a prisoner who had just escaped his punishment, free to return to the world.</p>

	<p>"I feel joy again!" cried he. "I thought my soul had died long ago! Oh, Hester, you are my angel! You have saved me from my suffering! This is already the better life! Why did we not find it sooner?"</p>

	<p>She then removed the scarlet letter from her chest and threw it on the ground. She then breathed deeply as her suffering left her spirit, after so many years of frightful pain. She put her hand to her cap and gently removed it from her head, showing her long, dark hair, hidden under the cap for so long. She looked up into the minister's eyes with a bright smile and pink cheeks, which were usually rather pale. Her hopeful youth and beauty returned to her from the past. All at once, the sunshine returned to them, and all around them was alive and bright.</p>

	<p>The nature of the forest, with no human laws to punish them with, welcomed the two lovers with happiness. Hester looked at him again with joy.</p>

	<p>"You must know Pearl!" said she. "Our little Pearl! You have seen her&#151;yes&#151;but you will see her now as your daughter. She is a strange child! I hardly understand her! But you will love her dearly, as I do, and will advise me in how to deal with her."</p>

	<p>"Do you think the child will be glad to know me?" asked the minister, looking worried. "I have never known children well&#151;they seem to distrust me. I have even been afraid of little Pearl!"</p>

	<p>"That was sad!" answered the mother. "But she will love you dearly, and you her. She is not far away. I will call her! Pearl! Pearl!"</p>

	<p>"I see the child," observed the minister. "There she is, standing in the sunshine. So, you think the child will love me?"</p>

	<p>Hester smiled, and again called to Pearl, who was some distance away. She came slowly, after hearing her mother's voice. Slowly, as she saw the minister!</p>
