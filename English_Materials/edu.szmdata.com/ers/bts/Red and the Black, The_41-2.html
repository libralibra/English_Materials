	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER ELEVEN</p>

	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">A Plot</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">T</span>he next day Julien caught Count Norbert and his sister talking about him. When they saw him they stopped talking. Are these people planning on making fun of me? Julien thought. That's more likely than Ms de la Mole loving a poor secretary. She was from the high class, after all.</p>

	<p>Julien soon discovered that she was secretly reading all of Voltaire's books. He began to think she was completely two-faced. Julien admired this, just like he admired Father Maslon, Vicar-general de Frilair, and Father Castan&#xE8;de. They were evil, but powerful. Julien imagined many things, and he showed no friendship to Mathilde.</p>

	<p>Mathilde did not stop, though, and Julien decided he needed to stay away for a while. Marquis de la Mole had trusted him with some business in Languedoc, far away from Paris. He told the marquis he needed to take a trip there, and the marquis agreed. He did not tell Mathilde, but she soon knew about it.</p>

	<p>The day before he left, Julien was alone with Mathilde in the garden. She said, "You'll get a letter from me tonight. It's important you don't leave tomorrow. Find an excuse." Her body looked wonderful as she ran off.</p>

	<p>One hour later a servant gave Julien a letter. It declared her love! Julien was extremely happy. He had beaten Marquis de Croisenois, a man who was so rich and handsome!</p>

	<p>Julien went to Marquis de la Mole and told him that he needed to stay to look after the lawsuit. The marquis agreed easily and said, "I'm glad you're not leaving. I like having you around."</p>

	<p>This made Julien uncomfortable. I'm about to seduce his daughter! He thought. Oh, but why should I pity this family? I am poor, and they have everything. The letter he had made him proud, and it made him stand like a hero. Still he was careful. He made a copy of the letter, hid it in a Bible, and sent it to Fouqu&#xE9;. Then he wrote out his reply. "Can this really be Ms de la Mole who gave a letter to a poor man from the countryside? I'm sure you only wanted to make fun of me." The letter was as good as something written by Mr de Beauvoisis.</p>

	<p>It was only ten o'clock and Julien felt great, so he went to the Italian Opera. He heard his friend Geronimo sing, and it lifted him high. He was a god.</p>
