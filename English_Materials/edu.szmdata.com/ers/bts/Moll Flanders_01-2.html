	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER ONE</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">T</span>his story took place in England in the mid 1600's, although the book was written in the early 1700's. The main character, Moll Flanders, was born with no fortune or any parents to care for her, but throughout her life she had attempted to find a wealthy husband and a fortune for herself. She was determined to find wealth and live a comfortable life, but found many troubles all throughout.</p>

	<p>My true name is well known at the Newgate prison, although for many years, I have used the name, Moll Flanders. Most, who know me well, know me by the name, Moll Flanders; very few people in this world know of my true name.</p>

	<p>I have heard that in other nations, such as France, if a woman has a child while in prison, the government takes the child to a safe location where it is cared for and given clothing, meals, and schooling. When these children are grown they are able to find honest work for themselves. Unfortunately for me, England does not care for prisoners' children as other nations do.</p>

	<p>My mother had been in prison for seven months before I was born. She would have been killed for her crime, but because she was to have a child, the government did not demand that she die. My mother was sent to prison for stealing a few pieces of cloth, quite an unimportant crime. When I was nearly six months old, the English government sent my mother to work in America. I was sent to live with various people who cared little for me.</p>

	<p>Eventually, I came to Colchester, in southeastern England. I was sent to the church, although the people there did not help me, and I was still too young to work, nearly three years old. Finally, the leaders in the town pitied me, a young child with nothing. They took me to a woman who owned a little school where she taught children to read and to work. I stayed in that place, with that kind woman, until I was eight years old, when the leaders of the town declared that I should leave to find work. I was terrified to leave that sweet woman and her school, and cried quite often about having to leave. I asked the woman many times if I could stay, promising to work very well for her if she would allow me to stay. She finally agreed that I could live with her until I was older. I was still upset, however, knowing that I would eventually have to leave. She realised that I was still worried, which annoyed her.</p>

	<p>"I told you that you will not go to work until you are bigger. Why are you still anxious?" she asked me, looking quite angry.</p>

	<p>"Because I will have to finally leave."</p>

	<p>"What! Of course you'll have to leave eventually. Do you want to be a gentlewoman?"</p>

	<p>"Yes." I replied, and began to cry.</p>

	<p>This amused her, as I did not realize what being a gentlewoman was. I understood that a gentlewoman was simply a woman who worked for herself and made enough money to take care of herself, needing no money from others. However, I later discovered that a gentlewoman is a woman of fortune and comfort. This dear woman thought I wanted to become a woman of fortune, not simply a young hard-working lady.</p>

	<p>After this, she went to the mayor, the main leader of the town, to explain my story to him. He found the story to be quite amusing, as well, and told his wife and two daughters my ideas on work. They were quite curious about me, and decided to come to the school to meet me.</p>

	<p>Soon enough, the mayor's wife and her two daughters came to the school, and asked to see the "gentlewoman," as they called me. They were quite amused, and decided that I would soon become a gentlewoman, indeed. They came to visit quite often, and usually gave me a shilling or two before leaving. Of course, I gave all the money I received to my dear nurse, the woman in charge of the school.</p>

	<p>My dear nurse, however, was so honest that she would never spend the money on herself, but would use the money to buy me clothing or new gloves. She would always show what she bought to the young ladies who came to visit me, always calling me "the gentlewoman." The young ladies would then give me more money to buy more lovely things for the gentlewoman. The ladies would often bring their friends to come visit me, as I was quite well-known in the town now. Many of the ladies gave me clothes, as well as money.</p>

	<p>Finally, one of the ladies grew to love me so well that she invited me to live with her family for a short time, to be with her daughters. Her daughters and I became dear friends, and we grew to love each other as sisters. Soon enough, however, I returned to the school, to be with my dear nurse for another year. I was now nearly fourteen years old, and was quite useful to my old nurse. Although, I did miss the comfort and fortune of the lady's home, living the rich life with her daughters for a short time. I wished to live there again.</p>

	<p>Soon enough, my dear nurse became ill and died. The school was immediately closed, and I was to be sent to work. I was frightened, as I no longer had a home, or anyone to care for me. The kind lady and her daughters came to the school after they heard of my nurse's death. They asked that I go to live with them again. I, of course, agreed, and continued to live happily with that family till I was seventeen or eighteen years old.</p>

	<p>I received the education of a true gentlewoman, as the daughters of the family had tutors to teach them French, dancing, and music. The girls were happy to teach me all they learned from their tutors. I learned quickly, and soon realised I had more talent than the lady's daughters. Many had told me, as well, that I was much more beautiful than the girls were. However, my beauty soon became quite troublesome to me.</p>

	<p>This kind family had two sons as well. The elder brother was quite lively and handsome. He often told me of my incredible beauty, and proclaimed this, as well, to his sisters.</p>

	<p>"Oh, Miss Betty," he would say to me, "you must be the most beautiful young woman in Colchester."</p>

	<p>"Oh, brother," his sister once said, "you must remember that if a young woman has beauty, manners, and talents, but has no money, she's nobody&#151;nothing but money will allow her to marry a gentleman."</p>

	<p>Her younger brother soon interrupted, "Stop speaking, sister, I am an exception. I care little for a woman's money. Besides, beauty will sometimes take a man's heart before money."</p>

	<p>I decided I must then leave the room. I felt quite uneasy listening to their conversation. I soon realised that as the brothers often spoke of my beauty and talents, the sisters envied me greatly. I never suspected what the sisters did that the younger brother was, indeed, in love with me. The elder brother, rather distant and silent, had joked with me about being in love with me, but I never thought about what he intended to do with me.</p>
