	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER THIRTY-THREE</p>

	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">Tom Sawyer's Club</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">F</span>or a long time after that, people were talking about Tom and Huck's money. Now, everyone wanted to look for hidden treasure, and they all came to Tom and Huck for advice. Everywhere around the village they looked under old houses and under the shadows of trees. Wherever Tom and Huck suggested there might be money, they looked.</p>

	<p>After putting their money in the bank, both boys had enough money to pay for their schooling, food and clothing for many years to come.</p>

	<p>Tom was more popular than ever in the village. And ever since the day Judge Thatcher met Tom in Sunday school, his respect for him had become greater and greater. He was proud of him for having saved his daughter. He believed that Tom would one day become a truly great man.</p>

	<p>But for Huck Finn life had become difficult. He was terribly sad, because Mrs Douglas had made him move in with her, and ever since then he had been eating well, dressing well, and was going to school and to church.</p>

	<p>For three weeks he had to live like this, but then he decided that he'd had enough and he ran away. The whole village looked for him. Many feared that he'd drowned in the river. But Tom knew where he was. He got up early one morning and went to their favorite hiding place in the old empty building. Huck was sitting inside, smoking. His clothes were torn and his face and hair were covered in dirt.</p>

	<p>"Huck, you really ought to go back to Mrs Douglas' home."</p>

	<p>"Please, Tom. Don't mention it. It was horrible living that way! Getting up early, washing myself every single day, both morning and night. I had to sleep in a bed. She made me wear those nice clothes that were just too uncomfortable for me. And the worst thing of all was having to wear shoes on Sunday for church."</p>

	<p>"But Huck, that's how everyone lives these days."</p>

	<p>"Well, Tom, I'm not like everyone else! I like to smoke, but she won't let me. I don't like to pray, but she makes me do it. I don't like to go to school, and what does she do? She makes me go! I like my life the way it is now. And you know what? You can have all of my money, Tom. I don't want it. The more money I have, the sadder I become. Just occasionally give me a few cents so that I can buy some bread of something. Could you just go and tell Mrs Douglas all this, so she won't worry about me any more?"</p>

	<p>"Now Huck, she's not going to accept that. I'm sure that if you just be patient and try living with her a little longer, you'll start to like that kind of life."</p>

	<p>"Oh sure! I'd love it about as much as I'd love to fall out of a tree and break my neck! No way, Tom! I like being poor and that's the way I'm going to stay! Besides, we can't enjoy ourselves like we did before!"</p>

	<p>"Just because you have money and a good home, doesn't mean we can't play like we used to. I hadn't mentioned this to you yet, but I might as well now. I'm starting a boys club, but only people who go to school and wear nice clothes can join."</p>

	<p>"Really? That's not a very nice thing to say to me."</p>

	<p>"Nice or not nice, Huck, if you want to join Tom Sawyer's Club, you're going to have to live your life differently. I want you to join, but I can't let you if you live this way."</p>

	<p>Huck thought about it for a moment and then said, "OK. You've got me. I'll go back to Mrs Douglas' and try again, but only if you'll let me join your club."</p>

	<p>"No problem, Huck. Now, let's go. We'll talk with Mrs Douglas when we get back and see if she can be a little less difficult with you."</p>

	<p>"Thanks, Tom. So when's the first club meeting, and what will we do there?"</p>

	<p>"Maybe we'll meet tonight. I think we should all agree to take care of each other when one of us needs to be taken care of, and to fight, maybe even kill, anyone who tries to hurt one of our club members."</p>

	<p>"That sounds good, Tom."</p>

	<p>"And we'll all sign the agreement with our blood in this old empty building."</p>

	<p>"Wow, Tom. It sounds like our life is going to be even more exciting than it has ever been! Who cares about being a pirate when you can be a member of Tom Sawyer's Club! We'll be famous and everyone in the village will want to join!"</p>

	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">In Conclusion</p>

	<p>And now this story must end, because this has been a story about a boy and to tell it any further would mean to have to tell the story of a man. Almost everyone you've read about here is still living happily in that village on the Mississippi river today. It's possible that there may be more to tell you in the future. So, it would be best to stop here for now.</p>
