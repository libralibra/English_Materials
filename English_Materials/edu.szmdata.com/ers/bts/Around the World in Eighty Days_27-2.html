	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN</p>

	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">Passepartout Undergoes, at a Speed of Twenty Miles an Hour, a Course of Mormon History</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">D</span>uring the night of the 5th of December, the train ran south-easterly for about fifty miles; then rose an equal distance in a north-easterly direction, towards the Great Salt Lake. Passepartout, about nine o'clock, went out upon the platform to take the air. The weather was cold, but it was not snowing. He then saw a strange-looking person on the platform.</p>

	<p>This person, who had taken the train in Nevada, was tall and dark. He had a black mustache, black stockings, a black silk hat, a black coat, and black trousers. He went from one end of the train to another, and put a notice on each door.</p>

	<p>Passepartout read one of the notices. It said that Elder William Hitch, Mormon missionary, would deliver a lecture on Mormonism in car No. 117, from eleven to twelve o'clock. He invited all who wanted to learn about the religion to attend.</p>

	<p>"I'll go," said Passepartout to himself. He knew nothing of Mormonism except the custom of polygamy.</p>

	<p>The news spread through the train, which carried about one hundred passengers. Thirty came to car No. 117. Passepartout took one of the front seats.</p>

	<p>At the time Elder William Hitch rose, and, in an angry voice, told the passengers the history of the Mormon religion. The government had finally defeated these fanatics, and had put their leader, Brigham Young, in prison. Elder Hitch was trying to convert people on the very railway trains.</p>

	<p>The Elder's story became tiresome, and his audience grew smaller. This did not stop him, though, and he told about the Mormons being driven from Vermont, Ohio, and Missouri.</p>

	<p>Finally, only Passepartout was left. The Elder looked at him, and told him how Brigham Young had started Salt Lake City, and thanks to polygamy, it had become a great city.</p>

	<p>"And this," added Elder William Hitch, "this is why the Government wants to stop us! But we shall live somewhere. And you, my brother, will you not join us?"</p>

	<p>"No!" replied Passepartout courageously, and left the Elder alone.</p>

	<p>During the lecture the train had reached the Great Salt Lake, also called the Dead Sea. The Salt Lake, seventy miles long and thirty-five wide, has a lot of salt. Fishes, of course, cannot live in it. The country around the land was very nice, since the Mormons are mostly farmers.</p>

	<p>The train reached Ogden at two o'clock, where it rested for six hours. Mr Fogg and his party had time to visit Salt Lake City, and they spent two hours in this very American town. Like many other cities in this country, the town was made up of squares.</p>

	<p>The town did not have many people, except near the temples. There were many women, which was due to the strange practice of the Mormons. It is worth noting that it is mainly the women of Utah who are anxious to marry. These poor people did not seem happy. Some&#151;the more wealthy, no doubt&#151;wore short, open, black silk dresses, under a hood. Others wore clothes of an Indian fashion.</p>

	<p>Passepartout was a little frightened by these women, who in groups tried to please a single Mormon. His common sense pitied, above all, the husband. It seemed to him a terrible thing to have to help so many wives at once. He did not like this idea, and he imagined that the women of Salt Lake City looked closely at him. Happily, he only stayed in there a short time. At four the party returned to the train station and boarded the train. Just at the moment when the wheels began to move, cries of "Stop! Stop!" were heard.</p>

	<p>Trains stop for no one. The gentleman was a late Mormon. Happily for him, the station had no gates. He rushed along the track, jumped on the rear platform, and fell into a seat.</p>

	<p>Passepartout, who had been watching this gymnast, approached him and learned that he had run away from a problem at home.</p>

	<p>When the Mormon could breathe again, Passepartout politely asked him how many wives he had. After seeing him run, Passepartout thought he had twenty at least.</p>

	<p>"One, sir," replied the Mormon. "One, and that was enough!"</p>
