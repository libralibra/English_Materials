	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX</p>

	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">The Guests</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">S</span>eptember 23rd&#151;Our guests arrived about three weeks ago. Lord and Lady Lowborough have been married for eight months. Lord Lowborough looks surprisingly content with life, quite a change from before he was married. He does get upset, as do I, when Lady Lowborough and Arthur flirt with each other. We both suffer when we see such things, but my husband and his wife feel no shame. I grow quite angry and envious when she plays and sings, and my husband will stand next to her, watching attentively. Mr Hargrave is quite polite, particularly when he sees how upset I become at seeing my husband flirt so obviously with Lady Lowborough.</p>

	<p>28th&#151;Yesterday, we all went to the Grove, where Mr Hargrave's mother lives with his youngest sister, Esther. His mother often invites us for visits, but I seldom go. I don't like Mrs Hargrave. She has enough money to live comfortably, but must look as if she is far wealthier than she is. She thoroughly spoils her son, giving him anything he asks for, but has ignored the needs of Milicent and her younger sister, Esther. Much of their wealth has been wasted on Walter, and he has become quite selfish. She hopes to find wealthy husbands for her daughters, but seems more anxious to find her dear son a wife with a fortune that he can spend carelessly. Poor Milicent was forced to marry the wealthiest gentleman her mother could find, without a concern for Milicent's feelings. Her sister, Esther, is just fourteen, but her mother is already worried about finding her a wealthy husband. Esther is as honest and sweet as her sister, Milicent, but with a fearless spirit.</p>
