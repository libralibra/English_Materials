	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER THIRTEEN</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">W</span>hen Scarlett arrived in Atlanta, the first thing she did was to go to the Hamiltons' home to see if it was all right. During the attack on Atlanta, Aunt Pittypat and Uncle Peter had gone to Macon for a short time. But they had quickly returned to Atlanta when it was safe to do so. They welcomed Scarlett with many hugs and tears.</p>

	<p>Scarlett had some very strange ideas about how to make money. She had remembered that her dead husband, Charles Hamilton, had left her a little money in his will. He had made this will just before he left for the war, and he had given Scarlett everything he had! Scarlett had decided that if she had enough money, she would use it to buy a factory of some kind. She would find workers for her factory, and pay them as little money as possible. Any money that the factory made would be sent to Will at Tara. Will would use the money to feed the family, and buy pigs, chickens, crops and cotton to plant. When the factory had lots of customers, Scarlett would offer Ashley a job working for her. Then he and Melanie could move to Atlanta, and Will, Suellen and Carreen could stay at Tara.</p>

	<p>Scarlett thought this plan was perfect. She knew that no one in Atlanta would understand or agree with her plan, but she did not care. In those days, women did not own businesses, and they certainly did not own factories! However, all Scarlett cared about were two things: Tara, and Ashley. Even if the Northerners had taken everything else, Tara was hers&#151;it was in her blood. Keeping the fields of Tara alive and well meant more to Scarlett than anything else&#151;except Ashley. If Scarlett had a factory, she could send money to Will at Tara, and he could buy more cotton to plant. Ashley would have money, and something to do in Atlanta&#160;... and he would be near her. The thought of Ashley still made shivers run up and down Scarlett's back. She did not think for a moment that Ashley might want to do something else with his life.</p>

	<p>Scarlett decided that a lumber factory was the best kind to buy, because the people of Atlanta needed lumber to repair their damaged houses. She had found a small, dirty looking lumber factory for sale a few miles away from the Hamilton house. She spoke with the bank that had kept her money from Charles' will. Luckily, Charles had been smart enough to leave her the money in gold pieces. Gold was always valuable, but paper money was not. Unfortunately, Scarlett discovered that she did not have as much gold as she would need to buy this lumber factory. She would have to find a way to get more money, from someone&#160;... but how?</p>

	<p>A week after Scarlett arrived in Atlanta Aunt Pittypat heard some exciting gossip. "Scarlett, you'll never guess who's here again!" she said at dinner that evening.</p>

	<p>"Who, Aunt Pittypat?" asked Scarlett.</p>

	<p>"Rhett Butler! I wonder what that awful man has been doing. I heard that after the war, he went to Europe for a while. He is the only person I know who did not suffer in the war. Oh, that terrible man! I do hope he will not visit us here. Oh dear, what would people say? All my friends would be so angry with me!" And Aunt Pittypat left the dinner table worrying.</p>

	<p>When Scarlett heard Rhett's name, all her anger at him returned. She had not forgotten the night of her escape from Atlanta, and how Rhett had abandoned her in the road. Her green eyes flashed with fire. "That dirty, rotten, horrible rat&#160;... I hope he doesn't dare to even speak to me! I shall hate him forever for what he did!" she thought. She almost hoped she would see Rhett, so that she could have the pleasure of being angry and unkind to him.</p>

	<p>Suddenly, Scarlett had a thought that almost made her choke on her food. Rhett had money! He was the richest person she knew! If Scarlett could persuade Rhett to lend her the money to buy the factory, everything would be all right. But how could she do that?</p>

	<p>Scarlett decided that if Rhett wasn't in love with her, she would have to make him fall in love with her. "Then, he'll probably do anything I want," she thought. Scarlett was certain her plan would work, because she had always been able to have any boy she wanted! "Rhett won't be any different, because men are all alike," she said to herself. She smiled happily. This was going to be fun!</p>

	<p>Now all Scarlett had to do was to find Rhett, without letting Aunt Pittypat know what she was doing. She asked Aunt Pittypat's friends a few questions, and found out that Rhett was living in a hotel nearby. She was a little surprised that he had not been to visit her, but probably he didn't know she was in town. The next morning, Scarlett dressed in the green dress that she had made from the curtains at Tara. The green material was beautiful, and matched her eyes perfectly. As she looked in the mirror, Scarlett was glad that she was prettier than ever, and her figure was still slim. She was even a little thinner than before. The important thing was not to let Rhett see her hands! They were very rough and red from all the hard work at Tara, and the fingernails were broken. They were no longer the soft, white hands of a lady. Rhett could never know how hard she had been working. It just wouldn't be right.</p>

	<p>Scarlett arrived at the hotel where Rhett lived and was shown to his room. Her heart was pounding as she knocked on the door. She was strangely excited to see Rhett, even though she was still angry with him. At least, he was never boring!</p>

	<p>"Scarlett!" cried Rhett as he opened the door. "What a surprise to see you!</p>

	<p>Immediately Scarlett began her plan. "Oh, Rhett, thank God you're all right," she cried. She threw her arms around him and pretended that she was about to cry. "Where have you been? I was so afraid you would be hurt in the fighting, or even worse. Why haven't you been to see me?" she said.</p>

	<p>"Scarlett&#160;... I never thought you would be so worried about me," said Rhett. He looked very happy to see her, thought Scarlett. There was something about the look in his eyes that made Scarlett think, "He's in love with me already!"</p>

	<p>They sat down at the table. "Well, Rhett, tell me everything! Where have you been?" said Scarlett, smiling sweetly and looking as if she was extremely interested.</p>

	<p>Rhett told her all about his adventures. After the war, he had gone to New Orleans for a time, and then to Europe. Although she was thinking about how to ask Rhett for money, Scarlett could not help but be interested in his stories. Rhett was more interesting to talk to than almost anyone she knew. He could even make her laugh!</p>

	<p>Finally Rhett stopped talking and, looking at her closely, asked, "Now, Scarlett, how are you, and what have you been doing? How is everyone at Tara?"</p>

	<p>"Oh&#160;... everything is&#160;... just wonderful at Tara, Rhett. Everyone is happy and healthy, and we don't have any problems! Scarlett said slowly, hoping Rhett would believe her. "Oh, Rhett, that's why I came to see you. I just couldn't stand it, knowing that while I was at Tara, so happy and without a care in the world, you might be alone, sick, or hurt! I had to see if you were all right."</p>

	<p>Rhett looked amazed. "Why, Scarlett&#160;... can it be that you&#160;... you care about me? It seems that you have grown a heart, a real woman's heart!"</p>

	<p>Scarlett stared up into his eyes. "I have, Rhett, I know I have!"</p>

	<p>Before Scarlett had time to think, Rhett took one of her hands and put it to his face. What was he going to say? Suddenly he looked at the hand, and then at her. "Your hands! They're rough and red. These aren't the hands of a lady&#160;... you've been working like a slave! You lied to me. Why?"</p>

	<p>"Oh, no, Rhett, I went for a ride on my horse last week and fell off&#160;...&#160;"</p>

	<p>"Scarlett, stop inventing stories," Rhett said in a hard voice. "I only half-believed you when you said 'everything is just wonderful at Tara' anyway. Do you think I am a fool? Now, why are you really here? I know you better than you think. You must want something from me. What is it? Money?"</p>

	<p>Scarlett gave up her act. "All right, Rhett, I admit it! I need money to&#160;... to buy a factory. I want to run a factory and send the money to Tara to keep it running so that all the people there can eat. I know everyone in Atlanta will think it's awful but I don't give a damn! You don't know how horrible it's been, Rhett. The past year has been like a horrible dream. All the work and fear, the terrible fear of always going hungry! So finally I decided to come here and do whatever I had to do to get some money from you. You're the only man I know who can help me and please, Rhett, you've just got to give me the money!"</p>

	<p>Rhett looked amazed. In his own mind, he admired Scarlett's determination deeply. She was willing to do whatever it took to keep Tara, and her family, alive and well. "Who is living at Tara now, Scarlett?"</p>

	<p>"Too many people, Rhett! Will Benteen, who's been like a brother to me. He's helping me build Tara up again after all the Northerners destroyed it. Then there's Melanie and the baby, Beau, and Prissy, and Wade, and Mammy and Pork and Dilcey, and Suellen and Carreen&#160;... and Ashley."</p>

	<p>At the mention of Ashley Scarlett saw a strange, angry look in Rhett's eyes. "So! The honorable, elegant Ashley Wilkes has come back from the war alive, eh? What is he doing at Tara? Probably sitting around, trying to chop wood like a slave and dreaming of you. I wonder what Mrs Wilkes thinks? She's so good and wonderful that she can't imagine what the two of you are really thinking. Both of you make me sick. I am sure that your little plan to make money is intended to help him more than anyone else. Isn't it, Scarlett? Answer me!</p>

	<p>Scarlett was furious. How did Rhett know her so well? Still, her plan was not just to help Ashley! "Rhett Butler, you no good, dirty rat, how dare you say things like that to me!" she shouted. "You haven't got the smallest idea how terrible it's been at Tara! And there are so many people to feed&#160;... who cares if Ashley's one of them? Yes, if it makes you feel better, I do want to help Ashley. You couldn't possibly understand, you&#160;... you've never loved anyone. Oh, I could hit you!</p>

	<p>Rhett burst out laughing. "Save your hits, Scarlett. All right, I am sorry I made you so angry. I can see that saving Tara is truly important to you. And I truly admire your determination to own a factory in spite of what people will say. You are good at telling others what to do, I am sure."</p>

	<p>"Thank you," Scarlett said coldly.</p>

	<p>"However, none of my money is available at this time. It's all in gold, and it's in Europe. I couldn't give you any money, even if I wanted to&#151;which I don't," Rhett said cheerfully. "So, Scarlett, you'll just have to think of some other way to make money. I would gladly give money to help Tara, but I am sad to say that I will not give money to help Ashley Wilkes in any way. But I know you. You're smart. If any girl can find that money, you can!"</p>

	<p>"Rhett Butler, you let me talk on and on like that&#160;... you were never going to give me any money. I hope you die like the dog you are. Oh, I shall hate you until I die for this! Goodbye!" shouted Scarlett. And then Scarlett did try to hit Rhett, but he moved aside just in time, laughing. "Oh, Scarlett, don't hate me for that long, please. That would be terrible. Goodbye, my lady! Soon we shall meet again!"</p>

	<p>Scarlett walked out of the hotel room, slamming the door behind her.</p>
