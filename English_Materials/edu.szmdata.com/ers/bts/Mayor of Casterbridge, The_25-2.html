	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">O</span>n her way back home, Lucetta met Jopp in the street. He approached her and asked to speak with her a moment.</p>

	<p>"I was wondering if you might recommend me for the new position that has come available in your husband's company? It would mean a great deal to me."</p>

	<p>"But I don't even know you," Lucetta replied.</p>

	<p>"Ah! But I knew who you were back in Jersey. I'd say that you could tell your husband that I'm a very honest man."</p>

	<p>"I'm sorry, but I cannot," she answered and then walked away, leaving Jopp alone in the street.</p>

	<p>He returned to his own home very angry, and found Henchard coming down the stairs to meet him.</p>

	<p>"Jopp! How was your job hunt today?" he asked.</p>

	<p>"Ah! You know," Jopp said.</p>

	<p>"Yes, I do know. Anyway, I was wondering if you could deliver this package to Mrs Farfrae. I'd go myself, but I don't think I'd be very welcome there."</p>

	<p>Jopp took the package in his hands and promised to take it to the Farfrae's that night. Henchard then went to bed.</p>

	<p>Keeping his promise, Jopp left his home with the package under his arm. On his way to the Farfrae's home, he saw some of his friends at the bridge where the town failures met. They convinced him to join them at a nearby pub for a few drinks and some music.</p>

	<p>The pub they went to was the worst in town. Only the poorest and lowest of people went there. And all kinds of illegal activities happened there every night.</p>

	<p>"So what's in that package you got there?" someone asked Jopp. It was the old woman that had told about Henchard's past in court.</p>

	<p>"Well&#160;... considering who gave it to me and who I'm supposed to be taking it to, I'm guessing that it's a big secret. Something between lovers." Jopp said.</p>

	<p>"Goodness me! Well then open that package up and let sail take a look at this secret!"</p>

	<p>Jopp immediately opened it and emptied the pile of letters onto the table before him.</p>

	<p>"Letters! Love letters! Read them to us, Jopp!" the woman cried.</p>

	<p>He read several and then told everyone who had written them.</p>

	<p>"Mrs Farfrae?" they cried out in surprise. "So she can write such things to a man and then marry another? It sounds to me like we need to teach her a lesson. You know, give her the old 'skimmity-ride'!"</p>

	<p>Just then, a man who had been sitting nearby turned around to them and asked what they meant by "skimmity-ride". He was a stranger in town and he was not familiar with such a word.</p>

	<p>"It's what we do to women when we find out they're not being honest to their husbands! It's quite funny, actually," Jopp's friend explained.</p>

	<p>"Well, I'd love to see that!" the stranger said excitedly. Then, reaching into his pockets, he pulled out a coin and threw it onto the table in front of Jopp. "Now, I'll only be here a couple of weeks. I hope to see this 'skimmity-ride' before I go." Then the man left to find a place to stay for the night.</p>

	<p>The next morning, Jopp took Henchard's package to the Farfrae's. Lucetta then immediately burned the letters and felt an enormous relief at having gotten rid of her past.</p>
