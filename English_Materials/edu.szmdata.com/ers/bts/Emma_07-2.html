	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER SEVEN</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">O</span>nce the portrait was complete, Emma requested that Mr Elton go to London to choose a frame. Mr Elton was delighted to go, more excited about the journey than Emma expected. The morning he left for London, Harriet was at Hartfield to visit Emma. Soon after breakfast, she returned home, but returned for dinner. She arrived at the Woodhouses much earlier than expected. As soon as she arrived, she announced that Mr Martin's sister had delivered a letter to her.</p>

	<p>The letter was from Mr Martin himself, and was a marriage proposal. Harriet thought it was a well-written letter, and came for advice from Miss Woodhouse. Emma was a bit ashamed that Harriet was so pleased to receive a marriage proposal from a farmer.</p>

	<p>"Will you read the letter?" cried Harriet.</p>

	<p>Emma read the letter, and was surprised at how well-written the letter was, written by a farmer. The words were strong and direct, as if he loved her very much.</p>

	<p>Harriet was anxiously watching Emma read the letter, "Well, well, is it a good letter, or too short?" was Harriet's first question.</p>

	<p>"Yes, a very good letter; I think his sister helped him write it. I doubt Mr Martin, a farmer, could write this well."</p>

	<p>"Well," asked Harriet, "what should I do?"</p>

	<p>"You should answer the letter quickly, although, his feelings will be hurt, so be careful of what you say," was Emma's response.</p>

	<p>"You think I should refuse his marriage proposal?" Harriet asked.</p>

	<p>"Of course. Are you still not sure about what your answer should be?"</p>

	<p>"No, I will refuse his proposal, but I didn't realize he liked me so very much," Harriet responded, looking disappointed.</p>

	<p>"I believe, Harriet, that if you have doubts about this marriage, then you should refuse," Emma advised her friend, seeing the disappointment on Harriet's face.</p>

	<p>"You think I should refuse the offer, then?" asked Harriet.</p>

	<p>"Harriet, you must make your own decisions, I won't advise you on this matter, but if you prefer Mr Martin over every other man, then you should marry him," Emma paused to look at Harriet, "are you thinking of someone else you would prefer over Mr Martin? Mr Elton, perhaps?"</p>

	<p>"Alright, I must refuse Mr Martin; do you think I am right?"</p>

	<p>"Perfectly, perfectly right, Harriet! I completely approve your decision. If you had married Mr Martin, I would never be able to see you. I have no farmer friends; therefore, I would never go to his farm to visit you."</p>

	<p>"You could not have visited me!" Harriet cried, "I never thought of that, I would be so upset if I could not see you."</p>

	<p>Soon after, Emma helped Harriet write a short letter to Mr Martin, refusing his marriage proposal. The rest of the evening, Harriet was feeling rather sad.</p>

	<p>"I shall never be invited to the Martin home again," she repeated several times.</p>

	<p>"I would be so upset if you married Mr Martin, I would never be able to visit you," responded Emma.</p>

	<p>"Now he has my letter, I hope he will not be too unhappy."</p>
