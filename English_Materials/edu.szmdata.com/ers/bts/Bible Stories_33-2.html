	<p class="storyTitle">33. Moses' Failure and Last Speech</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">A</span>fter many days in the desert, the people again ran out of water. As they always did, they went to Moses for help.</p>

	<p>"You have brought us out of Egypt to this evil place," they cried. "Now we will die because there is no water."</p>

	<p>God told Moses to take his rod and go to a nearby rock.</p>

	<p>"Speak to the rock so they can all hear you," he said. "Water will come out of the rock so everyone can get a drink."</p>

	<p>Moses went up to the rock, but instead of speaking to it, he took his rod and hit it twice.</p>

	<p>"Listen, you rebels," he shouted. "Must I always get your water for you!"</p>

	<p>Water poured from the rock as God said it would. God spoke to Moses and Aaron: "I asked you to speak to the rock, but you hit it. If you cannot obey me in front of my people, you will not lead them to the Promised Land."</p>

	<p>Then God told Moses to take Aaron and his son Eleazar to the top of Mount Hor. There Aaron died, and his son took his place as priest. All the people were sad at Aaron's death and mourned him for 30 days.</p>

	<p>After defeating the people of Midian, Moses described to the people how they were to divide the land of Canaan among the tribes. They were also to establish six special cities called cities of refuge and cities of safety. A person who killed another accidently could go to a city of safety. There they would be protected from anyone seeking revenge for the killing. Murderers would not be allowed inside a city of safety because they would have broken one of God's Ten Commandments.</p>

	<p>It was time for the people to cross over the Jordan River into the Promised Land. Because Moses had disobeyed God by hitting at the rock with his stick, he would not be making the last part of the journey with his people.</p>

	<p>Moses gathered the people of Israel together one last time. He repeated the Ten Commandments to them. Moses also reminded the people of all God had done for them over this long journey.</p>

	<p>Then God spoke to Moses. "Although you will never go into the land, you will see it before you die," God said. "Climb to the top of Mount Pisgah, and there you will see the Promised Land before you die."</p>

	<p>Moses did as God had told him. He told the people to welcome Joshua as their new leader. Then he went up on the mountain where he died. The people of Israel cried and mourned for Moses for thirty days after he died. He was the greatest leader in Israel's history.</p>
