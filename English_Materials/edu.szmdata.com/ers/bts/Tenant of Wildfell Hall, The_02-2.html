	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">An Interview</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">A</span>nd now, I will continue with my story. I think the last day I mentioned was a Sunday, the last in October of 1827. On the following Tuesday, I was out hunting with my dog. I walked farther into the woods, and finally saw Wildfell Hall in the distance, looking quite old and worn. The mansion had been abandoned for quite some time. While I stood looking at the place, I heard and saw a small child playing in the garden, a young boy of about five years old.</p>

	<p>The child did not notice me, but looked with excitement at my dog, Sancho. The child then began climbing the garden wall to come closer to the dog. His foot slipped, and down he fell, but I caught him before he fell to the ground. The boy's mother quickly ran over and took him in her arms, looking anxiously at me as she did.</p>

	<p>"Give me the child!" she said.</p>

	<p>"I was not harming the child, Madam," said I. "He was falling off the wall, and I caught him before he fell to the ground."</p>

	<p>"Excuse me, sir," she said, as she realized what happened, "I did not know you&#151;and I thought&#151;" She kissed his forehead, embarrassed.</p>

	<p>"I did not know he had attempted to climb the wall.&#151;You are Mr Markham, I believe?" she asked quickly. "Your sister came for a visit a few days ago, with Mrs Markham. Goodbye Mr Markham," she said as she turned around to leave.</p>
