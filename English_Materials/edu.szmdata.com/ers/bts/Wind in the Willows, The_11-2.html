	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER ELEVEN</p>

	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">Toad Learns a Lesson</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">A</span>fter all the weasels had run away, Badger said, "All right, Toad. We've gotten your house back for you. Now we're hungry. Why don't you go and find us something to eat?"</p>

	<p>Toad was a little annoyed at this. Why didn't Badger tell him how brave and strong he was? He had attacked the leader of the weasels! However, Toad was hungry too. So he went into the kitchen and tried to find something for them to eat. Fortunately the weasels had left a lot of food. There was a cold chicken, and some bread and cheese. Badger, Toad, and Rat were just about to sit down to eat when the kitchen door opened. Mole ran into the room. "I found some little weasels hiding in the house. They were very, very afraid of us. I didn't want to hurt them, but I made them go upstairs and clean the bedrooms. Now, we've all got nice, clean beds to sleep in tonight!"</p>

	<p>"That is excellent, Mole!" cried the Badger. "I knew I could trust you to do the intelligent thing!"</p>

	<p>Toad envied Mole a little. Badger wasn't saying such nice things to him! But then Toad realized that Mole, and all his other friends, were working hard for him. They cared about him, and they wanted him to have his house back. Toad did not feel envious anymore. He said, "Thank you, dear Mole, and Badger and Rat. Thank you for all your trouble and hard work tonight!" The Badger was very pleased. He said, "There spoke my brave Toad!"</p>

	<p>After eating all the animals went to bed, because they were very tired. The next morning Toad woke up very late. When he went down to the kitchen, he saw that everyone else had already eaten. Mole and Rat were sitting outside in the warm sunshine. They were laughing and telling stories. Badger was sitting in the kitchen reading. "Toad," he said, "there is a lot of work for you to do today. Since we have won the fight against the weasels, we must have a celebration. You must send invitations to all our friends. It is the custom, you know."</p>

	<p>Toad didn't want to do any work. He said, "Badger, how can you expect me to work on a day like this? I'm going to walk around my property, and make sure all my servants are all right. I'm not going to stay inside and write a lot of letters!" But then Toad saw how Badger was looking at him. He said quickly, "Well, all right, Badger! I'll stay inside and write letters. I'll do anything for my friends. That's what I always say!"</p>

	<p>So Toad stayed inside all morning. He wrote letters to all the animals in the neighborhood. While he was writing, he had an idea for the party. He would give speeches and sing songs! Toad always enjoyed himself at his parties. Everyone paid attention to him. So Toad wrote a plan for the party. There would be speeches and songs, all by him.</p>

	<p>When Rat and Mole returned to Toad Hall that afternoon, Toad was in a very good mood. His friends were surprised. They thought Toad would be in a bad mood, because he had had to work all day. Badger said, "Well, Toad, have you written the letters? I just ordered all the food for the party."</p>

	<p>"Yes, I sent the invitations today. Now, here is the plan for the party! "said Toad. He gave them the piece of paper with the program on it. The other three animals read it. Then Rat looked at Toad sadly. "Toad, you must understand something. At this party, you will not give any speeches, and you will not sing songs. You know that your songs are only about how great you are. When you give a speech, it is to praise yourself. Please understand that we don't want that. Everyone will laugh at you. We're not asking you, we're just telling you." The Rat felt terrible about saying these things to his friend. But he needed to tell Toad the truth.</p>

	<p>Toad said sadly, "Oh, Rat! Couldn't I sing just one little song? I love to sing, and give speeches!" "No, not even one," said Rat. "This hurts me to say more than it hurts you to hear, Toad."</p>

	<p>Toad sat there for a long time. His head was down. His friends looked at him quietly. When he looked at them, he looked like a different Toad. "My friends," he said very sadly, "you are right, and I am wrong. I wanted everyone to pay attention to me, one last time. But I know that my talking and singing would embarrass you. So from now on, I will be a very different Toad. Oh, this is very a hard world!" Then Toad slowly walked out of the room.</p>

	<p>Rat said, "Badger, I feel terrible. How do you feel?"</p>

	<p>"I feel terrible, too," said Badger. "But you did the right thing, Rat. Toad must change his ways. We are his friends, and we want him to lead a good life. We want the other animals to respect him."</p>

	<p>The next day was the party. Toad sat in his room. He was thinking about everything that had happened. At first he was sad, but soon he began to smile and feel better. Then he had another idea. He jumped up and loudly sang a song about himself. He pretended there were other animals in the room watching him. After he finished singing, he felt a lot better.</p>

	<p>When the party began, Toad walked quietly down the stairs. All his friends were waiting for him. There were many guests at the party. Everyone went to greet Toad. They were surprised to see that he was so quiet. Some of the animals said things like, "There's our brave Toad! Toad, you must tell us the whole story!" When Otter saw Toad, he shouted happily, "There's the fighter!" But Toad only said, "No, no, I didn't do anything. It was Badger, Rat, and Mole who did all of the fighting. Let them tell the whole story."</p>

	<p>Toad's friends were amazed. Badger and Rat couldn't stop staring at Toad. It seemed that he had really changed! For the rest of the night, Toad was very quiet and calm. He asked all the guests about their families. Soon it was time to eat dinner. There was a lot of food, and it was very delicious. After the dinner some of the animals said, "Toad, we want to hear a song or a speech!" But Toad just shook his head. "No, my friends, I don't want to sing, or make a speech. I'm just happy to have you all here." Toad saw how astonished Badger, Mole, and Rat were. This made him happy.</p>

	<p>After all these adventures, the four animals lived very happily. They did many things together. After talking with his friends, Toad sent a gift to the girl who had helped him escape from the jail. He gave her a beautiful golden necklace. Toad also sent some money to the woman whose horse he had stolen. He wrote both of these women very nice letters.</p>

	<p>Often the four friends would walk through the Wild Forest together. Now the Wild Forest was very safe. When the weasels saw them pass by, they would say to their children, "Look! There go four brave fighters." Sometimes when the weasel children were bad, their mothers would say, "If you're not good, the terrible gray Badger and his friends will come and get you!" When Mole, Rat, Toad, and Badger heard about this, they thought it was very funny. They all liked children. However, the little weasels believed their mothers. It was some time before they discovered that Badger and his friends were very nice animals, after all.</p>
