	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">A</span> week had not passed since Miss Hawkins' name was mentioned in Highbury. When Mr Elton arrived, most people in town already knew her history and appearance. He returned, a very happy man. He left Highbury rejected and hurt, but came back satisfied with himself. He no longer cared for Miss Woodhouse, and ignored Miss Smith.</p>

	<p>Miss Augusta Hawkins was charming and beautiful, and had a fortune of ten thousand pounds. They fell in love immediately after meeting, and were soon engaged. He returned to Highbury a confident man, speaking of his wedding plans often. The wedding was to be soon, and he announced that on his next return to Highbury, he would bring his future bride. Emma was happy for the new couple, but it pained her to see him. She assumed that after the marriage, she would rarely see Mr Elton, which satisfied her.</p>

	<p>Emma thought little of Miss Hawkins. She was good enough for Mr Elton, but was plain compared to Harriet's beauty and her family was not of high society. Aside from her fortune of ten thousand pounds, she was not better than Harriet.</p>

	<p>Emma still felt quite guilty about Harriet's broken heart. She had talked Harriet into love, but could not talk her out of it. She feared that nothing could calm Harriet's mind, she would forever be in love with Mr Elton. Since his arrival, Harriet had become more upset with the situation. Emma saw Mr Elton only once, but everyday Harriet would hear his voice or see him pass by or hear his name in a conversation, there was always a reminder of his presence.</p>

	<p>A few days after Harriet spoke with the Martins, Elizabeth Martin requested that Harriet come for a visit. Emma thought a visit to the Martins' farm would be respectful to the family, although the visit should be quite short. Emma took her there in her carriage, and would return for her soon. Emma feared that Harriet would again fall in love with Mr Martin during this meeting.</p>

	<p>"This cannot be allowed, Harriet is not to be a farmer's wife," Emma thought to herself.</p>
