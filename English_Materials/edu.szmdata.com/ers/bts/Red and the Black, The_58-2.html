	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT</p>

	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">The Tiger</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">F</span>or the first time ever, Mathilde felt what it is to love.</p>

	<p>She discovered she was pregnant. "Will you still have doubts?" she said. "Isn't this a promise? I'm your wife forever."</p>

	<p>This astonished Julien. He almost forgot his plan. How can I be so cold to this woman who is ruining herself for me? He thought.</p>

	<p>"I want to write to my father," Mathilde said. "He's also my friend, and I don't want us to lie to him."</p>

	<p>"My God! What are you going to do?" he cried.</p>

	<p>"My duty," Mathilde replied, her eyes filled with joy.</p>

	<p>"But he'll throw me out!"</p>

	<p>"He has that right. If he throws you out, I'll go with you."</p>

	<p>The astonished Julien begged her to wait a week. She refused, so he said, "All right, then! I order you to wait. Your honor is safe with me. Just imagine your father's sorrow."</p>

	<p>"Do you mean," she said, "imagine his desire for revenge?"</p>

	<p>"I am upset about hurting your father, but I do not and will not fear anyone."</p>

	<p>The next week Marquis de la Mole read the letter.</p>

	<blockquote class="letter">

	<p>Dear Papa,</p>

	<p>All social ties are finished. Now we only have ties of family. I have a husband now. If you can give us some money, I will move far away. No one will know my husband's name, Mr Sorel.</p>

	<p>I was the first to love. I seduced him. There is no finer man, and I will go with him.</p>

	</blockquote>

	<p>A servant came to get Julien. "The marquis wants to see you now."</p>
