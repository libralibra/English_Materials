	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER THIRTY-THREE</p>

	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">A Prison</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">T</span>he police moved Julien to another prison in Besan&#xE7;on.</p>

	<p>Father Ch&#xE9;lan came to visit Julien. "Oh, God! Is this possible, my child? Monster, I should say!" The kind old man could not talk any more. Julien saw his old teacher openly weep. For the first time, Julien thought about killing himself. He wanted to be brave, though; he wanted to die without fear.</p>

	<p>Fouqu&#x00E9; also came to visit him. Julien's friend was full of sorrow, and he kept talking about an escape. Fouqu&#x00E9;'s plan was to sell all his land to help Julien. This man would sacrifice everything, Julien thought. What man from Paris would do this?</p>

	<p>Fouqu&#xE9; sold wood to many people. One person was Vicar-general de Frilair. Fouqu&#x00E9; bowed before the priest and begged him to help Julien. Mr de Frilair was surprised by Julien's actions. Maybe I can benefit from this, the priest thought. Perhaps I can use him to make friends with Marquis de la Mole, who likes this little student.</p>
