	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">Phineas Fogg Astonishes Passepartout, His Servant</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">A</span>fter winning forty pounds at whist, Phineas Fogg left the club at twenty-five minutes past seven. Passepartout, who had studied his duties, was surprised to see his master at this early hour.</p>

	<p>Mr Fogg went to his bedroom, and called Passepartout. There was no answer, so he called again. Passepartout appeared.</p>

	<p>"I've called you twice," observed his master.</p>

	<p>"But it's not midnight," replied the other.</p>

	<p>"I know; I don't blame you. We start for Dover and Calais in ten minutes."</p>

	<p>"Monsieur is going to leave home?"</p>

	<p>"Yes," replied Phineas Fogg. "We are going around the world."</p>

	<p>Passepartout was astonished. "Round the world!" he said quietly.</p>

	<p>"In eighty days," said Mr Fogg. "So we haven't a moment to lose. We'll only take a bag with some clothes. We'll buy clothes on our way. Bring me my raincoat and some good shoes."</p>

	<p>Passepartout tried to reply, but couldn't. He made the preparations. Around the world in eighty days! Was his master a fool? No. Was this a joke? They were going to Calais; good! Passepartout had not returned to France for five years. He would be happy to see it again.</p>

	<p>At eight o'clock Passepartout had packed the bag. Mr Fogg was ready. Under his arm he had a copy of Bradshaw's Continental Railway Steam Transit and General Guide, which had timetables of steamers and railways.</p>

	<p>"Have you forgotten anything?" he asked.</p>

	<p>"Nothing, monsieur."</p>

	<p>"Good! Take this bag. Take good care of it, for there are twenty thousand pounds in it."</p>

	<p>They took a cab to the railway station. Before they entered the station, a beggar woman with a child approached and asked for some money.</p>

	<p>Mr Fogg took the forty pounds he had won at whist, and gave them to the beggar. "Here, my good woman. I'm glad I met you."</p>

	<p>Passepartout was touched by his master's action.</p>

	<p>Two first-class tickets were bought. The five friends were there to say goodbye. "Well, gentlemen," Mr Fogg said, "I will return in less than eighty days."</p>

	<p>The night was dark, and Passepartout was still astonished. Suddenly he cried out.</p>

	<p>"What's the matter?" asked Mr Fogg.</p>

	<p>"In my hurry, I forgot to turn off the gas in my room!"</p>

	<p>"Very well. It will burn at your expense."</p>
