	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER TWELVE</p>

	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">A Journey</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">J</span>ulien prepared to leave the next morning. Mrs de R&#x00EA;nal came outside to see him, but he was surprised by her cold manner. He thought she wanted to remind him of his low position in society, and this hurt his pride.</p>

	<p>The pain and anger that came to Julien's face made Mrs de R&#x00EA;nal want to cry, and she soon went to bed.</p>

	<p>While Mrs de R&#x00EA;nal wept, Julien enjoyed the countryside. Far away from any people Julien felt free. After some time he came to the valley where his friend Fouqu&#xE9;, the wood merchant, lived alone. Even with his friend Fouqu&#x00E9; he would hide his true feelings.</p>

	<p>Julien told Fouqu&#xE9; some of what had happened. "You can stay here with me and be my partner," Fouqu&#x00E9; suggested. "We can make a lot of money selling wood."</p>

	<p>This offer did not make Julien happy. He could take the money and later he could become a priest or soldier. The money would help him if he had troubles. "But if I work here I'll lose seven or eight years of my youth," he thought. By the age of twenty-eight Napoleon had done many great things. Could he still do great things if he started so late?</p>

	<p>Julien refused Fouqu&#xE9;'s offer, and Fouqu&#xE9; was confused. "I'll make you a partner! Why do you still want to return? Mr de R&#x00EA;nal hates you!" he said. Still Julien refused.</p>

	<p>Julien left Fouqu&#xE9;'s house and traveled through the mountains. He was not peaceful now, though. Fouqu&#x00E9;'s offer had troubled him; he had to choose between an easy life and his heroic dream. These troubles made Julien doubt his ability to be a great man.</p>
