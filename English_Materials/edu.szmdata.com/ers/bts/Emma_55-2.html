	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER FIFTY-FIVE</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">H</span>arriet soon returned from London with the Knightleys. She was, at first, anxious and embarrassed. After she and Emma spoke for some time, she no longer felt foolish, and was excited to tell Emma the details of Mr Martin's proposal. She told Emma that she had always been in love with Robert Martin.</p>

	<p>Soon, it became known that Harriet's father was a tradesman, rich enough to afford his daughter a comfortable life. Emma knew Harriet was of high society! Emma had no doubt of Harriet's happiness. Harriet immediately began making wedding arrangements, and much less often visited Hartfield. Within the next three months, by the end of September, Emma attended Harriet's wedding. Mr Elton was present to marry the happy couple. Harriet was very much in love with Robert Martin, and had forgotten about Mr Elton completely. At the wedding, Mr Elton was simply the clergyman.</p>

	<p>Jane Fairfax had already left Highbury, and was again with the Campbells. She and Frank Churchill would wait till November to marry.</p>

	<p>Emma and Mr Knightly decided they must marry while John and Isabella were still in Highbury. However, Mr Woodhouse became quite upset when the wedding was spoken of. After some time, he did accept the idea, and soon, the wedding date was decided. Emma Woodhouse married George Knightley one month after Harriet's wedding. The wedding was quite ordinary, and Mrs Elton thought her wedding was far better. Yet, the dear friends of Emma and Mr Knightley wished them happiness.</p>
