	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER FOURTEEN</p>

	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">Capture!</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">D'</span>Artagnan did not reach home again until after three in the morning. Inside, on the table in his room, he found a letter from Constance. He opened it excitedly and read:</p>

	<blockquote class="letter">

	<p>I must thank you for all your help&#151;from myself and the Queen. Come to the pavilion behind the church this evening at about ten o'clock.</p>

	</blockquote>

	<p>D'Artagnan's young heart filled with excitement. He walked around the room unable to sleep, but eventually he lay down and fell into sweet dreams.</p>

	<p>Later that morning d'Artagnan went off to the Musketeer's station to see Mister Treville. The captain was in a good mood. He was pleased that the King and Queen were so happy at the party&#151;and was even more pleased that the Cardinal looked so angry.</p>

	<p>When he saw d'Artagnan his happy face changed. "Sit down, my young friend," he said. "We must talk about serious business. Your actions have saved the Queen, and caused the Cardinal's plans to fail. You must be very careful now."</p>

	<p>"Why should I be careful, what do I have to fear?" d'Artagnan asked with his head high.</p>

	<p>"You have much to fear, young man, believe me. The Cardinal does not forget his enemies, and you are now one of his most troublesome enemies. I believe that the Cardinal will try to hurt you; and he may hurt you in some way that you do not expect."</p>

	<p>"The terrible devil!" said d'Artagnan. "What should I do?"</p>

	<p>"You must always be careful and see that there are many enemies all around you. You cannot trust anybody&#151;not your friends, your family, or even your love. Do you have a love, d'Artagnan?"</p>

	<p>D'Artagnan's face turned red. Treville nodded his head in understanding. "Be careful about your love. The Cardinal may try to hurt you through a woman," he said seriously. "Be careful, young d'Artagnan, I say it again! You are the enemy of the most powerful man in France."</p>

	<p>D'Artagnan left the Musketeer station and went to see Athos, Porthos, and Aramis. He heard about each of their journeys, fights and their return to Paris.</p>

	<p>At nine o'clock that night d'Artagnan left for the church and soon arrived in front of the pavilion. It was in the church garden in a quiet spot.</p>

	<p>D'Artagnan sat against a tree and waited. A few minutes later the church bells rang ten times. D'Artagnan did not move, he just watched the pavilion closely. All the pavilion's windows were closed except a small one on the first floor.</p>

	<p>The church clock hit half past ten. D'Artagnan felt his body become cold, but it was a warm night and he did not know why. He began walking up and down, and became more and more worried about the quiet.</p>

	<p>Finally eleven o'clock came and d'Artagnan became very afraid that something terrible had happened to Constance.</p>

	<p>He decided to look into the pavilion. He climbed in through the window and walked up to the second floor.</p>

	<p>On the second floor one of the windows was broken in and the door was broken also. A table and many chairs were turned over and d'Artagnan could tell that there had been a violent fight.</p>

	<p>D'Artagnan climbed back out of the window and ran quickly down to the street. His heart was moving fast, but his mind was clear. He saw things that he had not seen while coming to the church. The ground was covered with the footsteps of horses and the wheels of a carriage had made small holes in the soft ground.</p>

	<p>A few minutes later, he was riding his horse fast towards Paris.</p>

	<p>It was not until six in the morning that d'Artagnan arrived back at his house. Mister Bonacieux was waiting at his door.</p>

	<p>"Hello, young man," he began. "It seems that you have a very happy night. It is six in the morning and you are just coming home, eh. What fun did you have last night? Just look at your shoes!"</p>

	<p>D'Artagnan looked down and saw that his boots were all covered with mud. He noticed that Bonacieux's shoes were also muddy. He suddenly realized that Bonacieux must have found a way to read the note that his niece had sent to d'Artagnan and had told the Cardinal!</p>

	<p>D'Artagnan wanted to pull his sword out right then and kill him, but he pretended to be happy and smiled. "Last night I went to a party with many friends, a very merry one indeed," he said, "I will go and make Planchet clean my shoes. When he is finished, I will, if you wish, send him down to clean your shoes also."</p>

	<p>D'Artagnan thought that Bonacieux might know where his niece was and that he might be able to make him tell. He decided to first go and talk with his three friends and plan a way to rescue Constance.</p>
