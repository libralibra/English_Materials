	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER THIRTY-SIX</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">"I</span> hope I shall soon introduce my son to you," Mr Weston said to Mrs Elton.</p>

	<p>"Oh, yes, I shall be very happy to meet him. I have heard that his home is quite far from Highbury. But, I suppose, to wealthy families, the long distance is not a concern. My brother-in-law, Mr Suckling travels often, being so wealthy himself."</p>

	<p>"The problem for my son is not the distance, but his aunt, Mrs Churchill. She is very fond of Frank, but her illnesses are the most serious when Frank is planning to travel. They will be coming to London soon; Mrs Churchill has decided that her home is too cold. Frank will be much closer to Highbury, and therefore, able to visit more often."</p>

	<p>"Have you told Mr Churchill there is a new addition to Highbury?" Mrs Elton asked, meaning the "new addition" to be herself.</p>

	<p>"Oh, of course, I have told him in every letter written to him recently about the lovely Mrs Elton."</p>

	<p>Mrs Elton was pleased with the compliment, which she had been waiting for during the conversation with Mr Weston.</p>
