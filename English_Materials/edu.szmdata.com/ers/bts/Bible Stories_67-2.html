	<p class="storyTitle">67. A Big Catch</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">A</span>fter these things, the disciples once went out on their boat and fished through the night without catching a thing. The next morning they started back for the shore.</p>

	<p>"Catch anything?" a man yelled to them from the land. They yelled back that they hadn't caught any fish.</p>

	<p>"Throw your net over the right side of the boat," the man told them. When they did, the net filled up with so many fish, it could barely hold them all.</p>

	<p>"It's Jesus!" John shouted. Then Peter jumped over the side of the boat and waded to shore.</p>

	<p>By the time the other disciples arrived, Jesus had started a fire.</p>

	<p>"Bring me the fish you caught," he said.</p>

	<p>After they ate, Jesus took Peter away from the group. He asked Peter if he loved him three times, and Peter said he did. "Then feed my sheep for me when I'm gone," he said. Peter knew Jesus meant for him to keep on teaching the lessons Jesus had taught all his followers.</p>
