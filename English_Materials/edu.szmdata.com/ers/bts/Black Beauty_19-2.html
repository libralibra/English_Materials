	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER NINETEEN</p>

	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">My Fate</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">I</span>t was a pitiful horse sale. I had never seen so many horses in terrible condition. And the people there to buy were not much better off than the horses themselves. I was glad that I was not sent to the factory to be killed, for I was still in pretty good condition, but there were some horses there that it would have been better to kill.</p>

	<p>But occasionally a handsome looking horse would be led past my stall, and there were also some kind-looking buyers. One very nice old man seemed really interested in me, but I was not strong enough for the work he needed done.</p>

	<p>I had been at the sale for quite a while, when I then saw a man and a boy come walking out of the area where the best horses were being sold. The man had a very strong body, but a gentle face. He looked to be a wealthy farmer.</p>

	<p>As he walked along my row of horses, he stopped at my stall and looked at me with pity. I lifted my head and looked back at him.</p>

	<p>"Now look here, Willie," he said to the boy. "This is an example of great horse that has been treated very poorly."</p>

	<p>"What do you think they used him for, grandpa? A carriage puller?" Asked the boy.</p>

	<p>"You're right, boy. He sure is a handsome fellow, even with those marks on his knees. He must have had some very fine parents."</p>

	<p>The boy touched my nose. "Let's buy him and try to make him as healthy as he once was. You know, like we did with that other horse, Ladybird."</p>

	<p>"This one might be too old for that, boy."</p>

	<p>"I don't think so, grandpa. He still looks to have many years ahead of him."</p>

	<p>"The boy seems to have a good eye for horses, sir," said the agent who was selling me. "It's true, he has worked too hard as a carriage horse, but he was just recently examined by a doctor. It was his opinion that this horse would be in excellent shape again, after six months of proper care and rest. Now, I've only known this horse for ten days, but I can tell you, I've never seen a sweeter, kinder horse than him. I'll offer him to you for five pounds, sir. And I think that's a very fair price, for in six months he'll be worth ten times that amount."</p>

	<p>"The horse we just sold, brought in five more pounds than we had expected! Come on, grandpa, we won't lose anything by getting him," said the boy to the old man.</p>

	<p>The farmer, after looking me over carefully, guessed my age to be around thirteen or fourteen. Then he asked the agent to take me out of the stall for a better look.</p>

	<p>"Now, how much do you want for him?" He asked my agent.</p>

	<p>"Just five pounds, sir," he replied.</p>

	<p>"OK, we'll take him."</p>

	<p>I was then taken to a hotel by a servant and given some food before being ridden to my new home.</p>

	<p>My new owner, Mr Thoroughgood, told the stable workers that I was to be given fresh hay and oats, twice each day, and that I was to be allowed to run in the field until evening.</p>

	<p>"Now, Willie. Since you are the one who believed in this horse so much, I'm going to put you in charge of caring for him. Make sure he gets everything he needs," he said to his grandson.</p>

	<p>And he did just as his grandfather had told him. Every day, Willie would give me more attention than he gave the other horses. He cared about me a great deal, and he would often bring his grandfather in to get his opinion on how good a job he had done. After checking my legs, the man would say, "He's getting healthier by the day, boy. You're doing a wonderful job. In just a few more months he'll be able to start working again, and then we can find him a new home."</p>

	<p>After four more months had passed, I was, one day, specially groomed. The workers cut my hair and made it look nice and shiny. I do not think I had ever looked so handsome in all my life. I knew that someone very important was going to be looking at me that day.</p>

	<p>They then harnessed me to a carriage and drove me two or three miles to Mr Thoroughgood's beautiful home.</p>

	<p>Once we arrived, the old man left the carriage and went into his home, while Willie waited with me outside. Moments later, he reappeared with three women. One of the women looked old and weak. She was assisted by a much younger and happier-looking lady, with dark eyes. The third woman seemed very strong and healthy.</p>

	<p>"You say he's fallen before," said the older lady, "I would be very unhappy if he were to fall again."</p>

	<p>"I understand, ma'am, however, most horses suffer these kinds of injuries in their lives and still go on to be wonderful workers," replied Mr Thoroughgood. "How do you feel about him,Ms. Blomefeld?"</p>

	<p>"Well, Mr Thoroughgood, I trust your judgment. We'll keep him for a week and see how he does with our driver. He'll come to get the horse tomorrow."</p>

	<p>When the driver arrived the next day, he looked me over carefully. Seeing the marks on my legs he became disappointed and said to Mr Thoroughgood, "I'm surprised that you should recommend such a horse to the ladies, sir."</p>

	<p>"Just try him for the week. If you're unsatisfied, we'll happily take him back," replied the old man. So, I was taken to the ladies' stables. The following morning, when the groom came to brush me, he noticed the white hair on my forehead and said, "Hmm, this mark reminds me of a horse I'd taken care of in the past." and then when he saw the white hair on my foot his eyes widened with joy.</p>

	<p>"Black Beauty! It's you!" He yelled as he put his arms around my neck. "Surely you remember me. I'm Little Joe Green, who nearly killed you by not giving you a blanket and warm water that night you saved Mrs Gordon."</p>

	<p>I was so happy to see him again, and I tried to show this by putting my nose on his face.</p>

	<p>Later that same day, I was harnessed to a small carriage and driven to the front of the ladies' house. Then the young, dark-eyed lady came out of the front door and down to me. Joe helped her into the driver's seat and after several minutes of riding around she said, "Well, I feel pretty safe with him so far. I bet he's a good horse, after all."</p>

	<p>"You're right, Miss Ellen," Joe replied. "I know this horse very well, actually. He used to be Squire Gordon's."</p>

	<p>"Well, then I'll have to write a letter to the Gordons, telling them that their beloved horse is now under our care," the lady said. "They'll certainly be happy to hear that."</p>

	<p>And for a week I was taken out and driven by each of the ladies. All of them seemed quite comfortable with me, even Ms. Lavinia, who had worried so much about my falling again. So they decided to keep me.</p>

	<p>Now I've lived here for one year, and a happy one it has been. Thanks to Joe Green, I am receiving the excellent care I had received back at Birtwick Park. And I am now, once again, known as Black Beauty.</p>

	<p>Willie, my hero, comes to see me every once in a while. On one occasion, when Mr Thoroughgood accompanied him, I heard the old man say that I should live to be at least twenty years old. After receiving the letter from Miss Ellen, the Gordons responded quickly, expressing their wish that I never be sold again, now that I'm in such good hands. And the ladies promised to honor their wish.</p>

	<p>So here is where my story comes to an end. And with all my troubles and sadness behind me, I often find myself dreaming happily about that day at Birtwick Park, which I spent with my friends under the apple tree.</p>
