	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER EIGHT</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">T</span>hat night, Harriet spent the night at the Woodhouses', as she often did. The next morning, she had to return to the school to speak with Mrs Goddard, but would return to see Emma in the afternoon. Soon after Harriet left, Mr George Knightley came for a visit.</p>

	<p>"I believe Harriet will soon have an offer of marriage, from Robert Martin, who is completely in love with her," Mr Knightley said with a smile.</p>

	<p>"Is Mr Martin sure that Harriet wants to marry him?" Emma responded.</p>

	<p>"I believe he does. He came to speak to me about this matter two nights ago. I told him he should propose marriage to Harriet. Mr Martin is an honest, hard-working, and intelligent man. Harriet is lucky to have such a man in love with her. Perhaps he is at the school proposing to her now."</p>

	<p>"He wrote Harriet a letter yesterday, and was refused."</p>

	<p>"That cannot be, Harriet Smith would never refuse Robert Martin."</p>

	<p>"It is true. I saw her answer."</p>

	<p>"You saw her answer! You wrote her answer, too. Emma, you persuaded her to refuse him, didn't you?"</p>

	<p>"Harriet is far above him. She can find a better husband than Mr Martin."</p>

	<p>"My only problem in advising Mr Martin was that he could find a better wife than Harriet. I thought you would agree to this marriage. Harriet would be fortunate to marry Robert Martin."</p>

	<p>"She is superior to Mr Martin in society. She has grown up as a lady; he has grown up as a farmer. They should not marry."</p>

	<p>"Harriet did not want to improve her position in society before she met you. She was content with her simple education. Her friends approved of her and Mr Martin together. Harriet was always happy with the Martins before she met you, and Robert Martin knew Harriet was interested."</p>

	<p>"Harriet is a young girl. She does not have to marry the first man who proposes marriage. Let her choose a husband."</p>

	<p>"Let her marry Robert Martin, and then she will be safe, respectable, and happy for ever. If you insist that she marry a wealthy man, she will never marry."</p>

	<p>"We think so very differently, Mr Knightley. She was interested in Mr Martin only because he was the first man to fall in love with her. He has bad manners and no education. Harriet now knows what a gentleman is, and Mr Martin is not a gentleman," Emma declared.</p>

	<p>"That's not true," cried Mr Knightley, "Robert Martin is sincere and shows better manners than Harriet."</p>

	<p>Emma did not respond, but tried to look cheerful, though she felt uncomfortable that Mr Knightley was so upset that Harriet refused Mr Martin. Nonetheless, she believed she was correct. She usually agreed with Mr Knightley on most things, so she was upset that he disagreed with her.</p>

	<p>Mr Knightley then said, "I know you love to find husbands for your friends, but if Elton is the man you want Harriet to marry, you are wrong. I have heard him speak about a family of wealthy young ladies that his sisters know well."</p>

	<p>"I do not plan to find Harriet a husband; I just want her to remain a close friend."</p>

	<p>Mr Knightley then left the Woodhouse home, looking rather disappointed. Emma began to worry that Mr Martin may return to Mrs Goddard's school to ask Harriet again to marry him. Mr Knightley's comments about Mr Elton also upset Emma, but she believed he spoke in anger because Emma did not agree with him.</p>

	<p>Soon after, Harriet returned with news about Mr Elton. While Harriet was at Mrs Goddard's school, the local doctor, Mr Perry, was visiting a sick child there. He told Harriet that he saw Mr Elton on his way to London. Mr Perry asked him why he was going. Mr Elton told him he had an important matter, but he would not explain more. Mr Perry said his long journey must be for a lady; and Mr Elton only smiled and rode off. Mr Perry had no idea which lady this important journey was for, however.</p>
