	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER NINE</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">G</span>eorge Knightley was upset with Emma's plans for Harriet. He did not return to Hartfield to visit for quite a long time. Although Emma felt sorry that she and Mr Knightley fought, she knew she was right in persuading Harriet not to marry Mr Martin.</p>

	<p>Mr Elton soon returned with the framed portrait of Harriet, which stayed in the Woodhouse home. Mr Elton often admired the portrait, and spoke of it often.</p>

	<p>Emma knew that Harriet was still upset about Mr Martin. She suggested that Harriet arrange a book of famous poems to distract her from thinking of Robert Martin. The two girls requested many in Highbury to remember poems to use in Harriet's book. Mr Elton was quite interested in the project, and Emma suggested that he write a poem for the book. He eagerly agreed.</p>

	<p>The very next day, he came to Hartfield just to leave a piece of paper on the table. On the paper was a poem, written by Mr Elton himself.</p>

	<p>"I do not offer it for Miss Smith's collection," said he, "but perhaps you may like to look at it."</p>

	<p>He was speaking to Emma more than Harriet, which Emma could understand. He seemed nervous about giving her the paper. Emma knew that it would explain his feelings toward Harriet. He was gone the next moment.</p>

	<p>"Take it," said Emma, smiling, "it is for you."</p>

	<p>But Harriet could not touch it, so Emma read the letter herself.</p>

	<blockquote>

	<p class="styleItalic">To Miss ________</p>

	<p class="c">CHARADE</p>

		<p class="poemLine">My first displays the wealth of kings,</p>

		<p class="poemLine">Lords of the earth, their fortune and ease.</p>

		<p class="poemLine">Another view of man my second brings,</p>

		<p class="poemLine">Behold him there, the king of the seas!</p>

		<p class="poemLine">&#160;</p>

		<p class="poemLine">But ah! United, what reverse we have!</p>

		<p class="poemLine">Man's power and freedom, all are shown:</p>

		<p class="poemLine">Lord of the earth and sea, he bends a slave,</p>

		<p class="poemLine">And woman, lovely woman, rules alone.</p>

		<p class="poemLine">&#160;</p>

		<p class="poemLine">Thy ready wit the word will soon supply,</p>

		<p class="poemLine">May its approval shown in that soft eye!</p>

	</blockquote>

	<p>Emma read the poem and realized the meaning, and passed the paper to Harriet. Emma smiled to herself, while Harriet read it in confusion.</p>

	<p>"What can it be, Miss Woodhouse? Do help me," Harriet asked. Emma then explained the meaning to her dear little friend.</p>

	<blockquote class="letter">

		<p class="poemLine">May its approval shown in that soft eye!</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>Harriet exactly. Her eyes are the softest.</p>

	<blockquote class="letter">

		<p class="poemLine">Thy ready wit the word will soon supply.</p>

	</blockquote>

	<p>Emma thought to herself, "Mr Elton must be quite in love with Harriet to say she has wit. Harriet does have soft eyes, but cleverness and wit, perhaps not."</p>

	<blockquote class="letter">

		<p class="styleItalic">For Miss ____, read Miss Smith.</p>

		<p class="poemLine">My first displays the wealth of kings,</p>

		<p class="poemLine">Lords of the earth, their fortune and ease.</p>

	</blockquote>

	<p>He is speaking of a king's court.</p>

	<blockquote class="letter">

		<p class="poemLine">Another view of man my second brings,</p>

		<p class="poemLine">Behold him there, the king of the seas!</p>

	</blockquote>

	<p>He means a ship on the sea.</p>

	<blockquote class="letter">

		<p class="poemLine">But ah! United (courtship, you know),</p>

		<p class="poemLine">what reverse we have!</p>

		<p class="poemLine">Man's power and freedom, all are shown:</p>

		<p class="poemLine">Lord of the earth and sea, he bends a slave,</p>

		<p class="poemLine">And woman, lovely woman, rules alone.</p>

	</blockquote>

	<p>A courtship, a romance, between himself and Miss Harriet Smith, the lovely woman who rules alone as his queen.</p>

	<p>"Dear Miss Woodhouse!" and "Dear Miss Woodhouse!" was all that Harriet could say.</p>

	<p>"It is a certainty. You and Mr Elton belong to one another," Emma declared.</p>

	<p>"Mr Elton is in love with me, I cannot believe it! Oh, Miss Woodhouse, you understand everything! You and Mr Elton are both so clever. This charade! I could never understand this!"</p>

	<p>Later that evening, Mr Elton came to speak with Mr Woodhouse. Harriet could not look at him, but Emma gave him a friendly smile, and carefully placed his poem in his hand.</p>

	<p>"Oh, here is the charade you left us. Thank you for allowing us to read. I hope you do not mind that Miss Smith will write it into her book."</p>

	<p>Mr Elton did not know what to say, he looked rather confused. He left shortly with a look of confusion and annoyance.</p>
