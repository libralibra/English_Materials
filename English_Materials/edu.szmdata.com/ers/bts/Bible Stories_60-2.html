	<p class="storyTitle">60. Jesus Is Arrested</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">J</span>esus led the disciples to a garden called Gethsemane outside the city. He took Peter, James, and John with him to stay with him, and told everyone else to stand guard. And they saw him go ahead from them and fell to the ground. Praying to God.</p>

	<p>When Jesus came back to the place he had left the three disciples, he found them asleep. He was angry with them because they had not stayed awake to keep watch.</p>

	<p>Jesus awakened the disciples. "Get up now," he said. "The person who is betraying me is here."</p>

	<p>They saw Judas coming toward them with a group of soldiers and priests from the temple.</p>

	<p>"The person I will kiss is the man you want," Judas whispered to the soldiers. Then he walked over to greet Jesus with a kiss.</p>

	<p>"Why have you come here?" Jesus asked, even though he knew the answer.</p>

	<p>"We're looking for Jesus of Nazareth," one of the soldiers said.'</p>

	<p>"I am he," Jesus answered.</p>

	<p>Peter pulled his sword and cut off the ear of one of the men.</p>

	<p>"Put that sword away," Jesus said to him. "This is the way my Father wants it."</p>

	<p>Then Jesus said, "Why are you arresting me here like I was a thief? You could have taken me while I was in the temple."</p>

	<p>Jesus' disciples were very afraid. They ran away as the soldiers tied up Jesus and took him back to Jerusalem.</p>

	<p>All that night, the priests and religious leaders questioned people, wanting to find someone who had seen Jesus do or say something wrong. Then they could convict Jesus and have him put to death.</p>

	<p>One by one, witnesses were brought in, but none of them gave stories that made Jesus look like a criminal.</p>

	<p>"I heard him say he could tear down the temple and build it back in three days," said one witness.</p>

	<p>"What do you say about that?" the high priest asked Jesus.</p>

	<p>Jesus said nothing.</p>

	<p>"Are you or are you not Christ, the Son of God?" the priests yelled.</p>

	<p>"I am," Jesus said. "Soon you will see me sitting at the right hand of God."</p>

	<p>"Did you hear that?" the priest shouted. "What more proof do we need? This man actually thinks he is the Son of God!"</p>

	<p>Everyone began to yell that Jesus should be crucified. They spit at him. The servants covered his face so he could not see.</p>

	<p>Peter followed the soldiers to find out where they were taking Jesus.</p>

	<p>Then he was questioned whether he was a disciple of Jesus three times by some of the servants of the high priest. At the moment he denied it the last time, the cock crowed. Remembering the word of the lord, Peter went out and wept bitterly.</p>
