	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER FOURTEEN</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">A</span>s the group entered the Westons' home, Emma thought that Mr Elton should smile less with Harriet's absence. Mr John Knightley should smile more, she thought, although he was unhappy about the long journey in bad weather.</p>

	<p>Emma decided to forget about Mr Elton for the evening, although she wondered if he truly was in love with her, and not her dear, little friend, Harriet. When they all sat down for dinner, however, she noticed that he sat next to her, smiling at her quite often. She began to wonder, "Can it be possible for this man to be in love with me, not Harriet anymore? Impossible!" Yet, throughout the dinner, he often told her how he admired her drawing of Harriet, and made sure Emma was comfortable, just as a lover would do.</p>

	<p>During the dinner, Mr Weston began to speak of his son, Frank Churchill. Emma, although not wanting to marry, thought Frank Churchill would be an agreeable choice for her. Since his father's marriage to Mrs Weston, she had thought about this possibility more frequently. Mr Weston announced, during the dinner, that his son, Frank, would be coming in a short time for a visit.</p>

	<p>"He has wanted to come to us since September, but the Churchill family has kept him rather busy. His aunt, quite an unhappy woman, demands Frank's time. She has made it difficult for him to plan a visit," Mr Weston told the dinner party.</p>

	<p>"He ought to come," said Emma. "Even if he can only come for a couple of days, he ought to come," Emma told him.</p>

	<p>"But Frank is her aunt's favourite nephew. The Churchills are rather envious, and do not want Frank to spend time here," replied Mrs Weston.</p>

	<p>Emma responded coolly: "I will not be satisfied unless he comes."</p>
