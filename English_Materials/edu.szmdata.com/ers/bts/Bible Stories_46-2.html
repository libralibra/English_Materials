	<p class="storyTitle">46. The Five Thousand</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">T</span>he disciples had followed Jesus for a long time. They had heard him preach, seen his miracles, and learned the lessons he taught them. Now they were ready to go out on their own and spread the good news of God's forgiveness through the Savior.</p>

	<p>Jesus gave the disciples instructions before they went on their journey.</p>

	<p>"Don't take anything with you except a loaf of bread," he said. "You won't need any extra clothes or money."</p>

	<p>He told them to go to each house along the way.</p>

	<p>"If they let you in, go in and tell them everything I have told you about being born again into God's kingdom. But if you go to a place and they will not let you in, wipe the dust off your feet as a sign to them that God has brushed them off."</p>

	<p>Then Jesus sent the disciples out, two by two, into the land. They each had the same kind of powers Jesus had to call out evil spirits and heal the sick. So they were able to help Jesus in all his work.</p>

	<p>When the disciples returned from their journey, they were anxious to tell Jesus about what they had seen and done. They looked for a quiet place to meet and talk, but the people soon found out where they were hiding. By the day's end, nearly five thousand people had arrived to hear Jesus!</p>

	<p>No one had eaten, and the disciples were hungry.</p>

	<p>"Let's send everyone away, so we can eat dinner," they said.</p>

	<p>Jesus told them to feed the crowd whatever food they had.</p>

	<p>"But we only have two fish and five loaves of bread," they argued. "That won't feed many people."</p>

	<p>Make them sit down in groups of fifty," Jesus instructed.</p>

	<p>The disciples did as Jesus asked. Then Jesus took the bread and fish and raised them up. He said a prayer, blessed the food, and broke it into pieces.</p>

	<p>The disciples passed out the food to the people, and everyone ate plenty. There was even some left over!</p>
