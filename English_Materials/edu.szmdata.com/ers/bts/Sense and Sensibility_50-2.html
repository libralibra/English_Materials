	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER FIFTY</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">E</span>dward apologized a great deal to his mother, and she soon forgave him, not wishing to continue having problems with her children any longer. She attempted to persuade him to marry the honorable Miss Morton, but Edward insisted that he wished only to marry Elinor. Mrs Ferrars, at last, agreed to the marriage. As for their fortune, she promised them one thousand pounds a year, which was a great deal more than they had hoped for. They were soon married, and moved to their new home in Devonshire. Their friends and family, including the Dashwoods and Mrs Ferrars, visited them.</p>

	<p>After some time, Mrs Ferrars forgave her second son and his low-class wife. Soon enough, however, Lucy used her abilities to flatter her mother-in-law, and soon became one of their mother's favorites, settling with her husband in town where they received a great fortune from his mother. Aside from Robert and Lucy's fights and disagreements, they lived happily together, and became close friends of John and Fanny Dashwood.</p>

	<p>Mrs Ferrars, however, could never completely forgive Edward for once becoming engaged to Lucy, nor could she forgive Elinor for marrying Edward, though she had a greater fortune and was of higher-class than Lucy.</p>

	<p>Marianne soon recovered from her heartache at seventeen. She began spending a great deal of time with Colonel Brandon, and came to greatly respect him. She realized in time that she, indeed, cared for the Colonel. After two years, she and the Colonel were happily married, and she grew to love him more than she had ever loved Willoughby.</p>

	<p>Willoughby was pained after hearing of Marianne's marriage to Colonel Brandon. Soon after his marriage, Mrs Smith forgave him for his terrible behavior, and gave him the fortune he once so desperately needed, which made him think that if he had treated Marianne well, he could have been happy and rich. He did grow to love his wife, but always viewed Marianne as the true image of womanly perfection.</p>

	<p>Between Barton and Delaford, there was always communication, as Mrs Dashwood had decided to keep her cottage while Margaret was still so young. Though, she often stayed with her two daughters, who lived in happiness with their husbands, who became great friends, as well.</p>
