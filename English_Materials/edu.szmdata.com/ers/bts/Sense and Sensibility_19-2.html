	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER NINETEEN</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">E</span>dward stayed a week at the cottage. Elinor understood that Mrs Ferrars, Edward's mother, was quite controlling of her son, and would not approve of a long visit to the Dashwoods, as she did not approve of a connection between Edward and Elinor. She was sure of his love for her, as she looked at the ring of hair around his finger.</p>

	<p>Immediately after Edward's departure, Elinor began occupying her time with painting and drawing. Marianne was astonished to see how calm her sister looked after Edward's leaving.</p>

	<p>One morning, as she sat drawing, she was interrupted by the arrival of the Middletons, Mrs Jennings, and a mysterious couple.</p>

	<p>The guests came into the house, and the couple was introduced as Mr and Mrs Palmer. Mrs Charlotte Palmer was Lady Middleton's sister, a pretty, cheerful young woman. She was several years younger than Lady Middleton, and very different from her sister. She was short and plump, with a pretty face. She certainly did not have the elegance of her sister, but she was a great deal more agreeable. She came in with a smile&#151;smiled all the time of her visit. Her husband was a serious-looking man of twenty-five or six, with more grace and fashion than his wife, but much less friendly. He entered the room, greeted the Dashwoods quickly before sitting down at the table to read his newspaper, and continued to read it as long as he stayed.</p>

	<p>The Middletons soon left with their guests to return to Barton Park. Upon their departure, Sir John requested that the Dashwoods come to Barton the next evening for dinner. Mrs Dashwood refused, as she would not dine at the Middletons' more than they dined at her home, which she considered only to be politeness. Sir John declared that they must come dine at Barton Park, as his guests would like their company, so the Dashwood women were required to go for dinner.</p>

	<p>"The rent of this cottage is said to be low, but we certainly pay in other ways if we always have to dine at Barton Park whenever anyone is staying with either them or with us."</p>

	<p>"The Middletons only mean to be kind to us now," said Elinor.</p>
