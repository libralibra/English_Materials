	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER FIFTY-THREE</p>

	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">Conclusion</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">W</span>hile I was standing outside the gate, a carriage stopped at the house. I did not look at it, but soon I heard a child's voice&#151;</p>

	<p>"Mamma, Mamma, here's Mr Markham!"</p>

	<p>Mrs Huntingdon stepped out of the carriage and greeted me calmly, "Were you coming to see us, or only passing by?"</p>

	<p>"I&#151;I came to see the place," I whispered.</p>

	<p>"Well, please do come in."</p>

	<p>"Yes, yes, you must come in," cried Arthur.</p>

	<p>We walked into the house, and sat down.</p>

	<p>"Now, tell me how everyone is. What news is there? Nobody dead? Nobody married?" she paused, "or expecting to marry? No old friendships forgotten?" she asked as she looked at me.</p>

	<p>"I believe not. Certainly not for me."</p>

	<p>"Aunt, this man is my brother's close friend, and was my own dear friend for a few short months."</p>

	<p>"If I had known," I said, "that you would have remembered me as a dear friend, I would have come to visit earlier, but I thought you had forgotten me long ago."</p>

	<p>"You were certainly mistaken."</p>

	<p>Little Arthur left the room to help his grandma, and there was silence for a short time. She looked quite anxious, walking around the room, then sitting, then opening a book. She seemed nervously excited.</p>

	<p>"Gilbert, what is the matter with you? Why are you so changed?"</p>

	<p>"I am not changed, Helen&#151;Mrs Huntingdon, but the situation has changed."</p>

	<p>"What situation? Do tell me!" she exclaimed.</p>

	<p>"I'll tell you," I said. "I came here to see you, although I feared seeing you, as perhaps you had forgotten me. I did not want to disturb you, so I thought I should not see you."</p>

	<p>She was quiet, but soon spoke, "And if my aunt and I had not been returning, I would never have heard from you again?"</p>

	<p>"I thought it would be better for both that we should not meet, but I am now glad to see you once more, and to know that you have not forgotten me."</p>

	<p>"Why did you not write to me?"</p>

	<p>"I did not know your address, and did not want to ask your brother, because I thought he would not want me to write. He never mentioned that you asked about me, so I thought you had forgotten me."</p>

	<p>"I did ask about you, frequently."</p>

	<p>"Your brother never told me that you mentioned my name."</p>

	<p>"Did you ever ask him?"</p>

	<p>"No, Mrs Huntingdon, I believed he did not wish me to speak of you," I said quietly.</p>

	<p>After a short silence, she spoke again. "You have changed, and why 'Mrs Huntingdon,' and not Helen?"</p>

	<p>"Helen, then&#151;dear Helen!"</p>

	<p>"I thought of you often, and frequently asked my brother about you, but you never spoke of me. I cared about you deeply."</p>

	<p>"If you still love me, would you not refuse me if I asked you to marry me?"</p>

	<p>"You know I would accept," she said smiling.</p>

	<p>"My dear Helen&#151;my own Helen!"</p>

	<p>"My aunt must not know of it yet. She would think I was being careless. She must know you herself. You must leave us now, and come again in the spring, and I know you will like each other."</p>

	<p>"And then, you will be mine," I said as I kissed her hand.</p>

	<p>"No&#151;in another year," she replied.</p>

	<p>"Another year! Oh, Helen, I could not wait so long!"</p>

	<p>"I will write every day. I must first tell my friends and family. We must not marry in the winter, in December, as I was last married in December. Next spring, perhaps."</p>

	<p>"Next spring!"</p>

	<p>"No, no&#151;next autumn perhaps."</p>

	<p>"Summer, then."</p>

	<p>"Well, the end of summer," she said.</p>

	<p>At that moment, little Arthur came into the room. From that moment, I regarded that dear boy as my own son. That pretty child is a fine gentleman, living at Grassdale Manor with his young wife, little Helen Hattersley, daughter of Ralph and Milicent Hattersley.</p>

	<p>But now, I must end this letter, as perhaps it is too long already. I did come again in the spring, and her aunt grew to love me, as I love her, as well. She did request that after we married, we would continue to live with her at Staningley. I happily agreed.</p>

	<p>We have lived in perfect happiness together. We are expecting you and Rose very soon for a visit, and hope to see you both.</p>

	<p>Till then, goodbye,</p>

	<p class="r">GILBERT MARKHAM.</p>

	<p class="r">Staningley,</p>

	<p class="r">June 10th, 1847.</p>
