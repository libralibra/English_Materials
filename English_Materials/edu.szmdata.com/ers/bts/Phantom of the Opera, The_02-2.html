	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER TWO</p>

	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">The Letters from the Phantom</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">M</span>eanwhile, in another part of town the opera's old owners, Debienne and Poligny, were having dinner with the new owners, Richard and Montcharmin. After they had eaten and drank much of the restaurant's fine wine, the owners told Richard and Montcharmin that they had one last thing to tell them about the opera house. It must be told before the men became the opera house's new owners.</p>

	<p>Poligny took out a piece of paper from his coat pocket. It was a note, written in a beautiful handwriting with red ink. The note said that the owners of the Paris Opera House must give someone calling himself "the Phantom of the Opera" 20,000 francs every month. Also, this "Phantom" asked that opera box number 5 be left open. It seemed that the Phantom enjoyed watching the operas from that place!</p>

	<p>"What is this nonsense?" the new owners said, laughing.</p>

	<p>Debienne and Poligny looked serious. "My friends, you should take this seriously. We do not know the truth about the Phantom of the Opera, but we know he is real. Believe me; he will be very angry if he is not obeyed. He has done things to us before," said Debienne.</p>

	<p>Richard and Montcharmin were reasonable men. They certainly did not believe in ghosts or "phantoms". And 20,000 francs was a lot of money. They were not going to give that much money to some ridiculous man, who was probably crazy anyway. They believed that the old owners were playing a very complicated joke on them. They decided to ignore the note. Soon they had forgotten all about the ridiculous "Phantom".</p>

	<p>One afternoon, after a large and delicious lunch at a nearby restaurant, Richard entered his office. He had sat down at his desk and was thinking about taking a short rest when he saw a note lying on the table. It was written in the same beautiful writing, with red ink as the first note.</p>

	<blockquote class="letter">

	<p>Monsieur Richard</p>

	<p>I am sorry to disturb you at this time. Certainly I understand that you must be very busy learning to manage this fine Opera House. For myself I am sorry to have missed several of your wonderful operas. It is unfortunate that people continue to buy Box Number 5, when I have asked for it.</p>

	<p>Debienne and Poligny have written to me. They tell me they have warned you about my little requests. At the moment, it seems that you have decided not to pay attention. Since I am sure that you have only forgotten, I will ask you once again: do not sell Box Number 5, or you will suffer the results.</p>

	<p class="r">The Phantom of the Opera</p>

	</blockquote>

	<p>Richard was thinking about this strange letter when Montcharmin entered the room, very upset. He had the very same letter in his hand.</p>

	<p>Richard and Montcharmin spoke together for some time. They were beginning to think that this joke of Debienne and Poligny's was becoming very irritating. Why were they bothering the new owners with stupid ghost stories? Richard and Montcharmin decided that perhaps the old owners simply missed their theater, and wanted to have some fun. Montcharmin said that for the Opera House's future shows, they should give Opera Box 5 to the old managers. Certainly this would make the ridiculous old men feel better!</p>

	<p>The next day the managers received a letter from Debienne and Poligny. It thanked Richard and Montcharmin for kindly offering them Opera Box 5. But Debienne and Poligny would not dare to take that Box away from the terrible Phantom! Who knew what would happen?</p>

	<p>That same day they received a letter from the Phantom. It thanked them for leaving Opera Box 5 open. "I had a very wonderful evening," the letter continued, "but please do not forget to give me 20,000 francs every month! I shall be waiting for it."</p>

	<p>Richard and Montcharmin were rather angry. They still believed that the old owners were playing a trick on them, and they did not have time for any more jokes. They decided to ignore the Phantom of the Opera's letters if they came.</p>

	<p>For the next weeks Opera Box 5 was sold as usual. However, the unfortunate person who bought the Box did not get to enjoy the opera. Whenever anyone tried to enter the box, they would hear a strange, cold voice. It said, "I am sorry, Monsieur or Madame, but this Box is already taken. Kindly find another seat." The person saw no one in the box, and they did not know where the voice was coming from.</p>

	<p>Then the frightened person would jump out of the box and look into it, wondering. Each time they did this, the box would be empty. They would tell themselves that they had only imagined the voice. So, they would bravely step back into the box, but they would run away frightened when the terrible voice spoke to them again!</p>

	<p>"Oh, no! The Phantom of the Opera has come to haunt us!" this person would say. And, of course, the others only laughed at the poor customer because they did not believe in ghosts.</p>

	<p>After this experience the people who bought Box 5 would ask for their money back. Poor Richard and Montcharmin were very angry, because people's stories about Box 5 and the Phantom of the Opera were ruining their business! They were tired of hearing things about the ridiculous Phantom. They thought that if "the Phantom" was not the old managers playing tricks, then he was someone else&#151;maybe a young man who did not like opera! Eventually, Richard and Montcharmin decided that they would watch one performance inside Box 5. They were determined to solve the mystery.</p>
