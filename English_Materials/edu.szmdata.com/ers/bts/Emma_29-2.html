	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER TWENTY-NINE</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">F</span>rank Churchill had danced once at Highbury, and wished to dance again. One evening at the Westons, he suggested that they plan another dance. The Westons and Miss Woodhouse thought another dance would be a wonderful idea. Mr Woodhouse, however, disagreed.</p>

	<p>"Oh, no," said he, "Emma would catch a cold, and so would poor little Harriet, and so would you all. Do not tell his father, but young Mr Churchill (speaking in a quiet voice) is quite thoughtless."</p>

	<p>Some time later, Mr Churchill began, "Well, Miss Woodhouse, I hope you will dance with me at the next dance."</p>

	<p>Emma was delighted. Soon after, she heard Mr Weston whisper to his wife:</p>

	<p>"He has asked her, my dear. I knew he would!"</p>

	<p>The Westons, Mr Churchill, and Miss Woodhouse began to make plans for the dance. Frank sent a letter to his aunt and uncle, requesting to stay in Highbury for a few days longer, which they could not refuse. And a delightful dance was planned.</p>
