	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE</p>

	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">The School</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">J</span>ulien found the school, but he was nervous again. He waited ten minutes to knock on the door. He told a frightening man he wanted to see Mr Pirard, the master of the school. They went up to a simple room. A poorly dressed man was writing there. Then the man looked at him with terrible eyes. "Your name?" he said.</p>

	<p>"Julien Sorel."</p>

	<p>"You're very late." Julien could not look at the eyes again, and he fell to the ground.</p>

	<p>When Julien woke up, the man said, "You were recommended to me by Father Ch&#x00E9;lan. He was the best priest in the area, and my friend for thirty years."</p>

	<p>"Ah! So you are Mr Pirard," Julien said.</p>

	<p>"Yes. Father Ch&#x00E9;lan wrote me a short letter about you. He wrote, 'I am sending you Julien Sorel. He is very smart and has a good memory, but I don't know if his faith is true. I ask that you let Julien come to school here. He can take any test you want. I have taught him what I could.'"</p>

	<p>"Do you speak Latin?" Father Pirard asked, in Latin.</p>

	<p>Julien answered him in Latin, and they talked for a long time.</p>

	<p>Father Pirard questioned him about religion and was surprised by Julien's knowledge of the Bible. He knew nothing about the church father's writings, though. Julien's mind was very good, and Father Pirard decided to allow him to attend the school.</p>

	<p>"I don't often allow people to attend my school, but Father Ch&#x00E9;lan has worked for many years teaching you. This is his reward," Father Pirard said. "While you're here, do not join any secret groups, and be careful with your money."</p>

	<p>He called the other man and said, "Take Julien Sorel to room 103."</p>

	<p>It was a great honor to get a private room. Julien was also happy with the view. He could see the river Doubs. The day had been very difficult, and Julien fell asleep right away. When he woke up in the morning, he was lying on the floor.</p>
