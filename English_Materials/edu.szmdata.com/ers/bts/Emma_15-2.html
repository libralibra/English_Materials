	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER FIFTEEN</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">A</span>fter dinner and tea, the weather worsened, and the family decided to return to Hartfield before too much snow fell. Emma found herself alone in a carriage with Mr Elton returning home. She noticed that Mr Elton had drunk too much wine, and as soon as the two were comfortably sitting together, he began to tell her how deeply he loved her.</p>

	<p>"I am astonished, Mr Elton! Your pursuit of Harriet gave me pleasure."</p>

	<p>"Miss Harriet Smith! I was never interested in Harriet. She has no fortune, and still no one knows who her parents are. I only thought of her as your friend, not as a lover. Who can think of Miss Smith when Miss Woodhouse is near? I have thought only of you," the drunken Mr Elton declared.</p>

	<p>"My visits to Hartfield have been for yourself only!"</p>

	<p>"Sir, you have been mistaken. I am sorry, but I do not want to marry at present. I only saw you as someone in love with my friend, not my lover."</p>

	<p>He was too angry to speak another word. Emma was quite upset, as well. The two did not speak another word on the way home.</p>
