	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER THREE</p>

	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">Care of the Poor</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">T</span>he priest of Verri&#xE8;res was Father Ch&#x00E9;lan. He was eighty years old, but still very strong. He had the right to visit the prison and poor house. Mr Appert had come with a letter from Marquis de la Mole, a noble and a rich landowner. Still, he was very worried. "I'm old and well loved here," he thought, "They wouldn't dare replace me." The Father decided to take Mr Appert where he wished to go.</p>

	<p>Two days later, Mr de R&#x00EA;nal and the master of the poor house, Mr Valenod, came to speak with the priest. The priest defended himself, saying, "I've lived here for fifty-six years. Every day I marry young people whose grandparents I married years ago. Verri&#x00E8;res is my family." The Mayor and Mr Valenod were still angry, though.</p>

	<p>"All right, then," said Father Ch&#xE9;lan. "Remove me from office. My land brings me money. I will survive. I am not afraid."</p>

	<p>At this time, the Mayor's three sons were becoming difficult. Mr de R&#x00EA;nal had an idea. "I've decided to hire young Sorel to tutor the children. He's almost a priest and knows Latin. I thought perhaps he was a liberal, but Father Ch&#x00E9;lan says he's a good young man."</p>

	<p>"This will make me look good," he continued. "Mr Valenod has two very nice new horses, but he doesn't have a tutor for his children. We must keep up our social class."</p>

	<p>This idea left Mrs de R&#x00EA;nal deep in thought. She was always considered beautiful but simple. Many people had tried to marry her, including Mr Valenod. Others thought her silly, but she was happy in her simple life. She thought mostly of her children, and she thought her husband was a polite man. Others did too&#151;when he wasn't speaking of money&#151;and Mr de R&#x00EA;nal was considered the finest man in Verri&#xE8;res.</p>
