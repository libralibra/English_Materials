	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">The First Steps</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">E</span>arly the next morning, Julien was working in the library. Ms de la Mole came in through a secret door. She was surprised to see him, and she took a copy of a book by Voltaire. Voltaire was not considered good reading for a young noble woman.</p>

	<p>In the afternoon Count Norbert came in. He had forgotten about Julien. The count suggested they go riding. "I can cut down trees," Julien said, "but I've only been riding six times."</p>

	<p>"This will be the seventh!" Count Norbert said. "Come on."</p>

	<p>Julien rode well most of the day, but at the end he fell into the mud. Later Marquis de la Mole asked his son about the ride. Count Norbert was very polite, but Julien told the story honestly. The marquis was surprised. "This man will go far," he said to the professor. "He'll tell the truth about this bad event."</p>

	<p>Later Ms de la Mole asked him to tell the story again, and Julien, Ms Mathilde, and Count Norbert laughed like young friends. Even with these friendly people, however, Julien still felt alone. He was too different.</p>
