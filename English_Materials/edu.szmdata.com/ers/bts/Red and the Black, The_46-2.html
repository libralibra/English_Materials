	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER SIXTEEN</p>

	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">Cruel Moments</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">M</span>s de la Mole thought of nothing except almost being killed. He's worthy of being my master, since he almost killed me. How many fine young men from high society could have a thought like that? He looked handsome when he returned the sword. I wasn't crazy to love him after all.</p>

	<p>At dinner she talked to Julien, and she ordered him to follow her to the garden. She looked curiously at the hands that almost killed her, and she began to tell him about the feelings she used to have for Marquis de Croisenois. Julien had never felt worse. His heart ached with jealousy.</p>

	<p>Julien had thought himself better than de Croisenois, but now he suffered. He admired Mathilde so much that he almost fell to her feet and asked for mercy.</p>

	<p>This pain went on for almost a week. Mathilde enjoyed causing Julien pain. Julien could have changed her feelings, but he did not understand them. Instead he finally said, "You don't love me anymore, but I love you!"</p>

	<p>This was the biggest mistake he could have made. In one moment he destroyed all the good feelings in Mathilde's heart. Mathilde, sure of being loved, hated him completely.</p>

	<p>Julien did not understand anything from the last week, but he understood this hate. He avoided her and told the marquis he was sick.</p>

	<p>Mathilde was again bored with de Croisenois and de Luz. These men were always scared of a revolution, but if she was with Julien she would not be afraid. He had ambition and character but no money or friends. She could give these to him, but her mind still treated Julien like a lesser person, one who could be made to love at any time.</p>
