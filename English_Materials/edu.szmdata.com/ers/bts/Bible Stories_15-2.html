	<p class="storyTitle">15. Brothers Meet Again</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">J</span>acob gathered his family the next day, and they went out to meet Esau. Jacob walked in front. He wanted to be the first to greet his brother. If Esau still wanted to kill him, maybe he would go ahead and do it and leave his family alone.</p>

	<p>At last Jacob was face to face with Esau. He bowed to him seven times. Esau ran towards him, throwing his arms around him. Jacob hugged him back. He was happy to be friends with his brother again.</p>

	<p>Esau asked about the people with Jacob.</p>

	<p>"These are the children God has blessed me with," said Jacob. He brought out the servants and their children first. Then he introduced Leah and Rachel to his brother.</p>

	<p>"What were all those other animals that came before you?" he asked.</p>

	<p>Jacob explained that he had many sheep and goats in his herds. He wanted to share them with his brother. Esau thanked Jacob and asked him if he could continue on with them on their journey. Jacob told him to go ahead since they could not travel as fast as Esau's group. Again Jacob felt blessed because God had helped him make peace with his brother.</p>
