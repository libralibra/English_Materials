	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">H</span>arriet arrived at Abbey-Mill, the Martins' farm; although, Emma decided the visit would be only fifteen minutes long. She was fearful and curious about the visit. The visit was painful for Harriet. She remembered the pleasant times she had at the Martins'. She had visited many times the summer before. Mrs Martin commented that Harriet had grown, which reminded them all of the summer before, when she was measured with her two friends by the window. Mr Martin had measured her, although he was not present for this painful visit. They all remembered the day, the hour, the same content feeling of that time. Just then, Emma's carriage returned, fourteen minutes after Harriet arrived.</p>

	<p>Emma wished the Martins were members of her high society, but they were not, so how could Harriet marry someone of such low class? Impossible! Harriet must separate from them, but this separation was quite painful for Harriet. Emma, as well, was in pain; she was hurt from the guilt she felt over Harriet's love for Mr Elton.</p>

	<p>When they returned to the Woodhouse home, the Westons were there for a visit. Mr Weston was particularly joyful with news that his son, Mr Frank Churchill, would come tomorrow for a two-week visit.</p>

	<p>"We shall enjoy him completely; everything has turned out exactly as we could wish," Mr Weston announced, content.</p>

	<p>The next day, Emma went on an afternoon walk. When she returned, she saw two gentlemen sitting with her father&#151;Mr Weston and his son, the famous Mr Frank Churchill. He was a very good-looking young man, and she immediately liked him. He was interested in talking to her; Emma was certain that he came to meet her. He was pleased with his father's home, and with Highbury.</p>

	<p>"My father's marriage to Mrs Weston was a wise decision," he told the Woodhouses. He seemed pleased with his new mother.</p>

	<p>Emma noticed Mr Weston glancing at Emma and his son with a happy expression. Emma was quite pleased with meeting Mr Churchill. They said goodbye politely, as he had to visit Miss Jane Fairfax, whom he had met in Weymouth, while she was vacationing there with the Campbells.</p>
