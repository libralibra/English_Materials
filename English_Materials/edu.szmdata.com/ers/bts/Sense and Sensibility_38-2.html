	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER THIRTY-EIGHT</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">M</span>rs Jennings was quite impressed with Edward's behavior and spoke of him often. One day, Mrs Jennings and Elinor took a walk to the park. Marianne refused to go, as she knew the Willoughbys had recently returned to London, and feared she might one day see them. Therefore, she rarely went out. While out, Elinor and Mrs Jennings met Miss Anne Steele, who was delighted to see them. She took Elinor away from the group to speak in private, smiling and holding her arm as if they were dear friends.</p>

	<p>"I have never seen Lucy so angry in my life. I thought she would never speak to me after I told the Dashwoods of her engagement to Edward. She has forgiven me, however, and we are closer than ever before. Well, Miss Dashwood, we were quite worried for the first few days after the Dashwoods found out, as we did not hear from Edward during that time. But, on the third day, Lucy decided to write to him. He said that he had been thinking over their engagement, and told her that as he now only had two thousand pounds, quite a small fortune, she was free to end the engagement to find another husband. He begged her to consider, as he did not want her to suffer in poverty with him. He never told her he was tired of her, or that he wished to marry Miss Morton. Lucy refused, however, insisting that she would never leave him. Just then, however, my friend arrived, so I left to come to the park. I know, however, that Edward has spoken of going to Oxford to study to become a minister. Then, perhaps he could find work somewhere so they can marry."</p>

	<p>Soon enough, they returned to their friends, and Elinor left with Mrs Jennings, who was quite eager to hear the news. The next morning, a letter from Lucy Steele came for Elinor.</p>

	<blockquote class="letter">

	<p>I hope Miss Dashwood will be pleased in receiving a letter from me, as you are a dear friend, and I wish to tell you of my good fortune. Edward and I are quite well, as we are still desperately in love, and hope to marry soon. My dear Edward has said he will disregard his mother's anger, as he could not leave me, as he loves me too dearly. He will soon become a minister, and will be looking for employment. I hope you will recommend him to anybody that is in need of a minister's services, and I am sure dear Mrs Jennings, too, will help us if she can. Perhaps she could ask Sir John or Mr Palmer, or any friend that may be able to assist us in finding an income. Poor Anne was much to blame for what she did, but Edward and I are together, so I am no longer upset with her. I hope Mrs Jennings will come visit us sometime soon, we would love to see her, and my cousins would be proud to know her. I hope you will tell Sir John and Lady Middleton, and the dear children to remember us, and give my love to Miss Marianne.</p>

	<p class="r">L. S.</p>

	</blockquote>

	<p>As soon as Elinor had finished it, she gave it to Mrs Jennings to read, as she knew Lucy's reason in writing to her was so Mrs Jennings would be flattered by the letter, and help her in some way. Mrs Jennings was delighted with the letter.</p>

	<p>"Very well indeed! I wish I could employ him! She called me dear Mrs Jennings, you see."</p>
