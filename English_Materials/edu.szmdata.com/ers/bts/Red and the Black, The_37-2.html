	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER SEVEN</p>

	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">The Dance</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">L</span>ater, Mathilde saw Julien talking to Altamira again. Julien usually looked so cold, but he had fire in his eyes. He has so much pride! She thought. He looks like a prince hiding in normal clothes.</p>

	<p>The two men walked past her, and she heard Julien say, "Yes! Danton was a man!"</p>

	<p>She was alarmed. Danton was one of the leaders of the French Revolution. She stopped Julien and said, "Wasn't he a killer?"</p>

	<p>"Some people think so," he said angrily. "But he started as a lawyer, like many people here in this room. Also, he was ugly. That is a serious crime to beautiful people." He walked away quickly.</p>

	<p>Mathilde thought: how could a handsome man like Julien say good things about an ugly person?</p>

	<p>Count Altamira and Julien moved away, but Mathilde followed. They continued to talk about politics. "In these times," Count Altamira said, "people do horrible things, but they don't enjoy them. Everything is boring. You and I are the only ones without guilt, but they hate me because I led a revolution and they hate you because you were born poor.</p>

	<p>"My revolution failed because I did not want to kill three people and take their money. I could have easily succeeded."</p>

	<p>"If I had any power," Julien said, "I'd kill three men to save four lives." He spoke strongly and his eyes were bright. He looked to Mathilde, and she was frightened. She moved away and went to dance.</p>

	<p>Count Altamira continued, "Your society is old. Only appearances matter, not real thoughts. France has many great soldiers but no one like George Washington of America."</p>

	<p>The next day in the library, Julien thought about Danton. What would happen to Danton today? He thought. I know, he'd work for the government. He wouldn't try to fight it. He did steal money, after all. The Spanish revolutionaries did not steal, though, and they were defeated easily.</p>

	<p>These thoughts made Julien very excited, and he did not notice Ms de la Mole at first. When he did he looked at her, all the fire in his eyes died. "You were thinking about something interesting," she said. "Tell me what it is! I won't tell anyone!" she said.</p>

	<p>The fire returned, and Julien said, "Was Danton right to steal? Should the Spanish revolutionaries have stolen or killed to win?" His face was terrible. "If a man wants to change the world, must he be evil to many people?"</p>

	<p>Mathilde was shocked, and she could not look at him. She turned and ran out of the room.</p>
