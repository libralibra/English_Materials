	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER TWO</p>

	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">My Training</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">A</span>s the months and years went on, I grew to become quite a good-looking horse, if I may say so myself. I was all black, the only exception being my right foot and a small mark on my forehead in the shape of a star. And several men had their money ready to give to Farmer Grey as soon as I became old enough to work. But, the farmer promised never to sell any of his horses until they'd reached their fourth year. He didn't feel it was right to work them before that age.</p>

	<p>When, finally, the day came that I was four years old, Farmer Grey began to introduce me to various riding and pulling equipment that I would have to get used to wearing if I hoped to make a good workhorse. He decided to train me, himself, because I was one of his favorite horses, and he feared that some of the other trainers might frighten or hurt me accidentally.</p>

	<p>What I hated most about the equipment, was wearing the bit and bridle. The bit is a metal piece that they put in horses' mouths, and attached to it are the reins, which the riders or carriage drivers pull on to guide the horse. I'd seen my mother wearing these before when she worked, but I never had any idea how much it hurt, because she never complained. Luckily, Farmer Grey was very gentle when he first introduced this equipment to me and afterward, he would always give me some food to eat and try to help me feel better.</p>

	<p>Soon, after I'd become more familiar with the bit and bridle, the farmer started to take me out into the field for walks in the early morning. Then he surprised me one day by putting a saddle on my back and climbing on. At first, I was worried that I wouldn't be able to carry him, because I felt so heavy, but I found myself jogging around the field, letting him guide me with the reins. For a long time, I'd thought the day would never come when I'd be carrying a man on my back. But now I was, and I hoped all of the other horses could see how well I was doing it.</p>

	<p>Now that I could be ridden, I would need horseshoes to protect my feet. So, the next day Farmer Grey took me into the nearest village to see the blacksmith. When he first put them on me, they hurt quite a lot; but I quickly got used to them.</p>

	<p>Next came the harness, which is a large ring that fits around the neck and is used for pulling carriages and wagons. And with the harness also came blinders. Horses are sometimes easily frightened by the things they see around them, so blinders are placed around the horses' eyes, limiting their vision to only what is directly in front of them, and nothing from either side.</p>

	<p>Now, even though a lot of these things were uncomfortable, I never complained or struggled against it. But, one day I became angry when my master put a "scrubber" on me. This is a very tight rope placed under the tail. I was so angry that, if it had been anyone else, I would have kicked him; but I loved Farmer Grey and would never have done anything to hurt him, so I just tried my best to accept this unfortunate piece of equipment.</p>

	<p>So this was all everything I would need to be familiar with in order to become a working horse. Now it was time for me to practice using it. My master took me out with my mother to show me how to pull carriages and wagons. My mother was the best teacher. She showed me how to pull without becoming tired too quickly.</p>

	<p>For additional training, I was sent to another farmer's field. I remember one day running about and then suddenly seeing a huge, fast-moving machine with smoke rising out of the front. It was the first time I'd ever seen a train. I was frightened by the noise and by the way it looked. But looking around me, I noticed that none of the other animals in the field seemed frightened or surprised, so I soon lost my fear of trains, as well.</p>

	<p>A couple of weeks later, after I'd returned to Farmer Grey's field, I remember running with my mother and her stopping suddenly and saying to me, "Blackie, you must understand that not all men in this world are like Farmer Grey. Some men are horrible horse owners, who don't take care of their animals, and even beat them for no good reason. I hope that this never happens to you, but if it does, I want you to always do your best, like your father did. If you always do your best, life will eventually get better." At first, I thought these words strange, because I never imagined having any other owner except Farmer Grey; but then I remembered seeing horses leaving the farm with strangers and never coming back, and I quickly realized that it was soon to be my turn.</p>
