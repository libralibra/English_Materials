	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">H</span>elen was sitting with Leonard in the coffee room of the hotel, while Mrs Bast was fast asleep in the bedroom.</p>

	<p>"You know, talking with Mr Wilcox won't be easy," she warned him. "He was not taught to be understanding of others. It's possible he may refuse to help you."</p>

	<p>"Well, thank you all the same for helping to get an interview with him."</p>

	<p>"He's one of those supermen, who have never used the word, 'I', in their life."</p>

	<p>"Ah, yes&#160;... the philosophers have a theory about those kinds of people. They think that they'll one day completely take over all power and rule over everyone."</p>

	<p>"Tell me, are you happy with your wife?" asked Helen, changing the subject.</p>

	<p>"I suppose that it's pretty clear that we aren't the best couple, but I've married her and I must stay with her," he answered.</p>

	<p>"What does your family think?"</p>

	<p>"They're not speaking to me any longer. In fact, they don't claim to know me at all. It's only my brother and sister now. Both of my parents are dead."</p>

	<p>"And why are they so against you now?"</p>

	<p>He said nothing, but looked at the ground.</p>

	<p>"You can tell me everything, Mr Bast. I'm your friend, now."</p>

	<p>But he could not. There was a lot to tell, after all, and he, especially, did not want to tell her what he knew about Jacky and Mr Wilcox. He decided not to say anything more about his wife. But then Helen began to have tears in her eyes.</p>

	<p>"What will you do?" she asked, her voice shaking.</p>

	<p>"Please don't cry. We'll be fine. I won't worry so much about books or walks in the forest anymore. That kind of thing was not meant for people like me. I can see that now. People must have money in order to enjoy life."</p>

	<p>"You're wrong, there," argued Helen, "It's because we're all going to die one day. And when we do, who among us will be able to die happily? Who among us will be aware of the 'I' that is within?"</p>

	<p>"I'm not so sure that I understand," Leonard answered. He was too worried about the smaller things in his life to be able to think clearly about Helen's high-minded theories. He wanted to know if Mr Wilcox would give him a job or not. That was the biggest question burning in his brain.</p>

	<p>Just then, a server came to the table with two letters in her hand: one for Helen and one for Leonard. They were both from Margaret.</p>
