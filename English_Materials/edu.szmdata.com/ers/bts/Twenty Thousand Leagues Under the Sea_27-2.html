	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER FOUR</p>

	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">The Red Sea</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">T</span>he next day, the 30th of January, I could no longer see land. We had sailed 16,220 miles from our starting point in the Japanese Seas. We were now sailing in the Persian Gulf.</p>

	<p>I began to notice that with each passing day, Ned Land seemed to become a bit more depressed, being forced away from the delights of land that he missed so dearly. He often came to ask me where we were going, but I knew very little of the captain's plans.</p>

	<p>"We are going where our captain takes us, Master Ned."</p>

	<p>"He cannot take us far, then," said the Canadian. "The Persian Gulf has no opening. We will soon have to turn back."</p>

	<p>"Then, we will come out again, Master Land."</p>

	<p>Soon enough, we ended our journey in the Persian Gulf, and by the 7th of February, we were sailing in the Red Sea, a narrow pathway, commonly used by ships going between Europe and Asia. The Red Sea was named for its mysterious color, often appearing to be the color red.</p>

	<p>By the 9th of February, I decided that I must speak to the captain about his plans, as we would soon be forced to return to the ocean; the Red Sea had no opening into the Mediterranean Sea until years after submarine adventure.</p>

	<p>"In two days, Professor Aronnax," he explained, "we shall be in the Mediterranean Sea."</p>

	<p>"The Mediterranean!" I exclaimed.</p>

	<p>"Yes, sir, does that surprise you?"</p>

	<p>"I am surprised to hear that we will be there in two days. I do not understand how the Nautilus is able to go around the continent of Africa to arrive in the Mediterranean in two days!"</p>

	<p>"Who told you we will sail around the coast of Africa, sir?"</p>

	<p>"Well, unless the Nautilus sails on land&#151;"</p>

	<p>"Or below it, Professor Aronnax," replied Captain Nemo quietly. "There is a small piece of land separating the Red Sea from the Mediterranean Sea. I have found a small tunnel of water under this bit of land that separates Europe and Africa, which I have sailed through. I have named this tunnel, the Arabian Tunnel, which I have passed through several times. While in the Mediterranean, I noticed that several types of fish are identical in the Red Sea and the Mediterranean, realizing then that there must be a connection between the two seas. Eventually, I found this great tunnel, connecting the two seas."</p>
