	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER FORTY-FIVE</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">E</span>mma walked home, quietly thinking about the news she had just heard. When she returned home, she found Mr Knightley and Harriet sitting with her father. As she came in, Mr Knightley stood up, looking disturbed:</p>

	<p>"I would not leave without seeing you, but I have no more time, and therefore I must go now. I am going to London, to spend a few days with John and Isabella."</p>

	<p>Emma was sure Mr Knightley was still upset with her for hurting poor Miss Bates at Box Hill; he looked troubled.</p>

	<p>Mr Woodhouse then began to speak, "Dear Emma went to Mrs and Miss Bates for a visit, Mr Knightley, as I told you before. She is so caring."</p>

	<p>Mr Knightley looked at her and smiled. She knew he was no longer angry with her. He left them immediately, although he left more suddenly than usual that morning.</p>

	<p>Emma knew her father would be worried about Mr Knightley's visit to London, and wanted to keep his mind from worrying about Mr Knightley, so she told him about Jane Fairfax's new position.</p>

	<p>"I am very glad, indeed, my dear, to hear she will be with such a wonderful family. I hope they will take care of poor Jane Fairfax's health. Jane will be to this new family what Miss Taylor was to us."</p>

	<p>The following day, however, brought news from the Churchills; all other matters were forgotten. Mrs Churchill had died. Although Frank Churchill had no reason to return quickly to Highbury, he arrived within a few days of her death.</p>

	<p>Everyone felt sadness for Mrs Churchill. After being disliked by all for twenty-five years, she was now spoken quite well of by the people of Highbury.</p>

	<p>"Poor Mrs Churchill, she had suffered a great deal. What would Mr Churchill do without her? He would never get over it," Mr Weston remarked.</p>

	<p>Emma wondered how this event would affect Frank Churchill, and then realized that he would benefit greatly. She knew now that a relationship with Harriet Smith would no longer be a problem, he was free. Mr Churchill, independent of his wife, was not feared. His nephew could convince him to do almost anything. Emma just hoped that Frank would soon be interested in young Harriet.</p>

	<p>Harriet behaved extremely well on the occasion. News came that Frank Churchill and his uncle were making funeral arrangements, and were going to visit friends after. For now, there could be no plans made for Harriet and Frank Churchill; Emma had to wait.</p>

	<p>At present, Emma knew she had to show attention to Jane Fairfax, who would soon be leaving Highbury. Emma and Jane had never been friends, and Emma now felt guilty for her coldness towards Jane and for envying Jane's many talents. Emma now wanted to help Jane, and be a good friend. Emma decided to invite her to spend a day at Hartfield. However, the invitation was refused. Miss Fairfax was not well enough to go for a visit. She had terrible headaches and a high fever. Her health was terrible, and she might not go to Mrs Smallridges within two weeks' time. Emma went to the Bates' home the next morning, anyway. Miss Bates was grateful that Emma showed such concern for poor Jane, but the girl still refused to leave the house.</p>

	<p>Afterwards, Emma heard that Jane Fairfax had gone on a long walk, quite far from Highbury. She realized then that Jane would not forgive her for her coldness in the past. Emma was sorry, very sorry.</p>
