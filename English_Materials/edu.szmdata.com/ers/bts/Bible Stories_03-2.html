	<p class="storyTitle">3. Cain and Abel</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">O</span>nce Adam and Eve had made a home away from the Garden of Eden, they had their first child, a boy named Cain. Soon afterward they had another son named Abel. The two boys grew up to be very different; Abel became a shepherd. He loved and trusted God and offered a lamb as a gift to God.</p>

	<p>Cain was a farmer. He gave God a gift of corn he had grown in his fields. But Cain had much pride and stubbornness inside him.</p>

	<p>God knew what was in the heart of each brother. He accepted Abel's gift, but not Cain's. Cain became very angry with God and started to walk away from him.</p>

	<p>"Why are you so angry?" God asked. "If you would only do what's right you would be happy."</p>

	<p>Cain did not listen to God. Instead he became more angry at God and more jealous of his brother, Abel.</p>

	<p>Cain knew Abel had pleased God in a way that he seemed unable to do. Cain grew more jealous of his brother every day. Finally, he made a plan to do away with his brother. He asked Abel to walk out to the fields with him.</p>

	<p>Abel was glad that Cain wanted to be with him. He hoped they could love each other like real brothers again. His dream came to a bitter end when Cain raised his hand and hit Abel, killing him instantly. Cain walked away, leaving Abel's body in the field.</p>

	<p>"Where's your brother, Cain?" Cain heard God's voice calling to him.</p>

	<p>"How should I know?" Cain said. "It is not for me to look out for my brother all the time."</p>

	<p>But God knew what had happened and spoke again to Cain. "Your brother's blood cries out to me! You must be punished for this evil thing, Cain. Leave this land, for it will no longer grow your crops. You will wander through this world in fear from now on."</p>

	<p>Like his parents before him, Cain had disobeyed God and chosen a path that led him away from happiness.</p>
