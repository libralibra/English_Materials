	<p class="storyTitle">42. Preaching</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">J</span>esus chose twelve disciples to follow him and learn about his teachings. They were: Matthew, the tax collector, Peter, the fisherman, Andrew, John, Bartholomew, Thomas, Thaddaeus, Simon, Philip, Judas Iscariot, and two men, both named James.</p>

	<p>Jesus wanted to spend time with the disciples, but so many people wanted to hear him speak that there wasn't a building big enough to hold them. Jesus decided to go up on a mountaintop, so everyone could hear him.</p>

	<p>The things Jesus taught the people were different from things the priests taught in the synagogues. He said it was against God's commandments to kill a person, but it was also evil just to think about killing someone. He told everyone to think and behave kindly toward one another. They must be especially good, so they would set an example for unbelievers.</p>

	<p>"The person with a pure heart will be blessed," he said. "That person will see God."</p>

	<p>Jesus told the disciples that some people would criticize them for being his followers. He said they must be kind to people trying to hurt them.</p>

	<p>"Treat others the same way you would like to be treated."</p>

	<p>When Jesus told a story, he put a message in it so the disciples would understand him better. A story like this was called a parable. Jesus told a parable about two houses.</p>

	<p>"The man who believes in me is like the man who dug a deep foundation for his house. When the floods came and shook the house, it stood firm," he said.</p>

	<p>"But if a man hears me and does not believe me, he is like the man who built his house on top of the earth. He had no foundation, so when the floods came, his house washed away."</p>

	<p>He wanted the disciples to understand how important it was for them to have a solid foundation in God's laws.</p>

	<p>One day Jesus preached to a crowd by the sea. Many people gathered on shore, so he went on board a ship. He spoke to the crowd from out in the water, telling them a parable about seeds.</p>

	<p>"A man went out to plant seeds in his garden. Some seeds fell on rocks and the birds ate them. Other seeds fell on shallow soil. They sprouted but didn't live long.</p>

	<p>Some seeds fell in weeds, and their growth was choked out. But other seeds landed on rich, pure soil. Those seeds grew into many healthy plants."</p>

	<p>The people wondered what Jesus meant by his parable, but the disciples began to understand.</p>

	<p>"You are the sowers of God's word," Jesus said to the disciples. "You will spread the word to many people, but only a few will listen. They will become the fruit of God's earth." Jesus wanted to tell the people about the kingdom of heaven. He chose many other parables, such as:</p>

	<p>"The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed that is planted. It is the smallest of all seeds, but when it has grown it is the greatest of plants and becomes a tree so that the birds of the air come and make nests in its branches."</p>

	<p>"The kingdom of heaven is like yeast that a woman took and mixed in with three measures of flour until all of it was leavened."</p>

	<p>Only his disciples were explained the meanings of these parables.</p>
