	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER FIVE</p>

	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">All of England Discusses the Wager</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">P</span>hineas Fogg suspected that his departure from London would create excitement. The news created many conversations in the Reform Club, and it soon got into the papers throughout England. Some people supported Phineas Fogg, but most did not. It was impossible, they declared, that the tour of the world could be made in this short time. The Times, Standard, Morning Post, and Daily News, and twenty other highly respectable newspapers said Mr Fogg's project was foolish.</p>

	<p>Many articles were written, for geography is one of the favorite subjects of the English. Some women supported him, and Phineas Fogg became more popular when the Illustrated London News printed his portrait.</p>

	<p>Finally a long article appeared on the 7th of October. The Royal Geographical Society looked at the question from every point of view, and showed the foolishness of the plan.</p>

	<p>Everything was against the travelers. They needed a perfect agreement of the times of departure and arrival, which was impossible. It was possible in Europe, where the distances are not so long; but Phineas Fogg was going to cross India in three days, and the United States in seven. A single delay could ruin everything.</p>

	<p>The article was read by many people, and the tourist's supporters were worried.</p>

	<p>Everyone knows that England is the world of betting men. The public made large wagers for or against Phineas Fogg, like he was a race-horse. After the article, however, no one would bet for Phineas Fogg. Lord Albemarle, an old gentleman, was now the only supporter of Phineas Fogg left. He said, "If the thing is possible, the first to do it ought to be an Englishman."</p>

	<p>Everyone was going against Fogg, and the bets stood a hundred and fifty and two hundred to one. One week later an incident occurred which made him lose all his supporters.</p>

	<p>At nine o'clock one evening, the chief of police received this telegram:</p>

	<p>Suez to London.</p>

	<p>Rowan, Chief of Police, Scotland Yard:</p>

	<p>I've found the bank robber, Phineas Fogg. Send warrant of arrest to Bombay.</p>

	<p>Detective Fix.</p>

	<p>The gentleman was now a bank robber, and his picture was examined. His face matched the description of the robber perfectly. It seemed clear that the wager was made to hide his departure from the detectives.</p>
