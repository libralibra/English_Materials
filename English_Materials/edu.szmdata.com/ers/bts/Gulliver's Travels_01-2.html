	<p class="storyTitle">PART ONE: A VOYAGE TO LILUPUT</p>

	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER ONE</p>

	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">A Terrible Storm</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">M</span>y father was not a rich man, but he did have a small piece of land in a town called Nottinghamshire in England. He was lucky to marry a strong woman who gave him five healthy sons. Of these five sons, I was in the middle.</p>

	<p>My father wanted me to become a doctor, so he sent me to study in the city of Cambridge. I studied hard and became an excellent student of medicine. However, in my heart I did not wish to become a doctor, living a boring life in the city. I wanted a life of travel and adventure at sea! Fortunately, after I had been at the university for three years, I found a job as a doctor on a small trade ship. For the next two years I worked on this ship and had many exciting journeys before returning to England.</p>

	<p>When I arrived home, I bought a house and started a private business as a doctor. A half year later, I married a lovely young woman named Mary Burton. For a while, our life was quiet and simple. We had two children and lived in a small but very pleasant house.</p>

	<p>After two years of this life, I began to feel bored and unhappy. I remembered how excited I had been traveling the seas; often I would sit in my doctor's office and dream of sailing away to distant lands. Finally I discussed my dreams with my wife, and she agreed to let me take a job on a ship that traveled between England and some islands in the South Sea. During the next six years, I worked on the ship and saw many foreign lands. When I spent time in these lands, I was able to learn the people's languages and customs very easily.</p>

	<p>On May 4th, 1699, our ship left England for the South Sea. Though we had traveled there many times, this trip was different. Our captain planned to travel a new way that, he hoped, would be faster and save us many days. However, I did not know it, this trip would change my life!</p>

	<p>For a while, the weather at sea was calm and warm. However, when we were near the west coast of Australia, our ship ran into the worst storm I had ever seen. The sky grew black and thunder and lightning were in the clouds. The wind and waves threw the ship back and forth violently. Then a great wave hit us and made a large hole in the side of the ship. I knew if we did not leave the ship immediately, we would all sink into the water.</p>

	<p>Five other men and I got onto one of the small boats we were carrying and rowed as hard as we could. We did not know where we were going, but I prayed that somehow we would find land. But the storm continued, and after two hours, we were so tired that we could not row the boat any longer. I felt sure we would die. Suddenly a great wave turned our boat over, and all six of us were thrown into the sea! I swam as hard as I could to stay above the water. Soon I could not see my friends. I suppose that they all must have died that terrible day, but I was so scared that I did not think about them.</p>

	<p>My arms fought the terrible waves for what seemed like hours. I grew tired, and my head fell under the water many times. I was afraid some awful sea creature would see my weak body in the water and decide to eat me! I was about to let myself sink into the water and die, when suddenly I felt my feet touch the ground!</p>

	<p>I looked ahead of me through the rain and saw a beach with many trees. Although the tall waves threw me against some sharp rocks many times, I managed to make it onto the beach. I sat down and thanked God for saving my life. But where was I?</p>
