	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER FORTY-FIVE</p>

	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">Forgiveness</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">W</span>ell Halford, what do you think of this story? I could not sleep tonight, as I spend the entire night reading this story of my dear Helen. I did not finish reading until nearly eight o'clock in the morning. Shortly after breakfast, I returned to Wildfell Hall to return my dear Helen's journal and ask her to forgive me for my terrible behaviour the night before.</p>

	<p>As I walked into the sitting room, she turned to me and spoke.</p>

	<p>"Have you read my journal?"</p>

	<p>"I've read it," I said, "and want to know if you'll forgive me&#151;if you can forgive me?"</p>

	<p>She was silent, crying as she looked out the window, but soon spoke.</p>

	<p>"Can you forgive me?"</p>

	<p>I gently placed her hand in mine.</p>

	<p>"You should have told me earlier," I said quietly.</p>

	<p>"Now, Gilbert, you must leave me, and never come again."</p>

	<p>"Never again, Helen? I love you! How can I leave you?"</p>

	<p>"For that reason. I will soon leave this place, as soon as I find another safe place to hide from my husband. If we continue to meet, it will be even more difficult to part. So, you must not come again."</p>

	<p>"I'll do whatever you desire, but please don't say that this is our last meeting!"</p>

	<p>"Why not? Every time we meet, the thoughts of our last meeting will become more painful."</p>

	<p>"But, we may write," I suggested quietly.</p>

	<p>"We can hear of each other through my brother."</p>

	<p>"Your brother!" I soon remembered what pain I had caused him and felt ashamed, but I did not have the courage to tell her. "Your brother will not help us."</p>

	<p>"And he is right. We should forget each other. But don't be afraid, Gilbert. You should marry, and find happiness. You are still young."</p>

	<p>"And you are young too, Helen. I'll wait for you."</p>

	<p>She refused to accept this. Mr Huntingdon may live for many, many years, and I must not waste my life waiting for her.</p>

	<p>She soon added, "Frederick shall inform you in six months of my location. If you still have these feelings, then you may write, and I will answer you."</p>

	<p>"Six months!"</p>

	<p>"Yes, and now you must leave me," she said with a sad look.</p>

	<p>And we parted, but I hope not forever.</p>

	<p>I then returned home, thinking of how to apologise to poor Mr Lawrence. Later that afternoon, I went to see him. He was quite surprised at my arrival, and feared that I might again cause him pain.</p>

	<p>"Lawrence, I made a mistake, and I have come to apologise to you. I regret what I have done to you. I had heard you speaking to her one night, and mistakenly thought you were lovers. I did not know you were Mrs Graham's brother."</p>

	<p>"Well, you are forgiven. Now, did you mention this incident to my sister?"</p>

	<p>"No, I did not have the courage to tell her, but when you tell her, will you say that I regret&#151;"</p>

	<p>"Do not fear, I shall say nothing."</p>

	<p>I left him shortly after, and we were friends once again.</p>
