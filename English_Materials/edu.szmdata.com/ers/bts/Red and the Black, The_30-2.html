	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER THIRTY</p>

	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">A Man of Ambition</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">M</span>arquis de la Mole welcomed Father Pirard in a friendly way. He was busy with politics, and he was trying to become a Duke. "I have no time to deal with my important business. Finding good help in Paris is very hard. Will you be my secretary? I'll pay you a great salary."</p>

	<p>Father Pirard said, "No, thank you. I do know someone, though. He was a student of mine, and he is very smart."</p>

	<p>"What is his background?" Marquis de la Mole asked.</p>

	<p>"They say he is a worker's son, but I'm not sure. He received an anonymous letter giving him some money."</p>

	<p>"Oh," the marquis replied. "You mean Julien Sorel."</p>

	<p>The priest was astonished. "How do you know his name?"</p>

	<p>"It's not important. I will offer him the job right away."</p>

	<p>"Good, but although his family is of low class, he has a lot of pride. If you treat him like a servant, he'll be useless," the priest warned.</p>

	<p>"Then I will make him my son's friend," was the marquis' answer.</p>

	<p>Julien left the school immediately and went to visit Fouqu&#x00E9;. Fouqu&#xE9; was surprised, but worried. "They'll make you do something bad, and the newspapers will learn. You can earn better money here," the liberal warned.</p>

	<p>The next day Julien arrived in Verri&#x00E8;res. He had lunch with Father Ch&#x00E9;lan, who was not happy to see him. Julien left and found a peasant. He borrowed a ladder from the peasant and went to Mr de R&#x00EA;nal's home.</p>

	<p>It was dark when he arrived. Julien put the ladder up to the window he knew, and he climbed up. There was no light in the window, so he knocked and whispered, "It's a friend." I must be careful, he thought. If it's the wrong person, I might be shot.</p>

	<p>The window opened and he saw a woman. It was Mrs de R&#x00EA;nal, and she was very angry. "You horrible man!" she yelled. "What are you doing?"</p>

	<p>"I have been away for fourteen months," he said. "I want to know everything that has happened."</p>

	<p>"No! You get out! I don't care if you are discovered!"</p>

	<p>Julien was hurt. "Is it possible? Is it possible you don't love me anymore?"</p>

	<p>Julien wept. After some time, he said, "Please tell me what has been happening to you."</p>

	<p>"Everyone knew about us," she said. "We were not careful at all. Father Ch&#xE9;lan talked to me, and eventually he asked me about you. I told him the truth. I was so sad that all I did was sit in my room and write you letters. Father Ch&#x00E9;lan sent some to you, but you never replied."</p>

	<p>"I never got your letters, I promise."</p>

	<p>She continued, "My husband never loved me like I thought you loved me."</p>

	<p>Julien was filled with love, and he tried to hold her. She pushed him away.</p>

	<p>"Tell me all about the school. Then you'll have to leave."</p>

	<p>Julien told her about his horrible life at the school. He slowly put his hand around her waist. She did not push him away, but she was still cold. Julien thought, if she throws me out, I'll be ashamed! I have one last chance.</p>

	<p>Julien told her about the offer in Paris. "I am leaving soon," he said. "I am leaving forever."</p>

	<p>Mrs de R&#x00EA;nal broke out into tears and fell into Julien's arms. For the last two hours, Julien had wanted her to act this way, but instead she was cold. Now in the third hour, Julien won her over with skill, not with love. Julien felt great pleasure.</p>

	<p>Julien lit a light so he could see her, and they were together all night.</p>

	<p>In the morning Julien was filled with his love, and he asked to stay in the room all day. She agreed. "Why not? I have already ruined myself."</p>

	<p>Mrs de R&#x00EA;nal put the ladder outside the room, and went to find a place to hide it. When she returned the ladder was gone. Mrs de R&#x00EA;nal should have been alarmed, but she could only think of the next night when Julien would leave. Her life would have only regret. She knew she would have to kill herself.</p>

	<p>Julien was worried, but Mrs de R&#x00EA;nal showed no fear. She brought some food during the day, and that evening she dismissed Elisa and brought more food. Julien loved her more than ever. She was not used to hiding like this, but she had real courage.</p>

	<p>There was a knock at the door, and Julien jumped under the sofa. It was Mr de R&#x00EA;nal. Mr de R&#x00EA;nal said, "Why was the door locked? You're still dressed, and you're eating? What's going on?"</p>

	<p>She said she had a headache, and he left. Later he returned, banging on the door, "There's a thief in the house! One of the servants found his ladder! Open this door immediately!"</p>

	<p>Mrs de R&#x00EA;nal fell into Julien's arms. "It's the end!" she said. "He'll kill us both! If I am going to die, I want to die with you." She kissed him with every bit of her love.</p>

	<p>"You have young children, so you must live," he said. "I'll jump into the garden and escape. You must throw my clothes to me."</p>

	<p>"You'll be killed when you jump!" was all she could reply.</p>

	<p>Julien jumped down, took his clothes, and ran towards the river. He heard a bullet whistle by his ear, and at the same time he heard a gunshot. Julien turned and ran another direction, and he heard more shots from the garden. Soon he reached the river and he put on his clothes. In an hour he was on his way to the city of Geneva in Switzerland. They won't think to look for me in another country, he thought.</p>
