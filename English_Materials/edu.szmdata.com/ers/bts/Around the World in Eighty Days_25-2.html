	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE</p>

	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">A Little Is Seen of San Francisco</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">A</span>t seven in the morning, Mr Fogg, Aouda, and Passepartout set foot in America. Passepartout was so happy that they had reached America that he decided to do some acrobatics. The wood on the docks was not strong, though, and he fell through them.</p>

	<p>Mr Fogg went to find out what time the first train left for New York. He learned that this was at six o'clock p.m. He had a whole day to spend in the city of San Francisco. He and Aouda took a carriage, and they left for the International Hotel.</p>

	<p>Passepartout looked out at the city, and he saw many low houses, buses, and churches. He saw not only Americans and Europeans, but also Chinese and Indians. Passepartout was surprised. He had heard stories about San Francisco, and he thought it would be full of thieves and robbers. Instead he saw many gentlemen in black coats.</p>

	<p>When Passepartout reached the hotel, it did not seem that he had left England.</p>

	<p>After breakfast, Mr Fogg and Aouda left to go to the English consulate. Passepartout asked if they should buy some guns. He had been listening to stories of attacks on trains by the Sioux and Pawnees, two tribes of American Indians. Mr Fogg thought it was useless, but he told Passepartout to do what he thought was best.</p>

	<p>He soon met Fix. The detective seemed very surprised. Fix said that he was happy to see Mr Fogg. His business had asked him to return to Europe, and so he asked if he could continue the journey with Mr Fogg. Mr Fogg agreed, and the detective walked with him around San Francisco.</p>

	<p>They soon came to Montgomery Street, which was full of people. Men were carrying large posters, and people were crying out.</p>

	<p>"Hurrah for Camerfield!"</p>

	<p>"Hurrah for Mandiboy!"</p>

	<p>It was a political meeting, Fix thought. "Perhaps we should avoid this crowd. There might be danger."</p>

	<p>"Yes," said Mr Fogg, "and fighting, even if it's political fighting, is still fighting."</p>

	<p>Fix smiled, and they went up some stairs to get a better look. On the other side of the street was a large platform, and the crowd was looking at it.</p>

	<p>For what purpose was this meeting? Phineas Fogg could not imagine. Was it to choose a high official?</p>

	<p>At this moment there was movement in the crowd. All the hands were raised in the air&#151;some sort of vote was taking place. The crowd moved again, and all the signs and flags disappeared.</p>

	<p>"It is a meeting," said Fix, "and it must be about something exciting."</p>

	<p>"Perhaps," replied Mr Fogg, simply.</p>

	<p>"At least, there are two champions here together, Mr Camerfield and Mr Mandiboy."</p>

	<p>Mr Fix asked a man near him what the cause of it all was. Before the man could reply, some new trouble started. Cries and shouts were heard; the poles of the signs and flags were used as weapons. Boots and shoes went flying through the air, and Mr Fogg thought he heard the sound of a gun.</p>

	<p>"It would be good for us to leave," said Fix. He didn't want Mr Fogg to be hurt before they reached London.</p>

	<p>Mr Fogg could not say anything; a new group of people were coming through, shouting, "Hurrah for Mandiboy!"</p>

	<p>Mr Fogg, Aouda, and Fix found themselves between two groups of voters, and it was too late to escape. Phineas Fogg and Fix tried to protect their companion. A big man with a red beard raised his fist to hit Mr Fogg. It would have been a crushing blow, but Fix rushed in and took it himself. A large bruise immediately formed under his hat.</p>

	<p>"Yankee!" shouted Mr Fogg, looking at the big man.</p>

	<p>"Englishman!" the other said. "We will meet again!"</p>

	<p>"When you please."</p>

	<p>"What is your name?"</p>

	<p>"Phineas Fogg. And yours?"</p>

	<p>"Colonel Stamp Proctor."</p>

	<p>The crowd moved on. Luckily, Fix was not badly hurt.</p>

	<p>"Thanks," said Mr Fogg, as soon as they were out of the crowd.</p>

	<p>"No thanks are necessary," replied Fix, "but let us go."</p>

	<p>"Where?"</p>

	<p>"To a tailor's. Our clothes are ruined."</p>

	<p>After they bought new clothes, they returned with Aouda to the hotel. Passepartout had bought six new guns. When he saw Fix, he was ready to fight, but Aouda told him what happened. Fix was no longer an enemy, it seemed.</p>

	<p>After dinner, they left for the train. Mr Fogg said to Fix, "You have not seen this Colonel Proctor again?"</p>

	<p>"No."</p>

	<p>"I will come back to America to find him," said Phineas Fogg coldly. "It would not be right for an Englishman to allow someone to treat him this badly."</p>

	<p>The train was ready to go. Mr Fogg called a porter, and said to him, "My friend, was there some trouble today in San Francisco?"</p>

	<p>"It was a political meeting, sir," replied the porter.</p>

	<p>"The election of some high official?" asked Mr Fogg.</p>

	<p>"No, sir, of a judge."</p>

	<p>Phineas Fogg got into the train, which started off at full speed.</p>
