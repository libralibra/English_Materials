	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER THIRTY-THREE</p>

	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">Two Evenings</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">S</span>eventh&#151;Yes, I will hope! Tonight, I heard Grimsby and Hattersley complaining together about Arthur, and his recent disinterest in being careless and wild.</p>

	<p>"I thought he wouldn't act uncivilly for long, but I thought our Mrs Huntingdon would have to threaten to make us leave. I didn't think he would stop this wild behaviour this way," Mr Hattersley told him.</p>

	<p>"But, he'll change again when he's tired of her. If we come here in a year or two, we shall be merry and wild again," Grimsby said.</p>

	<p>"I don't know," replied Hattersley, "she's not the style of woman you soon get tired of."</p>

	<p>As I left the room, I smiled at them, and walked out to find my husband. I found him walking outside. I put my arms around him and kissed his cheek. He smiled, then looked at me with a look of shocking astonishment.</p>

	<p>"Helen! What are you doing out here?"</p>

	<p>"I scared you?" I asked him with a laugh, "How nervous you are!"</p>

	<p>"Go back inside, Helen, you'll soon be ill if you stay out here."</p>

	<p>"I have to tell you something. They are blaming you, Arthur, for refusing to drink and becoming wild, but I want to thank you. I hope you will continue with this new behaviour, and I will love you even more!"</p>

	<p>"Well, well, I will! Now go in the house, quickly, or you'll be ill!" he said anxiously.</p>

	<p>That evening, I was quite content with my husband, and rather friendly with the guests, even Lady Lowborough.</p>

	<p>9th&#151;Yesterday, when Rachel came to assist me in dressing for dinner, she looked quite upset. She had been crying.</p>

	<p>"What is the matter, Rachel? Why have you been crying?" I asked her.</p>

	<p>"Well, Ma'am, I don't like Mr Huntingdon's behaviour," she paused, "You should be careful about that Lady Lowborough. If I were you, I would not allow her to be in this house any longer!"</p>

	<p>I was shocked. At that moment, Milicent entered my room. At dinner, I watched my husband and Lady Lowborough quite carefully, but noticed no strange behaviour. After dinner, Mr Hargrave came to me, looking quite anxious.</p>

	<p>"May I tell you something, Mrs Huntingdon?" he asked, without looking at me.</p>

	<p>"If it is important, please do tell me."</p>

	<p>"Do you notice that Annabella is not nearby? And have you also noticed that Mr Huntingdon has also disappeared?"</p>

	<p>"Well?" I asked impatiently.</p>

	<p>"They've gone outside together, where you found your husband outside last night."</p>

	<p>Without a word, I stood up and walked quickly outside. Soon enough, I found them near a few trees in the yard, hidden from view. I silently walked near them, without them hearing me move.</p>

	<p>"Ah, Huntingdon!" I heard Lady Lowborough say. "It was here you kissed your wife, that silly woman!"</p>

	<p>"Well, dearest, I must not upset her. I have certainly seen you kiss your foolish husband, but I never complain," my husband said to her!</p>

	<p>"But, you don't love her, not even a little?" she asked, as she smiled at him.</p>

	<p>"Not even a little bit," he replied, as he kissed her cheek.</p>

	<p>She then ran back to the house, and he soon followed. I was too shocked and hurt to move. After a short time, I returned to the house. How could I bear my future life? I walked into the dark, empty dining room, where all was silent. As the guests were returning to their rooms to sleep, I opened the door just as Arthur was walking by. I asked him to come into the dining room.</p>

	<p>"Helen, what is the matter with you? You look ill?" he asked, looking annoyed that I bothered him.</p>

	<p>"No matter," I answered, "since you no longer love me, I no longer love you," I paused, "I would leave you tomorrow if I did not have our child to care for."</p>

	<p>"Helen, what is the matter with you? What are you speaking of?"</p>

	<p>"You know. I saw you tonight outside with someone else," I said coldly.</p>

	<p>He was silent.</p>

	<p>"Well!&#151;What then?" he asked angrily.</p>

	<p>"Will you let me take our child and the rest of my fortune and leave?"</p>

	<p>"No, of course not!"</p>

	<p>"Well, will you let me have the child then, without the money?"</p>

	<p>"No&#151;nor yourself without the child. Do you think I want to look like a fool&#151;left by my wife! No, you may not leave!"</p>

	<p>"Then I must stay here to be hated. But, I will never again love you as a wife loves a husband."</p>

	<p>"Very good."</p>

	<p>"So, do not pretend to love me any longer, I cannot bear it."</p>

	<p>"Very good, my lady."</p>
