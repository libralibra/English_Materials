	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER SEVEN</p>

	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">Sad News</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">A</span>fter the Houyhnhnms' Great Meeting, my life on the island got even better. I had been living with the grey horse and his family, but one day my master gave me a little house of my own. It looked just like the other Houyhnhnms' houses. I made beds and chairs for my house from weeds and grasses, and lived a very comfortable life. Eventually, of course, my old clothes were completely destroyed, so I made myself new clothes out of rabbit skins. Every day I ate bread, milk, and herbs, but often I would hunt for rabbits or small birds to eat. I was happier than I had ever been before, living my simple life with the great and wonderful Houyhnhnms. I loved them so much that I decided never to leave the island. I knew that I could never live with human beings again, they were too savage and stupid. I was even happier living here than in the city of Nottingham with my wife and children!</p>

	<p>I knew that as long as I lived here, I would never experience greed, jealousy, or unkindness, as I had in the lands of Lilliput and Brobdingnag. There were no wars and corruption, like there were in England and Europe. I had lived with the Houyhnhnms so long that my own people seemed like Yahoos to me! I respected the Houyhnhnms so much, that my greatest dream was to be like them.</p>

	<p>Sometimes, when other Houyhnhnms came to visit my master, I was allowed to sit in the room and listen to their conversation, which made me very happy. I would never speak to one of these great Houyhnhnms unless they spoke to me first. I was happy to be able to answer any of their questions, and I hoped that the more time I spent with the Houyhnhnms, the more like them I might become. When the Houyhnhnms spoke together, they never argued or interrupted each other. Everyone was always polite and listened happily to everyone else. Often, instead of speaking, they would sit quietly together for a while. I admired this very much.</p>

	<p>I had been on the island for more than two years and thought that I had everything I needed. One day, my master sent for me. "I have something I must tell you," he said to me.</p>

	<p>I was worried because his voice sounded different than usual. "What is it, Master?" I asked.</p>

	<p>My master looked uncomfortable. "I have spoken with the other leaders of the country," he said, "I do not know how you will react to what I am going to say, so please be calm. Do you remember the Great Meeting you saw about a year ago? We discussed the problem of the Yahoos for several days. However, there was something I did not tell you. The leaders were very upset that I kept you, a Yahoo, in my house, and gave you our food to eat. Now, you have your own house and spend time with many Houyhnhnms. The leaders feel that I am treating you like a Houyhnhnm, instead of a Yahoo. I talk to you often, and the other leaders do not believe that talking with a Yahoo is a pleasant or useful thing to do. The leaders believe that these actions are not reasonable. I have been asked to make you a servant like the other Yahoos in this country. However, I do not want to do that, because I have learned that you are different from them. So, I must order you to leave here. You must go back to your own country and never return here again."</p>

	<p>I cried out in sadness and immediately fainted. When I woke up a few minutes later, I began to cry terribly. I could not believe that I had to return to my country! I thought of my own people as dirty, stupid Yahoos, and I did not want to live with them ever again. However, I had no choice but to leave.</p>

	<p>In a few weeks, I had built a small boat from some trees that had recently died and had all the food and other supplies I needed. I was ready to leave the land of the Houyhnhnms. I said goodbye to my master and his family with tears in my eyes. Then I got in my canoe and began the journey back to my own land. I was so unhappy that I wanted to die!</p>
