	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER TWENTY-NINE</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">W</span>hen I woke up, I was lying on thick blankets. My uncle was watching over me. He then took my hand and shouted for joy.</p>

	<p>"He's alive! He's alive!"</p>

	<p>"Yes," I said weakly.</p>

	<p>"You're saved, my dear boy!" my uncle said, holding me in his arms.</p>

	<p>I was overjoyed to be with my uncle again. Just then, Hans arrived. I saw a smile on his face.</p>

	<p>"God dag," he said.</p>

	<p>"Good day, Hans, good day," I said. "Now, uncle, where are we?"</p>

	<p>"Tomorrow, Axel. I'll tell you tomorrow. Right now, you must rest. Go to sleep, my boy, and tomorrow I'll tell you everything."</p>

	<p>"Please, at least, tell me what time it is and what day."</p>

	<p>"It's eleven o'clock at night on Sunday, August 9."</p>

	<p>I really was very weak still. I needed a good night's rest. I went to sleep after discovering that I had been alone in the dark passage for three long days.</p>

	<p>When I woke up the next morning, I saw that my uncle and Hans had given me all the blankets we had brought. It was only half dark, but none of the lanterns were being used. I could not explain where the light came from. I then heard the sound of the ocean again.</p>

	<p>I wondered if, perhaps, I was dreaming. But no, I was not. That's really daylight coming through the rock! And I really hear the sound of the ocean. Are we still inside the Earth, or has my uncle had us return to the surface? Just then, my uncle came over to me, and said cheerfully, "Good morning, Axel. I believe you're feeling well again!"</p>

	<p>"Yes, I am," I said, sitting up.</p>

	<p>"I thought so, since you slept so well. Hans watched over you for part of the night, and I watched over you for the other part. We could actually see you getting better."</p>

	<p>"It's true. I feel much better again. So, let's eat breakfast!"</p>

	<p>"Don't worry, you'll have something to eat. You no longer have a fever. Hans put some secret Icelandic medicine on your wounds, and they're already gone. He's a good man."</p>

	<p>He was preparing breakfast as he spoke. I ate quickly, and asked him many questions as I ate. I discovered that I had fallen into a deep hole, and I had landed in my uncle's arms, who rescued me from the falling rocks.</p>

	<p>"It's amazing that you weren't killed by those falling rocks," my uncle told me. "Now, let's not get separated again for the rest of the journey."</p>

	<p>I looked at him with great surprise.</p>

	<p>"What's the matter, Axel?"</p>

	<p>"So, our trip is not over?"</p>

	<p>"Of course not," my uncle responded.</p>

	<p>"Are you sure there is nothing wrong with my head? You say that I am quite healthy now, but I believe there is something wrong in my brain."</p>

	<p>"Why?"</p>

	<p>"Because I see daylight and hear the sound of an ocean."</p>

	<p>"Oh, you'll see that tomorrow. I want you to rest today. The wind is far too strong for you today. You'll rest today, then we'll sail across the water tomorrow."</p>

	<p>"Sail?"</p>

	<p>I was too curious to wait till the next day to see this mysterious place. I wrapped myself in a blanket, and my uncle took me to see it.</p>
