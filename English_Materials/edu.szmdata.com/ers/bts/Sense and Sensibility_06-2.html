	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER SIX</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">T</span>he first part of the journey was filled with sadness, however, they began to look forward to seeing their new home, away from their insensitive sister-in-law, who caused them a great deal of pain.</p>

	<p>Barton Cottage was quite small, but still comfortable and charming. In comparison with Norland, it was poor and small, indeed, but the four women appeared to look excited about their new home.</p>

	<p>The next morning, soon after breakfast, Sir John Middleton arrived for a visit. He was a good-looking man of about forty, quite friendly and helpful. He insisted that they dine at his home until they were fully moved into their new home. After he left, a large basket full of garden vegetables and fruit arrived, and later in the day, a present of meat came, all from Sir Middleton, to welcome them.</p>

	<p>Mrs Dashwood was rather satisfied with the size and furniture of the house, although she planned to do many additions to the house in the future.</p>

	<p>"As for the house itself, to be sure," said she, "it is too small for our family, but we will make ourselves comfortable for the present, as it is too late in the year for improvements. Perhaps in the spring if I have plenty of money, we shall improve the house."</p>

	<p>In the meantime, till all the improvements could be made from the savings of an income of five hundred pounds a year by a woman who never saved in her life, the family was wise enough to be content with the house as it was.</p>

	<p>Lady Middleton soon sent a polite message to Mrs Dashwood requesting to visit her new neighbors when they were settled in their new home. Mrs Dashwood immediately sent a message back, and the five women met the next day.</p>

	<p>The Dashwoods were quite anxious to meet the high-class Lady Middleton. In fact, she was elegant with excellent manners. She was a beauty of nearly twenty-seven, quite graceful and tall. Her manners were much more graceful than her husband's, indeed, although the Dashwood women noticed that she was quite cold, and had nothing to say for herself aside from common greetings. Although her husband lacked her grace and elegance, he was a warm and friendly man.</p>
