	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">C</span>olonel Brandon visited them nearly every day. He came to look at Marianne and talk to Elinor, who was always quite pleased to make conversation with him, but was also worried to see him watch her sister with such love.</p>

	<p>About a week after their arrival, the girls returned late in the morning with Mrs Jennings after visiting friends. Marianne quickly noticed that Willoughby had, during their outing, come for a visit.</p>

	<p>"Good God!" cried Marianne. "He has been here while we were out." Elinor was delighted to see that Willoughby was, indeed, in London again.</p>

	<p>"Marianne, he will surely come again tomorrow for a visit," she told her sister. Elinor was content that he had come, and Marianne's confidence in Willoughby's love for herself had returned. The next morning, Marianne insisted on staying home while the others went out, hoping Willoughby would return.</p>

	<p>Later in the day, a letter was brought to the house; Marianne took it immediately, supposing it was from Willoughby. Unfortunately, it was a letter for Mrs Jennings from Lady Middleton, announcing that their family had arrived the night before in London. Lady Middleton wished for them to go for a visit the next evening, which they agreed to.</p>

	<p>Sir John, in the two days since he arrived in town, managed to invite twenty young people over for a dinner party and dance. Lady Middleton was rather bothered, as such unprepared parties were acceptable in the country, but events in London must be planned, as she must continue to be considered elegant and high-class.</p>

	<p>Marianne was rather annoyed to have to be at the party without her Willoughby. She became more upset after discovering that Sir John had seen Willoughby, and invited him to the gathering. Willoughby, however, had politely refused.</p>

	<p>The next morning, Elinor decided that she must write to her mother to explain the situation. In the letter, she begged her mother to demand that Marianne tell her the true situation with Willoughby. After finishing the letter, Colonel Brandon arrived for a visit. Marianne saw him coming from the window and left the room.</p>

	<p>"Your sister looks unwell today," he began. After a pause, he continued, congratulating her on gaining a brother. Elinor was shocked and confused. He tried to smile as he spoke, "Your sister's engagement to Mr Willoughby is well-known by all."</p>

	<p>"It cannot be well-known; I do not even know."</p>

	<p>He looked surprised, and said, "I'm sorry, my comment was quite impolite, but I did not believe there was any secret, as their marriage is often spoken of. Mrs Jennings, the Middletons and the Palmers all speak of it. Mrs Jennings' own servant was talking about it, as she often delivers letters to Willoughby from your sister."</p>

	<p>Elinor was silent, shocked that Colonel Brandon knew more about her sister's love affair than herself. She saw how painful this visit was for Colonel Brandon, as he would now never succeed in winning Marianne's love.</p>

	<p>"I wish your sister all the happiness in the world, and wish for Willoughby to one day deserve her love," he said before quickly leaving.</p>

	<p>Elinor was quite upset after such a meeting with the Colonel. She pitied him for his pain and suffering, though she knew Marianne would be delighted to hear such news.</p>
