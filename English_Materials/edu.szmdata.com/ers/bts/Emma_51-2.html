	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER FIFTY-ONE</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">E</span>mma had been upset with Frank Churchill's behaviour, but after reading his emotional letter, particularly where she herself was mentioned, Emma had to forgive him. She decided that Mr Knightley must read the letter as well.</p>

	<p>"I shall be very glad to look it over," said he. When he read the part about Miss Woodhouse, he read it out loud, smiling with contentment. "He played a dangerous game with your heart. How could he think you knew his secret?"</p>

	<p>Mr Knightley made several remarks as he read through the letter. After he finished reading, he spoke again:</p>

	<p>"It is true that he's made many mistakes. I do agree that he is happier than he deserves, but he is quite in love with Miss Fairfax. And now, I must speak to you about something else." He then began speaking to her about how they could marry without breaking her father's heart. She immediately told him that while her dear father was alive, she could never leave him. Mr Knightley knew this was true. He had been thinking of what to do all day. At first, he thought Mr Woodhouse would agree to move to his comfortable home, but he realized that Mr Woodhouse could not bear to leave his home. Mr Woodhouse could only be content at Hartfield, and so Mr Knightley decided he could be content at Hartfield, as well.</p>

	<p>Emma had, as well, been thinking of the possibility of moving to Mr Knightley's home, but realized it was impossible. She had not thought of his suggestion of his moving to Hartfield. She felt that, in leaving his home, he was giving up a great deal, and that with no home of his own, Mr Woodhouse, with his odd behaviour, would greatly upset Mr Knightley. However, he told her that he had already decided. He had thought about it with calm consideration. She promised to think of it.</p>

	<p>The more Emma thought of Mr Knightley's moving to Hartfield, the more pleasing it became. She was almost in perfect happiness until she thought of poor Harriet. In time, Harriet would forget Mr Knightley, but it would be difficult. Mr Knightley, always a caring gentleman, would be difficult to forget.</p>
