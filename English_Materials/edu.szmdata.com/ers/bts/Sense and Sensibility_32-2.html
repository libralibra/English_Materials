	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER THIRTY-TWO</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">E</span>linor soon told her sister the shocking story. Marianne listened silently, at times unable to believe what she was hearing. After some time, however, Marianne accepted the story to be true, but she did not feel better after discovering Willoughby's true character. Marianne no longer avoided meeting Colonel Brandon, and now spoke to him with respect and tenderness.</p>

	<p>Mrs Dashwood immediately sent a letter to comfort her daughter. Her mother believed that, perhaps, staying in London might be better for her suffering daughter, as she had many friends there, as well as several more activities to take part in than in the country. Although, such a suggestion greatly pained her, as she sincerely wished to see her daughters, and to comfort Marianne.</p>

	<p>After the Middletons and the Palmers discovered the news of Willoughby's engagement to Miss Grey, they were all quite shocked and disappointed in his behavior. Sir John declared that he would no longer invite the young man along for hunting outings, though he was one of the best riders in England, or so John believed.</p>

	<p>Lady Middleton showed her astonishment by remarking nearly twice a day what a shock the news was. However, she had discovered that Miss Grey was quite an elegant, high-class woman, just as she was, and decided to know her better after she was married to Willoughby.</p>

	<p>Mrs Palmer was just as angry as her mother, and promised that she would tell everyone she met what a cheating young man he was. She wished, as well, that her country home were not near his.</p>

	<p>Early in February, within two weeks from receiving Willoughby's letter, Elinor was forced to tell her sister that Willoughby was, indeed, married. At first, Marianne said nothing, and did not look disturbed after hearing the news. After a short time, however, she burst into tears. Elinor knew that she had to tell Marianne, although it would cause her a great deal of pain, as finding out another way would be more painful. The Willoughbys left London immediately after their wedding, which greatly relieved Elinor, as she would no longer have to worry about Marianne seeing him while in town.</p>

	<p>About this time, the two Miss Steeles arrived at their cousin's home. Elinor was sorry to see them. Their presence always gave her pain.</p>

	<p>"I am surprised to find you in town still," Lucy said, referring to Marianne's surprising meeting with Willoughby. She supposed the Dashwoods would leave immediately after Marianne discovered that Willoughby was engaged to another. Elinor disregarded Lucy's rude comment, however.</p>

	<p>"We traveled with quite a handsome man, Dr Davies. He certainly behaved like a gentleman," her sister said with a smile.</p>

	<p>"Oh!" cried Mrs Jennings, "The doctor is a single man, you should remember."</p>

	<p>"Oh, everyone laughs at me about the doctor, but I do not know why. My cousins say the doctor is interested in me, but I do not believe so," Miss Anne Steele said, enjoying the attention.</p>

	<p>"How charming that Mrs Dashwood has allowed you to be gone for so long time!" Lucy said to Elinor.</p>

	<p>"Long time, indeed!" interrupted Mrs Jennings. "Their visit is just beginning!"</p>

	<p>Lucy was silenced.</p>

	<p>"I am sorry we cannot see your sister, Miss Dashwood," said Miss Anne Steele. "I am sorry she is not well." Marianne had left the room as they arrived.</p>

	<p>"Thank you. I'm sure my sister is upset she cannot see you both, as well. She has been rather ill lately and must rest."</p>

	<p>"Oh dear, what a pity! We are such good friends! I think she might see us. Perhaps we could go into her room for a minute to greet her. Let us go in for just a moment to see her," insisted Miss Steele.</p>

	<p>Elinor was surprised at such an impolite request, and again politely declined.</p>
