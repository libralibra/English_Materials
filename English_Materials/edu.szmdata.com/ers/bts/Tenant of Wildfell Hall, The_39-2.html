	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER THIRTY-NINE</p>

	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">A Plan of Escape</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">M</span>y worries are about my son. His father and his father's friends often teach him his father's bad habits, and encourage him. I attempt to keep my son away from them as long as possible, but Mr Huntingdon often calls his son to the dinner table after the men have finished eating. They find the boy quite amusing when he takes wine with them and uses the terrible words his father teaches him. My son finds this time entertaining, as well, and cries when I force him to leave them. I am thankful that Mr Hargrave does not encourage the child. I have never seen him laugh at the child's behaviour.</p>

	<p>I can no longer allow my dear son to follow his father's habits. Therefore, I must leave soon with my son. For now, I must continue to improve my painting talent. I will then explain my plan to Rachel. She will find a picture dealer, who can sell my paintings, and I will save the money for the journey and to find a new home for my son and me. I worked from morning till evening on my paintings, alone in the library. At times, Mr Hargrave would come to visit for a short time, but I said little to him, and he would soon leave. One evening, however, he came in, telling me he had something important to say.</p>

	<p>"Your husband was speaking about you this evening, Mrs Huntingdon," he paused, waiting for my response, but I said nothing, so he continued, "Mr Huntingdon told us tonight that he, indeed, has no wife, and will gladly give you to anyone who asks. What do you think of this news, Mrs Huntingdon?"</p>

	<p>"I will no longer be his possession."</p>

	<p>"Will you leave him, then?"</p>

	<p>"Yes, but my child will go with me."</p>

	<p>"Alone! You cannot go alone!" he exclaimed as he walked towards me. "Mrs Huntingdon, you are cruel to me. I must speak!" he cried. "You must allow me to leave with you! Let me protect you!"</p>

	<p>"Never! I will never allow you to leave with us!"</p>

	<p>Soon enough, Grimsby walked by, looking into the library at the two of us. Immediately, my husband, Hattersley, and Grimsby came into the room. Mr Hargrave was smiling with satisfaction.</p>

	<p>"Mr Hargrave," I said coldly, "please tell these gentlemen that I did not refuse your requests to become my lover."</p>

	<p>He turned around and looked at me in surprise.</p>

	<p>"No, you did not," he said quietly, looking down.</p>

	<p>I immediately left them. What a scene! How could I bear such embarrassment in my own home!</p>

	<p>Mr Hargrave left Grassdale early the next morning, and I have never seen him since. The others stayed for two or three weeks longer, but I spent little time with them. I worked all day in the library on my paintings. Soon, I explained my plan of escape to Rachel. She hates Mr Huntingdon strongly, and loves my son and I like a mother. She offered me her savings, but of course I could not accept. I will complete my paintings and save enough money to leave with my child, leaving my husband alone with his bottle of wine.</p>
