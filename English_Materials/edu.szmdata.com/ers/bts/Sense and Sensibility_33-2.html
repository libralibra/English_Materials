	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER THIRTY-THREE</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">O</span>ne morning, Elinor persuaded her sister to take a walk outside, as she had not been outside Mrs Jennings' for nearly two weeks. As they were walking, they came upon their brother, John Dashwood. He was rather happy to see them, and mentioned that he had intended to visit them after arriving in town, but had been quite busy. Elinor soon discovered that he and Fanny had been in town for two days.</p>

	<p>"I have heard that you are here with a woman of very good fortune. And the Middletons too, you must introduce me to them, as well."</p>

	<p>"Excellent indeed. Their attention to our comfort, their friendliness is more than I hoped for."</p>

	<p>Her brother promised to go for a visit the next day, and did come; though Mrs John Dashwood did not join him. He was quite polite to Mrs Jennings, and even more so to Colonel Brandon, who was there for a visit, as well.</p>

	<p>After staying with them half an hour, he asked Elinor to walk with him to the Middletons home for an introduction. Just after they left Mrs Jennings' home, he began with several questions.</p>

	<p>"Who is Colonel Brandon? Is he a man of fortune?"</p>

	<p>"Yes, he is."</p>

	<p>"I am happy for that. He seems to be an excellent gentleman. Congratulations, Elinor, on an excellent match!"</p>

	<p>"Me, what do you mean?"</p>

	<p>"He likes you. I saw him watching you. What is the amount of his fortune?"</p>

	<p>"I believe about two thousand pounds a year."</p>

	<p>"Two thousand a year, that's excellent. I wish you good fortune, Elinor."</p>

	<p>"I am very sure that Colonel Brandon does not wish to marry me."</p>

	<p>"You should try to win him, Elinor. Fanny is very concerned for you. She wishes for you to be well-married, and her mother does, as well."</p>

	<p>Elinor refused to answer.</p>

	<p>"It would be wonderful if Fanny had a brother and I a sister who were married at the same time."</p>

	<p>"Is Mr Edward Ferrars," said Elinor, trying to be calm, "going to be married?"</p>

	<p>"His excellent mother, Mrs Ferrars, has agreed to give him a thousand pounds a year if he will marry the honorable Miss Morton, with a fortune of thirty thousand pounds. She is quite a generous woman. When we arrived, she gave Fanny a present of two hundred pounds, as she knows how difficult and expensive it is for us here in town." He paused for her pity.</p>

	<p>"Your expenses both in town and the country are large, but so is your income."</p>

	<p>"Not so large as many people believe it to be. Our father, at his death, gave many valuables to your mother, which we have had to replace since you four left Norland. Such purchases have been quite expensive."</p>

	<p>Elinor had to smile, but could say nothing.</p>

	<p>After explaining how poor he now was, he became more cheerful, and spoke again, "Mrs Jennings seems to be quite a valuable friend for you. Perhaps she will leave you and our sisters a fortune when she dies."</p>

	<p>"I believe she would not leave us anything. She has no reason to leave us anything. Of course she will leave the rest of her fortune to her children, rather than three young girls she has not long known."</p>

	<p>They soon arrived at the Middletons for a short visit. Elinor knew that her brother felt guilty in not fulfilling his promise to their father to take care of his sisters and their mother. He hoped that his sisters would soon marry wealthy husbands, so he would no longer have to feel such guilt. After their visit, Mr John Dashwood was delighted with his new friends, and promised to bring Fanny along for the next visit, as he knew she would take an interest in Lady Middleton.</p>
