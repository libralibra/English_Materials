	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER FIFTY-FOUR</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">A</span> few days later, Mr Knightley arrived at Hartfield, looking quite upset.</p>

	<p>"I have something to tell you, Emma; some news."</p>

	<p>"Good or bad?" she asked quickly.</p>

	<p>"I am afraid, dear Emma, you will not like to hear it," he paused, "Harriet Smith marries Robert Martin."</p>

	<p>Emma was shocked, "No, this is impossible!"</p>

	<p>"It is so, indeed!" continued Mr Knightley, "I heard it from Robert Martin himself."</p>

	<p>Emma could not speak.</p>

	<p>"You do not like it, but in time, perhaps your opinion will change. We will not speak of this subject."</p>

	<p>"You mistake me, you quite mistake me," she replied," I am not unhappy, but I cannot believe it. I cannot believe he proposed marriage to her again, and she accepted!" then paused. "Well!" she exclaimed. "Tell me everything."</p>

	<p>"It is a very simple story. He went to London for business three days ago, and I had him send some papers to my brother. He delivered the papers, and was asked to have dinner with the family. While at the Knightleys, he spoke to Harriet. She accepted his proposal, and he has never been happier."</p>

	<p>He stopped. Her silence disturbed him.</p>

	<p>"Emma, my love, he has made your friend, Harriet, quite happy. Perhaps you will think better of him with time."</p>

	<p>She could not speak, or he would know how delighted she felt after hearing the news.</p>

	<p>After a short silence, she spoke, "I have been silent from surprise. This has happened so suddenly. Are you quite sure she accepted his offer? Did not you misunderstand him? You were both talking of other things, of business and his trip; perhaps you did not understand his meaning."</p>

	<p>"Do you think I do not know what a man is talking of? I am quite sure that he told me she had accepted him."</p>

	<p>"I am perfectly satisfied," Emma replied, "and wish them happiness."</p>

	<p>"Your opinion has changed since we last discussed this subject."</p>

	<p>"I hope so, I was a fool then."</p>

	<p>"And I am changed also, I now believe Harriet to be a thoughtful, kind young woman, and think Mr Martin will be quite happy."</p>

	<p>Their conversation soon ended, and she was alone. She wanted to be alone. Her mind was dancing and singing; she laughed and could not be happier after hearing the news. She had to laugh, after Harriet's poor luck with other men&#151;such a heart&#151;such a Harriet! Now, Emma would be excited for her return; everything would be pleasure in her returning. It would be a great pleasure to know Robert Martin.</p>

	<p>That evening, she and her father went to the Westons for a visit. Mrs Weston had been surprised by Emma's news, but thought Mr Knightley would make a perfect husband for her dearest Emma. Frank Churchill and Jane Fairfax were to join them, as well.</p>

	<p>Emma was extremely glad to see Frank Churchill, although the two were a bit embarrassed to see each other. Soon enough, Frank Churchill turned to Emma to speak:</p>

	<p>"I have to thank you, Miss Woodhouse, for a very kind, forgiving message in one of Mrs Weston's letters. I hope you have still forgiven me."</p>

	<p>"Of course," cried Emma, "I am glad to see you and congratulate you."</p>

	<p>He thanked her, and continued to speak:</p>

	<p>"Is not she looking well?" said he, turning his head towards Jane, "Better than before."</p>

	<p>Soon, he spoke of the Campbells, and the Dixons. Emma was embarrassed when she heard that name.</p>

	<p>"I feel so ashamed."</p>

	<p>"The shame," he answered, "is all mine. You had no suspicion of a secret relationship between Jane and Mr Dixon?"</p>

	<p>"Never did I have a suspicion."</p>

	<p>"That is wonderful to hear. Now, I know it would have been better to have told you the secret."</p>

	<p>"It is not worth a regret," said Emma.</p>

	<p>"I have hoped that my uncle will visit Highbury soon. He wants to meet Jane. When the Campbells return, we shall meet them in London. Till this morning, we have not met since the secret was known to everyone."</p>

	<p>After a pause, he began, "I hope Mr Knightley is well. I was delighted to hear the news of your engagement."</p>

	<p>Emma was pleased to hear him speak about Mr Knightley, but he soon began to speak of Jane again.</p>

	<p>"How smooth her skin is! So delicate and fair. Her dark eyes and hair, so unusual, but so beautiful."</p>

	<p>Emma was delighted to see Frank Churchill that evening, and now thought of him as a good friend.</p>
