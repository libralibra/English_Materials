	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">Progress</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">D</span>uring the next four months, I did not enter Mrs Graham's house, nor did she enter mine. But still, we continued to be friends.</p>

	<p>Sometimes, I saw her when she was walking with her son. I rather liked to see Mrs Graham, and to talk to her son. At first, Mrs Graham was rather cold when I would approach her on the hill, but after some time, she began to trust me as a good friend. Arthur would run to meet me, excited to see his new friend. I enjoyed the boy, as well. He was quite friendly and entertaining. I believe Mrs Graham enjoyed our conversations.</p>

	<p>One February morning, we sat together talking, and discovered that we shared the same views on many subjects. I went home quite charmed with the woman, and started to think that perhaps I would enjoy spending time with Mrs Graham, rather than Eliza Millward. But then, I felt guilty for such thoughts.</p>

	<p>I returned home to find Eliza sitting with Rose. In the past, the surprise would have delighted me, but I was bored with Eliza's conversation, in comparison with the mature and honest Mrs Graham. I began visiting Wildfell Hall quite frequently.</p>

	<p>One evening, I went for a visit, and found Mrs Graham and Arthur sitting outside. She was drawing while he sat playing. I watched her draw, but it seemed to upset her, so I suggested that I take Arthur around the fields on my horse. She agreed. This was the first time she let me take him away from her. We returned after some time; she seemed rather annoyed that it took such a long time. She said they must return home. As we came near the house, she stopped walking and turned to me to say goodbye.</p>

	<p>As I began to walk home, I saw Mr Lawrence riding towards me on his horse. I went to speak to him, for we had not met for some time.</p>

	<p>"Was that Mrs Graham you were speaking to just now?" he asked.</p>

	<p>"Yes."</p>

	<p>"I thought so," he said, looking a bit upset.</p>

	<p>"Well! What?"</p>

	<p>"Oh, nothing," replied he. "I thought you didn't like her," he added.</p>

	<p>"I didn't, but my opinion has changed."</p>

	<p>He looked at me closer, "So your opinion has changed."</p>

	<p>"Lawrence," said I, calmly looking him in the face, "are you in love with Mrs Graham?"</p>

	<p>Instead of looking shocked, he laughed, looking quite amused.</p>

	<p>"I'm in love with her!" he said as he laughed, "What a silly question!"</p>

	<p>"You seem to be quite interested in my changing opinion on the fair lady. Perhaps you envy me."</p>

	<p>"Envy you! No, but I thought you were going to marry Eliza Millward."</p>

	<p>"You thought wrong then; I am not going to marry Eliza nor Mrs Graham," I told him, "Are you going to marry Jane Wilson?"</p>

	<p>"No, I think not."</p>

	<p>We then said goodbye.</p>
