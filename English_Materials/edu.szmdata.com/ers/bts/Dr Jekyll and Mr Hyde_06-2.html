	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER SIX</p>

	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">A Lawyer's Promise</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">J</span>ust a few days later Mr Utterson was invited to a dinner party at Henry Jekyll's house. This was quite lucky, because of his determination to help his friend. Jekyll had invited five other old friends also, and the conversation was intelligent and interesting. Jekyll always served excellent food and wine at his parties.</p>

	<p>When the other men had left, Mr Utterson stayed. He and Jekyll would stay up late into the night after these dinners. It was always wonderful to sit in front of the fire, talking softly after the exciting conversation of the evening. Tonight, Utterson watched Henry Jekyll carefully, but he could not see any change in the friend he had known for so many years.</p>

	<p>Although Jekyll had been close friends with both Utterson and Lanyon at school, he was younger than they. He had been a young genius, and had entered university at a young age. Now Jekyll was more than fifty years old, but he looked much younger. His face always looked kindly, and his eyes had a bit of hidden mystery in them. But as Mr Utterson examined him, his face looked calm and happy as he poured two glasses of wine for himself and Mr Utterson as they relaxed in large, comfortable chairs.</p>

	<p>Mr Utterson waited until his friend had finished his glass of wine and said: "Henry, my friend, I have wanted to speak with you in private. I have some questions about your will."</p>

	<p>The doctor's young face suddenly looked a bit uncomfortable, but he replied cheerfully. "My dear Utterson, no lawyer should be as unlucky as to have me for a client! You seem so worried and upset for me! I have not seen many people ever look so worried. No, that is not true, I have often seen Lanyon more worried and upset by my own scientific ideas&#151;ideas which he believes are crazy, because they go against common opinions. Now, don't worry for me, Utterson. I know Lanyon is a good man, but he's also the most stubborn man I know. I am very disappointed in Lanyon, most disappointed than I have ever been with a man before."</p>

	<p>Utterson did not want to change the subject and continued to speak. "You know, Jekyll, I never liked your will. I told you when you first gave it to me."</p>

	<p>"Yes, I know, I know," said Jekyll, with a little anger in his voice. "You have told me many times."</p>

	<p>"And now I must tell you again," said the lawyer, "because I learned something terrible about Mr Hyde."</p>

	<p>Jekyll's large, handsome face became pale and a strange light appeared in his eyes. "I don't want to talk any more about this topic," he said firmly and coldly.</p>

	<p>"I just want&#160;...&#160;" began Utterson.</p>

	<p>"No! It does not matter what you have heard. It does not make a difference." Jekyll spoke quickly and nervously. "My mind is decided, and it will not be changed by talk. So, we will not speak any more about this conversation!"</p>

	<p>"I just want to help you," Utterson replied calmly. "We have been friends for a long time, you know you can trust me. Please tell me the story in private, and I will do everything I can to help you."</p>

	<p>With a hard effort, Jekyll became calm. "Utterson, my dear friend, you are always so good to me. Of course, I trust you as the closest friend I have. I trust you more than myself. But I do not need any help; my situation is not so bad. It is not what you think. But my affair is a private one. I don't want you to worry, so I will say one thing&#151;I can make Mr Hyde disappear at any moment I wish. I promise you that. But I still thank you many times for your friendship."</p>

	<p>Utterson decided not to say any more. "I trust that you know what is best," he said as he stood up. "Well, it is getting late, and I should return home."</p>

	<p>Jekyll stood up with his friend and walked him to the door. "I wish to say just one more thing about this subject before we forget it forever," said Jekyll. "Hyde is a strange man, but I have a great interest in him. He told me that you had met him, and I fear he was rude to you. Still, old friend, I want you to promise me something."</p>

	<p>"What?"</p>

	<p>"If, for some reason, I disappear, will you defend poor Hyde? Though he has a strange personality, please see that he receives everything I want him to have. I believe that you would do this for me, if you knew everything about Hyde."</p>

	<p>"I can't say that I will ever like that man," said the lawyer.</p>

	<p>"I am not asking you to like him," said Jekyll, putting his hand on Utterson's shoulder. "I only want him to be treated fairly. Help Hyde, for me&#160;... when I am no longer here."</p>

	<p>Utterson nodded his head to agree, but his face was very sad. "Yes, my friend," he said. "I promise."</p>
