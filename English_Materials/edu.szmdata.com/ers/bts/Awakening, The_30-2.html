	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER THIRTY</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">E</span>dna tried to work on her painting in the early morning, but finding it too difficult to think, she decided to go visit Ms Reisz. On her way there, she met Madame Ratignolle. Her friend complained that it seemed Edna had forgotten her. She wanted to hear about the dinner the other night and to see Edna's new home.</p>

	<p>"It's not a very good idea, you living alone in that place. I'd suggest that you have someone move in with you until your husband returns. People are saying that Alcee Arobin often comes to your home. I wouldn't trust him at all, if I were you. He's got a terrible reputation with women. And he could really make you look terrible to the rest of society."</p>

	<p>Edna made no comment about this and, instead, told her friend that she had an appointment to meet someone in the city. She promised to visit Ad&#232;le soon.</p>

	<p>When she knocked on Ms Reisz's door no one answered. Edna then let herself in to wait for the pianist to return home. Ms Reisz had given her the key so that she could come and go as she pleased. Edna often went there in the afternoon to relax and talk about Robert. To pass the time, she sat at the piano and tried to play a simple song with one hand.</p>

	<p>Then there was a knock at the front door. She cried out, "Come in!" At first nothing happened, but then a moment later a figure came through the doorway. It was Robert. She stayed seated to avoid making her excitement too obvious.</p>

	<p>"You look great, Mrs Pontellier!" he said, walking up to her and putting her hand in his. "I didn't expect to meet you here."</p>

	<p>"Did you just return today?" Edna asked with a shaking voice.</p>

	<p>"A couple of days ago, actually."</p>

	<p>"Ah. And&#160;... well, when did you plan to see me?" she asked, breaking off the stem of a flower on top of the piano.</p>

	<p>"I was planning to visit you, but&#160;... well, I started work again at the business almost right away. I came back because I felt that Mexico was no better than America for my career."</p>

	<p>It hurt Edna to hear that his reason for returning had nothing to do with her. She got up to go.</p>

	<p>"You're leaving without seeing Ms Reisz?" asked Robert.</p>

	<p>"She won't return until late," Edna answered, putting on her hat and walking toward the door.</p>

	<p>"Well, at least let me accompany you home," Robert said, following her out of the apartment.</p>

	<p>When they arrived at her home, Edna invited Robert to come in for dinner. He resisted at first, making excuses that his mother was expecting him, but then he suddenly completely changed his mind and accepted the invitation.</p>

	<p>As they waited for Celestine to serve dinner, they chatted about Mexico.</p>

	<p>"What was it like?" asked Edna.</p>

	<p>"All that I did was think about the summer at Grand Isle," he answered. "And you, what did you think about all this time?"</p>

	<p>"The same thing. The very same thing."</p>

	<p>"What's this?" asked Robert picking up a photograph of Alcee Arobin that was lying on the table.</p>

	<p>"Oh, I've collected many photographs this year. It's for my painting."</p>

	<p>"Yes, but why Alcee Arobin?"</p>

	<p>"He and I are friends."</p>

	<p>"I would hardly consider his face worth painting," commented Robert, seeming a little bothered.</p>

	<p>After dinner, as Robert began to roll a cigarette for himself, Edna noticed that he carried his tobacco in a new handmade bag.</p>

	<p>"Where did you get that?" she asked.</p>

	<p>"A Mexican woman made it for me," he answered.</p>

	<p>Edna became very jealous and began to ask him all kinds of questions about the woman. Robert acted as though the woman meant nothing at all to him. He told her that the Mexicans liked to give presents to foreigners.</p>

	<p>Then a knock came at the door. It was Alcee Arobin. He had come by to tell Edna that that week's card party was cancelled at Mrs Merriman's.</p>

	<p>"Hi there, Arobin!" Robert greeted him.</p>

	<p>"Why, Robert Lebrun! You're back from Mexico already? I guess that you didn't have much success with the beautiful Mexican women then. Too bad."</p>

	<p>"Oh, I don't know about that," said Edna, "A beautiful Mexican woman made him a tobacco bag."</p>

	<p>"Really? You must have done quite well then, if you had women making things for you!"</p>

	<p>"I'd better be going now. Nice to see you both," said Robert, getting up and walking out the door.</p>

	<p>"So, what shall we do today?" asked Arobin.</p>

	<p>"Nothing. I don't want to do anything but relax. You go ahead and go."</p>

	<p>"Alright. But I'll be terribly unhappy without you."</p>

	<p>"Yes, I'm sure you say that to all of the women, Alcee," she said, feeling terribly bothered that Robert had left so quickly.</p>
