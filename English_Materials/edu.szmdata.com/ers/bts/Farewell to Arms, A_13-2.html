	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER THIRTEEN</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">T</span>he doctor came in that afternoon. He took many bomb pieces from my legs, and, with the knife, searched for other pieces. Luckily, he was using a special medicine that took away the feeling in my legs, so there was no pain. However, he decided that an X-ray would be necessary, so he sewed me up and ordered the nurse to have me taken downstairs the following morning.</p>

	<p>The next day they took me to another hospital and had my legs put under the X-ray machine. The doctor there was very friendly. He saw the inside of my legs and told me it was pretty bad. He hoped that I had shot a lot of Austrians. I lied and told him I had.</p>

	<p>Later, that afternoon, I got to see the X-ray pictures of my legs, myself. Catherine brought them to me. The doctor was right. There was a lot of metal in there. However, I was less interested in the pictures than I was in having sex with Catherine again. Unfortunately, she only had time to show me the pictures and then left.</p>

	<p>The day was very hot, and I felt bored and frustrated lying in bed. Three doctors came into the room. One of them was the doctor who had treated me the day before. I guessed that he was not a very good doctor. After all, he needed an X-ray done to finish the job. That meant that the other two doctors were probably equally as bad, for bad doctors like to keep each other company.</p>

	<p>They had my bandages removed. Looking down, I could see that my legs looked less like chopped meat and more like legs today.</p>

	<p>"Try to move your knee. Can you bend it?" asked the doctor with the beard.</p>

	<p>"No."</p>

	<p>"Can you try, we need to test it!" They took hold of my leg and bent it for me. A pain shot through my body and I cried out for them not to move it any further.</p>

	<p>They then took a look at my X-ray photos. The bearded doctor said that he would recommend waiting half a year to operate. The other doctors agreed with him right away. I did not, however.</p>

	<p>"That's too long! I can't imagine why I should have to wait six months."</p>

	<p>"If you don't wait, you may lose your knee."</p>

	<p>"So what? I don't care about my knee."</p>

	<p>The man who treated me the day before assured the other doctors that I was not serious. He told them that I was an excellent soldier who was possibly to receive a medal. The bearded doctor then came over to me.</p>

	<p>"Calm down, I understand it's a long time to wait, but it would be unsafe to operate sooner than six months. I'm not willing to risk losing your knee."</p>

	<p>"OK, then, I'll accept your advice. Thank you very much."</p>

	<p>They went away, and I called the doctor who had treated me before back into the room.</p>

	<p>"That doctor with the beard is too low in rank. I won't let him operate on me. I want someone else to come and look at my legs," I said.</p>

	<p>"Dr Barella is a good doctor!"</p>

	<p>"Then why is he still ranked so low? No, I want somebody better to come and give his opinion about my legs."</p>

	<p>"High rank doesn't necessarily mean excellence. However, if you insist, I will ask the surgeon from the hospital where you had your X-ray to come."</p>

	<p>"Thanks. I can't wait six months."</p>

	<p>"It wouldn't be as bad as you think. You wouldn't just lie in bed the whole time. You'd exercise some. And you would be taken outside so that your legs could get some sun."</p>

	<p>"I just can't wait six months."</p>

	<p>"Fine. I'll have Dr Valentini visit you later today."</p>

	<p>When Dr Valentini did come, he looked me over very carefully. As he did so, he talked to me the whole time in a friendly, funny way. I could see from his decorations that he was ranked very high. He was a major, in fact. He saw Catherine come in to say 'Hello' to me, and after she left, told me how proud he was that I had such a beautiful girlfriend. I offered him a drink of my wine and he gladly accepted it. I liked him. And I liked him even more when he told me that my leg could be operated on the following morning.</p>
