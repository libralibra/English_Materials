	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER TWENTY-NINE</p>

	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">First Promotion</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">J</span>ulien had not recovered from the shock of seeing Mrs de R&#x00EA;nal when Father Pirard called for him. "Father Chas Bernard has sent a letter about you. I am happy with your behavior. You have a kind heart and an excellent mind, and I don't want it to be wasted.</p>

	<p>"I have been here fifteen years, but I will soon be gone. Before I leave, I want to do something for you. I am making you the Bible teacher." Julien was so happy he kissed Father Pirard's hand. "Well, I like you, boy," the priest said. "Your work will be hard. Something about you makes people envious."</p>

	<p>Julien had not heard a friendly voice for a long time, and when he heard this he cried.</p>

	<p>The promotion was good for Julien. He hated to eat with the other students, and now he could eat alone. He also could walk in the garden alone. His pride had made him many enemies, but now it seemed proper. Soon nobody called him Martin Luther.</p>

	<p>It was hunting season, and Fouqu&#xE9; sent a deer and a pig to the school. Fouqu&#xE9; said it was from Julien's family. The other students now thought Julien's family was rich, so they paid him even more respect.</p>

	<p>Soon it was time for examinations. On the first day, Vicar-General de Frilair's men were angry that they were giving first place to Father Pirard's favorite student, Julien. On the next day, one examiner asked Julien about the books of Horace and other ancient writers. Julien had memorized many lines from Horace. Julien forgot where he was and talked about Horace for twenty minutes until the examiner became angry. The examiner yelled at him for spending so much time reading that kind of book.</p>

	<p>"You are right," Julien answered. "I am a fool."</p>

	<p>Everyone knew it was a dirty trick, but Father de Frilair wanted to hurt his enemy Father Pirard. Father de Frilair put Julien in 198th place.</p>

	<p>A few weeks later Julien received a letter from Paris. The letter was signed "Paul Sorel." Paul said he was a relative, and gave Julien a lot of money. The letter told him to continue to study good Latin writers like Horace.</p>

	<p>Mrs de R&#x00EA;nal sent it! Julien thought. She doesn't want me to be sad. Julien was very wrong, however.</p>

	<p>While working for the bishop, Father de Frilair had made himself very wealthy. In time he came to own half of a piece of land. The other half was owned by Marquis de la Mole. The marquis was angry that this priest would challenge him, so they had a great lawsuit. The marquis wrote Father Ch&#x00E9;lan for help, and Father Ch&#x00E9;lan told him to write to Father Pirard. Although they never met each other, the powerful marquis and Father Pirard became friends. Father Pirard worked hard on the lawsuit, but he would never accept any money. Marquis de la Mole decided to send some money to Father Pirard's favorite student instead.</p>

	<p>One day Father Pirard received another letter. Marquis de la Mole knew Father Pirard would soon be fired, and the marquis offered Father Pirard a position as priest in a wealthy part of Paris. It was a wonderful job offer.</p>

	<p>Father Pirard wrote a very long, respectful letter to the bishop. He told the bishop everything that was done to him at the school. He got Julien out of bed and gave him the letter. "Take this to the bishop," he said, "but be careful with your words. I am quitting this job."</p>

	<p>Julien dressed and went to the bishop's palace. A priest took the letter and read it. Julien realized this priest was Father de Frilair. The priest was dressed very nicely, but he had a dishonest face. The bishop entered the room and Julien bowed. "The terrible Father Pirard is finally leaving us," Father de Frilair said.</p>

	<p>"I don't think you can find a better man," the bishop replied. "Send in that student. I want to talk to him."</p>

	<p>Before asking about Father Pirard, the bishop asked Julien questions about his studies. The bishop was very surprised by Julien's knowledge, and he asked Julien about Virgil, Horace, and Cicero, three ancient writers. Julien's knowledge impressed the bishop again. The bishop said, "I didn't expect to find such a smart man as a student!"</p>

	<p>"There are smarter students than me," Julien replied. "I was 198th in the examinations."</p>

	<p>"I see! You are Father Pirard's boy, then," the bishop laughed. "I can see you'll go far."</p>

	<p>They talked for a long time more, and the bishop noticed Julien had never heard of Tacitus, another writer. "You've given me a wonderful evening," the bishop said, "and I want to give you a gift. It may not be religious, but please take this set of books by Tacitus."</p>

	<p>Julien returned to the school. Every student knew about his conversation with the bishop. They all wanted to talk to him, even Father Castan&#xE8;de, who hated Julien. Father Pirard left the school, and people learned of his position in Paris. They thought he had played the game of politics very well, but Father Pirard still loved the school.</p>
