	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER FORTY-SEVEN</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">T</span>hat evening, when the family was sitting together, Marianne began speaking about Willoughby.</p>

	<p>"It was a great relief to me&#151;what Elinor told me this morning&#151;I have now heard exactly what I wished to hear. I wish for no change. I never could have been happy with him, after knowing all this. I now have no regrets, nothing but my own foolishness."</p>

	<p>"Rather your mother's foolishness, my child," said Mrs Dashwood.</p>

	<p>During this time, Elinor was becoming more impatient to hear of Edward's plans. She had heard nothing of him since she had left London.</p>

	<p>One morning, one of their servants returned from doing business at Mrs Ferrars' country home.</p>

	<p>"I suppose you know, ma'am, that Mr Ferrars is married," he informed Elinor.</p>

	<p>Marianne began screaming and was taken to her room. In the meantime, Elinor turned pale, but continued to remain calm.</p>

	<p>"Who told you that Mr Ferrars was married?" she asked.</p>

	<p>"I saw Mr Ferrars myself this morning. He was with Miss Steele, as they have recently married."</p>

	<p>The rest of the day, Elinor tried to look calm so her family would not worry, but she was quite upset after hearing the news of Lucy Steele marrying Edward.</p>
