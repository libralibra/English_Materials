	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER TWO</p>

	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">The First Spirit</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">W</span>hen Scrooge woke up it was so dark in the room that he could barely see. He was shocked to see that it was still nighttime. "How long have I slept?" he thought. "Perhaps not long. I hope morning will arrive soon!" Suddenly he heard the sound of the large clock on the church tower. The clock would tell him what time it was. "Probably it's almost dawn," said Scrooge.</p>

	<p>However, to his amazement, the bells in the clock rang five, six, seven, eight&#160;... twelve times! How could it be twelve o'clock at night? Scrooge thought that it must have been two o'clock in the morning when he went to bed. "The clock must be broken! It can't be possible that I have slept through one whole day, and into the next night!"</p>

	<p>This idea was so upsetting to Scrooge that he jumped out of bed and ran to the window. It was very foggy outside, and extremely cold. There were no sounds of people running in the streets. Scrooge was relieved. "Everyone is still sleeping. That stupid clock is probably just broken!" he said, and got into his bed again. The room was terribly cold, because the little fire had died many hours ago.</p>

	<p>Scrooge laid in his bed and thought. He was trying to understand what had happened. Had Jacob Marley's ghost really come to see him? Was it all a bad dream? Scrooge tried to tell himself that ghosts were not real, and only stupid children believed in them. But he could not persuade himself that a ghost had not been there. Those terrible chains, and the way the ghost had cried out! Scrooge remembered every moment.</p>

	<p>Suddenly he sat up in bed, because he remembered that Marley's ghost had told him that the first spirit would arrive at one o'clock. He decided to stay awake until the clock had struck one, just to see what would happen. "I am sure that no spirit will enter my bedroom, and I can go to sleep and forget all about this!" said Scrooge. But he was not so sure.</p>

	<p>The hour between twelve and one o'clock passed slowly. Scrooge almost fell asleep once or twice. But suddenly the clock struck one.</p>

	<p>"There! Nothing happened!" said Scrooge loudly.</p>

	<p>Suddenly there was a bright light in the room.</p>

	<p>As Scrooge watched, a small, white hand pulled back the curtains around his bed.</p>

	<p>Amazed and frightened, Scrooge sat up in bed to see the owner of the hand. A small, strange person, or creature, stood before him.</p>

	<p>The spirit was as small and thin as a child, but there was something about it that reminded Scrooge of an old, wise, ancient man. Its hair was pure white like an old man's, and very long. However, this was not the spirit of an old man; the spirit's skin was as young, smooth, and soft as a child's. Its arms and hands were white and very strong looking, as if it could grab you and hold on tightly. The spirit's legs and feet were just like a child's, and they were bare, just like the arms and hands. It wore a small white dress and a beautiful belt. In its hand there was a piece of a holly plant, with beautiful red berries and fresh green leaves. This plant is a symbol of Christmas. However, the strangest thing about the little spirit's appearance was its head. A bright, clear light shone from the top of the spirit's head, and it was this light that allowed Scrooge to see the spirit in the dark room. In its other hand the spirit carried a little cap. Scrooge wondered if the cap put out the light when the spirit wore it.</p>

	<p>But as Scrooge stared at the strange visitor, he had to admit that the light coming from the top of the spirit's head was not its strangest quality. The belt around the spirit's dress sparkled brightly, and it seemed to Scrooge that parts of the spirit's body disappeared and then appeared again in the darkness. He was never looking at the spirit's entire body at once; only at its arms, or legs, or head. But just when Scrooge thought that the spirit had disappeared entirely, it would come back again, and be as clear as ever.</p>

	<p>"Are you the First Spirit, which Marley's ghost said would visit me?" asked Scrooge.</p>

	<p>"I am!"</p>

	<p>The Spirit's voice was soft, gentle, and clear, like a child's. Scrooge noticed that the voice seemed to come from far away, even though the Spirit was standing next to his bed.</p>

	<p>"Who are you, then? What do you want?" demanded Scrooge.</p>

	<p>"I am the Ghost of Christmas Past," said the visitor.</p>

	<p>"Are you the Ghost of the long ago past?" asked Scrooge.</p>

	<p>"No, I am the Ghost of your past," said the Ghost.</p>

	<p>Scrooge did not understand this. Suddenly, for some reason that he did not understand, he wanted to see the Ghost with its little cap on. But when he asked the Ghost to do this, the ghost only looked at him and said,</p>

	<p>"What! Why are you so quick to put out the light I give? You are always in the darkness," it said, looking around the room.</p>

	<p>Then Scrooge asked why the Ghost had come.</p>

	<p>"I have come to help you," said the Ghost.</p>

	<p>Scrooge thought to himself that he wished the Ghost had come in the daytime, so that he could sleep. But the Ghost knew what he was thinking.</p>

	<p>"I have come to save you, then. Remember this!"</p>

	<p>Then the Ghost put out its small, strong hand and took Scrooge's arm. "Stand up, and walk with me," it said.</p>

	<p>Scrooge knew it was useless to protest, and say that it was too late at night, and too cold, or that he was in his sleeping clothes, or was an old man, or that he was ill, or many other things. Although the spirit's touch was gentle, Scrooge knew he had to do what the Ghost said. So he got out of bed. The Ghost took him over to the bedroom window. "Good spirit, I am a human man. I cannot float through the air, as you can. I will certainly fall!" said Scrooge.</p>

	<p>"You will not fall. Hold my hand, and it will keep you safe!" said the Ghost.</p>

	<p>So Scrooge and the Ghost passed through the window of his house. Scrooge was astonished to see that they were not floating through the air. They were not even in London anymore! The darkness and fog had vanished. Instead, Scrooge was standing on a country road. It was a clear, cold winter day, and the sun was shining. The thick snow sparkled on the ground. He gave a great cry of surprise: "Why, I know this place! I grew up here. I was a child here!"</p>

	<p>As Scrooge looked around him at the beautiful winter day, he clasped his hands together. Color came into his pale old face. The Ghost was no longer holding his hand, but somehow Scrooge could still feel the spirit's touch&#151;it burned a little, like cold ice.</p>

	<p>All around him Scrooge seemed to hear the sounds of his past, and there were many smells in the fresh, cold air. Each smell and sound reminded Scrooge of memories&#151;things he had not thought of in years!</p>

	<p>The Ghost of Christmas Past was observing Scrooge. "Your lip is trembling," it said. "And what is that upon your cheek?"</p>

	<p>"It's nothing," said Scrooge. "Please, Ghost, where are we going? Take me wherever you want!"</p>

	<p>"Do you remember the way?" asked the Ghost.</p>

	<p>"Remember the way? Oh, yes! I could walk these paths if I was blind!" cried Scrooge.</p>

	<p>"Then it is strange that you have forgotten them for so many years!" said the Ghost. "Let us go!"</p>

	<p>Scrooge and the Ghost walked along the road. Scrooge knew every tree and little house along the way. Soon they saw a small village that sat next to a river. Five or six little horses appeared on the road, and some young boys were riding them. The boys laughed and talked to each other so cheerfully that the crisp, fresh air seemed to sing.</p>

	<p>"Can they see us? Should I speak to them?" Scrooge asked the Ghost.</p>

	<p>"No. Those children, and everything around you, are only shadows of things that once were, shadows of your past," said the Ghost.</p>

	<p>The boys riding the horses came nearer, and Scrooge remembered the names of every one of the children. As they parted from each other they called out to each other "Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas!" Scrooge heard two of them talking about the wonderful things they would do that day.</p>

	<p>Now, dear reader, if you had been watching Scrooge at this moment, you might think it was strange to see Scrooge's cold eyes shine, and his soft smile, when he heard the boys say "Merry Christmas!" After all, you and I both know that Scrooge did not care about Christmas. He hated Christmas! What was the good of Christmas, as he always liked to say?</p>

	<p>"Although it is afternoon, the school is not yet empty," said the Ghost. "One child still sits inside alone, with no friends."</p>

	<p>"I know it, I know it!" cried Scrooge, and sobbed.</p>

	<p>Soon Scrooge and the Ghost reached the schoolhouse. It was a large, brick building, very old and dirty. There were chickens running around in the front yard. They entered the building and passed through many cold, empty rooms. All the children had left the school and gone home to be with their families&#151;all except one. In one of the rooms a young boy sat in front of a small fire, reading a book. Scrooge cried out, and some tears rolled down his face. The boy was Ebenezer Scrooge himself, when he was young!</p>

	<p>The schoolroom was so quiet that Scrooge could hear the noises of the mice in the walls. The Ghost touched Scrooge on the arm, and pointed to the young boy, who had not even looked up from his book. He was reading <i>A Thousand and One Nights</i>. Suddenly Scrooge saw a man in colorful, foreign clothing appear outside the window. He had dark skin and hair, and had a long sword on his belt. He was leading a donkey by a rope.</p>

	<p>Suddenly the schoolroom was filled with the characters from the book! Scrooge wondered if this was the Ghost's magic. "Why, it's dear old Ali Baba!" cried Scrooge, pointing to the man with the donkey. "I loved this book when I was younger! Look, don't you see him? And over there, are Orson and Valentine! And there's that man who fell asleep at the Gate of Damascus&#151;what was his name? I remember the story! And there's the Sultan's servant, who was turned upside down by the Genie! That was his punishment for trying to marry the beautiful Princess!"</p>

	<p>If the many business men and lawyers of London had seen the terrible old Scrooge, laughing and crying at the same time, talking about characters from a book he had read when he was young, they would have thought it was very, very strange! The Scrooge they knew would never talk about such things. And he would never look so happy and excited!</p>

	<p>"Oh, look, good Ghost! There's the parrot from <i>Robinson Crusoe</i>!" cried Scrooge, as a colorful parrot flew around the room. "He has a green body and a yellow tail, and feathers on top of his head! The parrot would shout, 'Poor Robin Crusoe, where have you been, Robin Crusoe?' and Robinson Crusoe thought it was another man! Oh, and there goes Friday, Crusoe's friend, running for his life into the forest! Hello! Hello!"</p>

	<p>Then, in the next moment Scrooge's face grew sad, and he stared at the young Scrooge, who was still reading his book. "Poor boy!" he said, looking sadly at his younger self. "I wish&#160;... but no, it's too late now," he said quietly, putting his hands in his pockets.</p>

	<p>"What do you mean? What is the matter?" asked the Ghost of Christmas Past.</p>

	<p>"It's nothing," said Scrooge. "It's not important. There were some little boys who came to sing a Christmas song at my office door last night. I wish I had given them something, that's all!"</p>

	<p>The Ghost looked at him and smiled wisely, but said nothing. "Let us see another Christmas in your past!" and waved its hand in the air.</p>

	<p>Before Scrooge could respond, he saw his younger self grow larger, and the room he was sitting in became darker, colder, and dirtier. The walls cracked, the windows became dark, and the paint fell off the walls. Scrooge did not understand how everything was happening so quickly, but he knew that time was passing. As he watched his younger self grow older, he realized that he had always stayed alone at school, when all the other boys left for Christmas.</p>

	<p>Scrooge and the Ghost watched young Ebenezer, who now looked about fifteen years old. He was not reading now. Instead he was walking up and down the room, thinking about something. Scrooge looked at the Ghost and shook his head sadly. Then he watched the door of the room.</p>

	<p>In a moment, the door opened and a little girl ran in. She ran over to the younger Scrooge and threw her arms around his neck. She kissed him and called him her "dear, dear older brother!"</p>

	<p>"I've come to take you home, dear Ebenezer!" said the little girl, jumping up and down and laughing. "Yes, we're going home, home, home!"</p>

	<p>"Home, little Fan? What do you mean?" asked Scrooge's younger self.</p>

	<p>"Yes, home!" said his sister. "You're going home, for ever and ever. You don't have to stay at this terrible, dark school anymore! Father is much nicer and kinder now, and one night when I was going to sleep, I asked him if you could come home, and he said yes! So he sent me in a carriage to find you. You'll grow up and be a man, and live and work at home! And the best thing is, we'll be together for all of Christmas, and have the happiest time in the world!"</p>

	<p>"You are quite a little woman, Fan!" said young Ebenezer, laughing at his sister.</p>

	<p>The little girl clapped her hands and laughed. She stood on the tops of her toes to hug her brother. She was so excited that she began to pull him out the door. Young Ebenezer seemed happy to go.</p>

	<p>Suddenly the room was filled with a loud, angry voice. "Bring down Master Scrooge's suitcase!" Then the schoolmaster appeared. He was a loud and angry man, and all the boys at school were afraid of him. The schoolmaster looked at young Ebenezer and his sister as if they were little worms. But to their surprise, the schoolmaster took them into his sitting room, where he gave them some wine and cake. It was extremely cold and dark in the sitting room, and the young people were very cold. But they could not say "no" to the schoolmaster!</p>

	<p>After they had eaten the cake and drank the wine, the schoolmaster put young Ebenezer's suitcase into the carriage. Ebenezer and his sister thanked the schoolmaster and told him goodbye, and they were very happy to leave. The carriage went quickly down the path, which was lined on both sides with beautiful dark green trees. Snow sparkled everywhere. Scrooge could hear young Ebenezer and his sister laughing and singing in the carriage.</p>

	<p>"She was always a little thing, very delicate. She looked as though a wind would knock her down," said the Ghost. "But she had a large, loving heart!"</p>

	<p>"Oh, yes, she did!" cried old Scrooge sadly. "I can't deny it, Spirit!"</p>

	<p>"She died young," said the Ghost. "But she did have children, I believe."</p>

	<p>"Yes, she had one child, a son," said Scrooge.</p>

	<p>"That's right," said the Ghost. "Her child was your nephew!"</p>

	<p>Scrooge looked very uncomfortable. "Yes," he answered quickly.</p>

	<p>Although Scrooge and the Ghost had left the school building, Scrooge realized that they were no longer in the country. Now, they were in the busy streets of a large city. Many people filled the streets, and carriages waited for passengers. No one saw Scrooge and the Ghost, of course; they were invisible. Scrooge realized that it was again Christmas time, because all the shops were decorated for Christmas.</p>

	<p>The Ghost stopped at a certain building, and asked Scrooge if he had recognized it.</p>

	<p>"Of course I know this place!" said Scrooge. "I had my first job here, as a clerk!"</p>

	<p>They entered the building. Scrooge saw an old man sitting behind a large, high desk. The desk was so tall that if the man had been a few inches taller, he would have hit his head on the ceiling! Scrooge cried out in excitement.</p>

	<p>"Oh, Ghost, it's old Fezziwig! Fezziwig is alive again! I used to work for him!"</p>

	<p>Old Fezziwig was writing something at the high desk. Suddenly he put down his pen and looked at the clock. Scrooge saw that it was seven o'clock in the evening. Fezziwig rubbed his large hands together, stood up, and laughed a loud, cheerful laugh. The old man was large and fat, and as he laughed his stomach shook. In a loud, cheerful voice, the old man said, "Hello there, Ebenezer and Dick! Come in here!"</p>

	<p>Scrooge's younger self came into the room. Ebenezer was now a young man, and with him was another young man named Dick.</p>

	<p>"Yes, it's Dick Wilkins!" said old Scrooge to the Ghost. "There he is! Dick liked me very much. Poor Dick!"</p>

	<p>"Hello there, my boys!" said old Fezziwig. "No more work this evening! It's Christmas Eve, you know. Christmas, Ebenezer! Isn't that wonderful? Now, let's clean up the office. Quickly, now!" he said, clapping his hands together.</p>

	<p>You would not believe how quickly the two young men cleaned the office! They ran around cleaning, and closed up all the windows in just ten minutes.</p>

	<p>"Now, then!" said old Fezziwig. He jumped down from the high desk as quickly as a cat. "Let's move the furniture around, to make room for the great party!"</p>

	<p>Ebenezer and Dick did this in just a few moments. They put wood on the fire, and lit all the lamps, until the room was clean, warm, bright, and dry. Suddenly the door opened and some musicians came in with their instruments. Then Mrs Fezziwig, Fezziwig's wife, came in. She was as large and fat as her husband. She was smiling happily. Then her three daughters came in also. They were also smiling and happy. Everyone looked ready to dance! Then all the people who worked for Mr Fezziwig came in. The housemaid came, with her cousin the baker. Then the cook came with the milkman. Some young boys from the street came in, even though they didn't work for Fezziwig. Many people came into the warm, dry room. Everyone was laughing and talking together. Soon they began to dance around the room in groups of two. The music filled the room. Suddenly old Fezziwig clapped his hands and the music stopped for a moment. "Excellent music and dancing!" he cried. The musicians began to play again, as if they would never grow tired.</p>

	<p>The party continued for many hours. There was more dancing, and then there was wine, and more dancing, and cold meats, and pies, and cakes, and beer, and much more dancing! It was the happiest party old Scrooge could remember.</p>

	<p>Soon Mr and Mrs Fezziwig stood up to dance. They were both very good dancers, even though they were large and fat! Everyone laughed and clapped. The men went to drink more beer, and the women talked together and watched the children, who were running around the room.</p>

	<p>When it was eleven o'clock, the party ended. Mr and Mrs Fezziwig stood on each side of the door, shook hands with the guests, and wished them a Merry Christmas. Mrs Fezziwig kissed all the children goodbye. Soon everyone had left but Dick Wilkins and young Ebenezer Scrooge. The two clerks went to their beds, which were in a small room in a corner of the building.</p>

	<p>All this time, old Scrooge had been watching the party and not thinking about anything else, but how wonderful it was. He laughed when the other guests laughed, and danced with his feet, and sang the songs. He wished he could eat some of the meats, pies, and drink wine or beer with the happy people. His heart and soul were in that room, and he remembered everything as if it were yesterday, and not many years ago. His eyes were always looking for his young self, and while he watched the party, Scrooge felt as if he was young again. It was only when the party ended that Scrooge remembered the Ghost of Christmas Past. The little spirit was standing next to him and looking at him. The light that came from the top of its head was very bright.</p>

	<p>"It is a small thing, isn't it," said the Ghost, "to make these silly people so happy?"</p>

	<p>"A small thing? No, it isn't!" said Scrooge.</p>

	<p>The Ghost told him to listen to the two young clerks talking. They were talking about how wonderful and good old Fezziwig and his wife were. Scrooge was amazed to see his younger self. How happy he had been on that night, many years ago!</p>

	<p>"You see, Fezziwig did only a small thing," said the Ghost. "It didn't cost much money to have this party. Not very important! Why do you think it is so wonderful?"</p>

	<p>"No, good Ghost, you're wrong!" cried Scrooge. He was speaking like his younger self, not his older self&#151;but he did not realize it. "This party was a great and wonderful thing. Fezziwig is our employer. He has the power to make us happy or unhappy, to make our work difficult or easy, a pleasure or a pain. His power can be seen in his words and looks. They might not seem very important, but they are! He was very kind tonight, and none of those people will ever forget it. So you see, the happiness he gave us was as great as if it cost a mountain of gold!"</p>

	<p>Suddenly Scrooge stopped speaking. He looked as though he was thinking of something. The Ghost was looking at him with large, clear eyes.</p>

	<p>"What is the matter?" asked the Ghost.</p>

	<p>"Nothing," said Scrooge.</p>

	<p>"You are thinking of something. What is it?" said the Ghost.</p>

	<p>"No, nothing is wrong! I would like to say something to my clerk, Bob Crachit, right now. That is all," said Scrooge.</p>

	<p>Scrooge and the Ghost watched as the young Ebenezer turned off all the lamps and got into bed. Suddenly, Scrooge realized that they were standing outside the building, in the cold night air.</p>

	<p>The Ghost said to Scrooge: "My time is growing short. We must be quick!"</p>

	<p>The scene changed immediately. Once again Scrooge saw himself as a younger man. He was in his twenties now. This man's face did not yet have the cold, angry look of the old Scrooge. However, it was clear that Ebenezer was beginning to change from a young, happy man to a greedy, hard man, like the Scrooge that you and I know, dear reader.</p>

	<p>There was a sharp, eager look in Ebenezer's eyes. He thought about money much of the time. He was not alone&#151;a young, beautiful woman stood next to him. Old Scrooge saw that there were tears in her eyes as she stared at Ebenezer. Scrooge's heart jumped when he realized who the young woman was. She was his former fiancée, Belle.</p>

	<p>"It is not important to you, is it, Ebenezer?" Belle said softly. "Another love has taken my place in your heart. I suppose that if this new love can make you happy and comfort you in the future, as I wanted to do, then I cannot say anything against it."</p>

	<p>"What do you mean? What new love has taken your place?" said Ebenezer.</p>

	<p>"The love of money," said Belle.</p>

	<p>"This is how the world is!" said Ebenezer angrily. "There is nothing as hard as being poor, but the second a man wants to find wealth, people criticize him and call him greedy!"</p>

	<p>"You fear the world too much," Belle said gently. "All your hopes and dreams have died, except for the dream of money and success. What are you afraid of, Ebenezer? You do not talk to me, the way you used to."</p>

	<p>"I don't know what you're talking about!" said Ebenezer. "Even if I do think about money a little more, who cares? Money is important! Besides, I have not changed towards you."</p>

	<p>Belle shook her head sadly.</p>

	<p>"Ebenezer, when we met, we were young. We became engaged to be married when we were poor, and happy to be poor. We planned to improve our life slowly, through hard work. But we wanted to live in happiness also. Now, you are changed. You are not the man you once were."</p>

	<p>"Oh, Belle, I was a stupid boy then!" Ebenezer said loudly.</p>

	<p>"You know that your feelings for me have changed. You are different now," she said slowly. "But I have not changed. When you and I were one in our hearts, I believed that our life together would be good. But now we are two people. I do not know you anymore. So you do not have to marry me."</p>

	<p>"Have I ever told you I didn't want to marry you?" asked Ebenezer.</p>

	<p>"No, never," said the young woman.</p>

	<p>"Then why are you saying all this, Belle? What is the matter with you?" said Ebenezer.</p>

	<p>"Ebenezer, you must face the truth!" Belle said, staring at him. "Your nature has changed, and your life is different. All you do is work, and think about money. All the thoughts, ideas, and feelings that you used to have are gone now. Tell me, Ebenezer," she said, "if we had not been engaged from a young age, and you met me now, would you want to marry me? I do not think so!"</p>

	<p>Young Ebenezer did not say anything for a moment. He seemed to admit to himself that she was right. But he only said, "You don't think so."</p>

	<p>"I wish I could believe that you still loved me," Belle said. "But I have seen the truth, and I cannot deny it. You don't love me now, Ebenezer&#151;you know you don't. If you were free, you would never choose a poor girl like me to be your wife. I have heard you talk, and your own gain is the most important thing in your life. Or, even if you did marry me, you would regret it terribly! So, Ebenezer, we are no longer engaged. I do this because I love you&#151;I love the man you once were."</p>

	<p>Ebenezer was about to speak, but she turned her head away from him and continued speaking.</p>

	<p>"When I think of the past, I almost hope that you will feel pain at our separation. But I believe that you will only think of me a little. Then you will dismiss this part of your life as a dream. You will be happy that you woke up! Well, Ebenezer, I hope you will be happy in the life that you have chosen."</p>

	<p>Then Belle turned and walked out of the room. Young Ebenezer was alone.</p>

	<p>Old Scrooge felt as if a knife was cutting his heart. "Please, oh Ghost!" he cried. "Do not show me any more of the past! Take me home. Why do you enjoy making me miserable?"</p>

	<p>"One thing more, before I leave you!" said the Ghost.</p>

	<p>The scene changed again. Scrooge and the Ghost were in another place and time. They were in a small but comfortable and warm room, and it was winter. A beautiful young girl sat next to the fire. At first Scrooge thought that it was Belle, but it was not. Instead, it was Belle's daughter! Scrooge saw that Belle was sitting next to her daughter by the fire. She was a little older now, but still beautiful. Scrooge could hear the noise of other children in the room. There were many children, and they all laughed and played loudly. Instead of being angry, however, the mother and daughter enjoyed the noisy children and laughed at their games. Belle's oldest daughter went to play with her brothers and sisters. Scrooge had never seen such a beautiful young girl. She looked just like Belle, when Belle was young!</p>

	<p>Soon they heard a knock at the door. The children held their older sister's hands and dragged her over to their father, who had just come home. A man was with him, and his arms were full of Christmas toys and gifts! The deliveryman was attacked by the happy children, who reached into his pockets, grabbed all the gifts, put their arms around his neck, and kicked his legs excitedly! The children, of course, were very happy to receive their presents. Everyone had a terrible shock when Belle caught the baby putting a doll's toy into his mouth. Had the baby swallowed the little object? No, the toy was rescued just in time! There was much joy and laugher in that room on that Christmas evening. But soon the little children grew tired and each went up to bed. What a wonderful day it had been!</p>

	<p>Scrooge watched as Belle put the baby to bed. She went downstairs and sat next to the fire. Her husband was there, and their oldest daughter was sitting with him.</p>

	<p>"I saw a friend of yours today, Belle!" said her husband.</p>

	<p>"Who was it?" Belle asked.</p>

	<p>"Guess!" said her husband.</p>

	<p>"I can't guess," said Belle, laughing. "Oh, all right&#160;... Mr Scrooge?"</p>

	<p>"That's right, my dear!" cried the husband. "I passed his office and saw him through the window, working. Why is he working on Christmas? I think Mr Scrooge is alone in this world!"</p>

	<p>"Ghost of Christmas Past, take me away from this place!" cried Scrooge in a sad voice. He felt that his heart was breaking!</p>

	<p>"I told you that I would show you your past. This is what it is&#151;do not blame me if you are unhappy!" said the Ghost.</p>

	<p>"Take me away!" said Scrooge. "I can't stand it anymore!"</p>

	<p>He saw the Ghost looking at him. Somehow, it seemed to Scrooge that in the Ghost's face, he saw all the faces of his past. The light from the Ghost's head was brighter than ever.</p>

	<p>"Leave me alone! Take me back to my house!" cried Scrooge.</p>

	<p>Suddenly he saw the Ghost's cap in its hand. He suddenly felt that he had to put out the Ghost's light&#151;it seemed as if he could not stop looking at it! Scrooge grabbed the cap and put it over the Ghost's head. The Ghost did not try to stop him. The Ghost's body seemed to disappear, but no matter how hard Scrooge pushed the cap down, the bright light remained!</p>

	<p>Suddenly everything went dark.</p>
