	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER FOURTEEN</p>

	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">A Pair of English Scissors</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">F</span>ouqu&#xE9;'s offer had taken all Julien's pleasure away. He could not decide how to begin. He wrote a very detailed plan. First, he must give her a kiss.</p>

	<p>He was foolish, though. Mr de R&#x00EA;nal almost caught him, and Mrs de R&#x00EA;nal was shocked. "This man is very smart, but he does not know anything about women," she thought, "Could it be that he has never made love?"</p>

	<p>After lunch Mrs de R&#x00EA;nal had a visit from Mr de Maugiron. She was working on her sewing when Julien touched her foot with his. She dropped her sewing and scissors to hide his action.</p>

	<p>"You have to be careful," Mrs de R&#x00EA;nal said.</p>

	<p>Julien felt foolish, so he decided to go to Verri&#xE8;res to visit the priest. Father Ch&#x00E9;lan had been dismissed from his office and a priest named Maslon had replaced him. Julien helped the old priest move. Later he wrote a letter to Fouqu&#x00E9; saying that this injustice showed him that the church might not be a good place. This would give him a way out of his plans if he decided on the easy life.</p>
