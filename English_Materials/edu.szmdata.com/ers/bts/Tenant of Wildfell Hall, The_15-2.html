	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER FIFTEEN</p>

	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">A Meeting and its Effects</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">T</span>he next evening, I walked out to the hill to sit. My heart was broken; I could think of nothing but Helen all day. Soon, I heard a little voice&#151;</p>

	<p>"Mr Markham, Mamma wants you."</p>

	<p>"Wants me, Arthur? I'm busy just now."</p>

	<p>"Gilbert, I must speak with you!" said she anxiously, "Only for a moment, please."</p>

	<p>"Well, Mrs Graham." said I, calmly and coldly.</p>

	<p>"I won't ask why your behaviour has changed, Gilbert," she said bitterly. "I can bear the suspicions from everyone else, but not from you. Why did you not come to hear my explanation the other day?"</p>

	<p>"Because, I found out your secret!"</p>

	<p>"Impossible! I would have told you everything!" she cried. "But now I won't!"</p>

	<p>"Why not?"</p>

	<p>"Because, you don't understand me, or you would have listened to my story. Go! I won't care what you think of me!"</p>

	<p>She turned away, and I left. I looked back at her as I walked away, and saw that she was looking for me. After I returned home, I regretted leaving her so soon. She did love me&#151;probably she was tired of Mr Lawrence, and wished to part with him to be with me. And, I was still curious to know what explanation she would give me.</p>

	<p>The next evening, I went to see her.</p>

	<p>"Why have you come, Mr Markham?" she asked coldly.</p>

	<p>"Well, I have come to hear your explanation."</p>

	<p>"I will not tell you. I will not be angered, Mr Markham!" she cried.</p>

	<p>"I did not come to anger you. I have been a fool, ignoring everything I have heard about you, till I found that you lied to me."</p>

	<p>"What lie, sir?"</p>

	<p>"The last night I was here, I left you crying. I turned back to see how you were. Soon enough, I saw you walk into the garden with your friend."</p>

	<p>"Would you be very glad," she said with a smile, "to find that you were mistaken in your conclusion?"</p>

	<p>"How can you ask it, Helen?"</p>

	<p>She immediately went to her desk, and tore several pages from a thick notebook, then threw the pages into my hand, saying, "Take them home with you, and bring them back when you've finished. Don't say anything to anyone else."</p>

	<p>I left, eager to find out her secrets. I have it now, and though you cannot, of course, read it, I'll explain.</p>
