	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">A</span>fter a long three-day journey, they arrived in London. The girls were quite pleased with Mrs Jennings' home, which was quite handsome and large. As dinner would not be served for two hours after their arrival, Elinor immediately sat down to write to her mother. In a few moments, Marianne sat down to write, as well. "I am writing home, Marianne," said Elinor, "it would be better if you wrote in a day or two."</p>

	<p>"I am not going to write to my mother," replied Marianne hurriedly. Elinor said no more, as she realized Marianne was writing to Willoughby. She was surprised at the secrecy of Marianne's letter, and supposed the two were, indeed, engaged.</p>

	<p>Marianne was rather upset all evening, intent on listening to each carriage pass by the door, hoping each one was Willoughby coming to see her. Finally, late in the evening, someone came to the door.</p>

	<p>"Oh Elinor, it is Willoughby! I know it is!" she exclaimed, just as Colonel Brandon appeared.</p>

	<p>Marianne was too shocked to be polite, and immediately left the room.</p>

	<p>Colonel Brandon saw her leave, knowing he had caused such pain. However, he tried not to show his suffering.</p>

	<p>"Is your sister ill?" he asked.</p>

	<p>Elinor replied politely that Marianne was feeling a bit tired after the long journey. Elinor was disappointed that Willoughby had not come, but she was pleased to see Colonel Brandon, as she regarded him as a dear friend.</p>

	<p>For the next few days, Marianne was nervously checking the mail and waiting near the door, hoping Willoughby would soon come. He, unfortunately, did not come.</p>
