	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER ELEVEN</p>

	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">The Minister Again</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">T</span>hree weeks passed. Mrs Graham and I were now dear friends&#151;or brother and sister as we often said. She called me Gilbert, which I adored, and I called her Helen; I had once seen her name written in her books. I dared not go visit her more than twice a week.</p>

	<p>"Where are you going, Gilbert?" asked Rose one evening.</p>

	<p>"To take a walk," I replied.</p>

	<p>"Do you always dress so well and brush your hair to take a walk?" she paused, "You're going to Wildfell Hall, aren't you?"</p>

	<p>"Of course not! I haven't been there in six weeks! Why are you so interested in my visits to Wildfell Hall?"</p>

	<p>"I've heard so much about her lately. The minister and the Wilsons, besides Mamma, speak of her often. They say she is not a proper lady."</p>

	<p>"I suppose if I did not know her, I would believe those lies, but I do know her. You shouldn't believe such things, Rose."</p>

	<p>"Oh, Gilbert! You know nothing of her former life! Eliza Millward and Jane Wilson have told me that you go to visit Mrs Graham. They often secretly watch you as you go."</p>

	<p>At that moment, the minister entered the room. He cheerfully greeted Rose, then turned to me with a cruel look.</p>

	<p>"Well, sir!" said he, "you haven't come for a visit in over six weeks!"</p>

	<p>"Ah! I have been busy," I apologised.</p>

	<p>Just then, my mother came in to greet the minister.</p>

	<p>"I've gone to see Mrs Graham today," he told them.</p>

	<p>"Really!" exclaimed my mother.</p>

	<p>"She was quite cold, indeed. She refused to discuss anything about her life. I left, and will not return. My daughters will certainly not visit with her any longer. I suggest that you forbid your daughter from such visits, as well. As for your sons&#151;as for you, young man," he said as he turned to me.</p>

	<p>"As for me, sir," I began, but stopped. I immediately left the house. I walked in the direction of Wildfell Hall, although I did not know why. I had to see her, and speak to her.</p>
