	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE</p>

	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">First Weeks of the Marriage</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">F</span>ebruary 18th, 1822&#151;I am married now, and living as Mrs Huntingdon of Grassdale Manor. I have been married now for eight weeks. Do I regret having been married? No&#151;though I am a bit surprised at some of Arthur's behaviours. My duty now, however, is to love him and keep him from being careless and wild.</p>

	<p>He is very fond of me&#151;almost too fond. I wish that he would be more serious. I would prefer to be his friend rather than his pet. He can be quite selfish, but since I love him, I can forgive him for loving himself so much. He certainly likes to be pleased, and I am delighted to please him.</p>

	<p>I was quite shocked by something he said to me the other day. We were walking home from church one Sunday morning when he turned to me, looking quite serious.</p>

	<p>"Helen," he said, "I am not quite satisfied with you. You are too religious. You don't love me enough. Now, I am glad that you are religious, but you must love me more than your religion; I am your husband."</p>

	<p>"You are not a god, and I will not love you more if that means loving God less. Arthur, you do not love me as much as I love you. And, if you loved me less, but loved God more, I would be delighted," I said, looking quite upset.</p>

	<p>He then laughed and kissed my hand. We returned to the house and I went to my room, no longer wishing to speak to him about such matters.</p>
