	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER FOUR</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">T</span>he following day I visited the British hospital again to look for Miss Barkley. Her boss told me that she was out working at the front, because the war had started again. I was told that she would be back after seven o'clock.</p>

	<p>"And when you come, don't let your Italian friends follow you here."</p>

	<p>I said goodbye to the woman and then drove over to the area where the battle was supposed to start. I stopped my ambulance at the dressing station at the front of the mountain and crossed the river in a little boat. I then walked through an area that had once been a little town. It was now nothing but dirt. Finally, I found my way to the trenches where everybody was hiding. It was very messy and smelly. I talked with a captain I recognized for a short time and then went back.</p>

	<p>As I drove back to town, I took a good look at the new road the Italian Army was building. My unit planned to attack the Austrians as soon as the construction was finished. It was designed so that we could safely take wounded prisoners from the battlefield to the hospitals. Unfortunately, the very last part of the road seemed terribly dangerous, for it was in clear view of the Austrian trenches. I did not look forward to driving that part of the road. The pick-up area, however, was very safe. It helped me to feel better about the approaching fight. Getting back on the old road, I was stopped by the Italian police, because a bomb had recently fallen nearby. They cleared the road for me and I then continued on. As I drove toward Gorizia, several other bombs exploded in the distance, leaving clouds of grey smoke, and filling my nose with their special smell.</p>

	<p>After a very brief dinner, I went to the British hospital to look for Miss Barkley again. I found her in the garden with Miss Ferguson. They both greeted me with big smiles. After only a few minutes, Miss Ferguson mentioned that she needed to write her family and then left us alone.</p>

	<p>"I like her. She's a good woman," I said.</p>

	<p>"Oh yes, very good," Miss Barkley answered.</p>

	<p>"Are you both nurses?" I asked.</p>

	<p>"No, she is. I'm V. A. D, which is almost like being a nurse, only we have less experience. We only get to do real medical work when the fighting is pretty bad. Right now we're not allowed to leave the hospital, unless it's for work."</p>

	<p>"Can I visit you?"</p>

	<p>"Of course!"</p>

	<p>"Why don't you and I leave this war?"</p>

	<p>"Sounds good to me!" She looked at me closely. It was dark now. I liked the way she looked and gently took hold of her hand. Then I moved closer and put my arm around her.</p>

	<p>"Please, don't&#160;...&#160;!" She said.</p>

	<p>"What's wrong? Come on!" I got closer to her and kissed her. Suddenly I felt a pain in my face. She had hit me. My eyes began to gather water, but I did not cry.</p>

	<p>"I apologize, Henry!" she said, "I didn't mean it. I wasn't even thinking!"</p>

	<p>I wanted to hit her back, but I managed to stop myself. I knew that I was still in control. There was a good chance that I could be successful with her.</p>

	<p>"Hey, never mind. It's quite all right. I probably deserved it," I said, "It helped us forget the war for a moment! Didn't it?"</p>

	<p>"You are so cute. I want to kiss you now."</p>

	<p>I bent over her and began to kiss her, but she kept her mouth closed. I spent the whole time trying to open it, but she would not give up. I held her more tightly and then I could feel her shaking suddenly. I realized then that she was crying.</p>

	<p>"Dear, are you going to be good to me?" She asked.</p>

	<p>Her question annoyed me, but I tried to comfort her anyway. I accompanied her to the front door of her building and then said goodbye.</p>

	<p>When I got back to my room, Rinaldi was there reading in bed. He looked up from his book and asked, "How is it going with Miss Barkley?"</p>

	<p>"We are just common friends," I answered.</p>

	<p>"Hm. You look to me like a dog when it finds a suitable partner."</p>

	<p>I told him to shut up and then pushed over his candle and got into bed. He relit the candle and continued to enjoy his book.</p>
