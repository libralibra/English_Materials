	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER TWO</p>

	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">Entry into Society</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">J</span>ulien was astonished by the beauty of the house. "Be careful," Father Pirard said. "If you act like a peasant, they will treat you like one."</p>

	<p>Julien became calm. "I challenge them to," he said.</p>

	<p>They walked through the house and found a small, thin man. Father Pirard introduced Julien to Marquis de la Mole. At first, Julien was not impressed by the marquis, and he stared at him like a picture. Julien soon realized that this man was even more civil and nice than the Bishop of Besan&#xE7;on. The interview was over in three minutes.</p>

	<p>Father Pirard and Julien left the home, and Father Pirard gave his student a letter. "This is from the marquis," Father Pirard said. "He likes to do things himself, but soon you will do them for him. Go to this tailor and buy some new clothes."</p>

	<p>When Julien returned to Hotel de la Mole, the marquis showed him his new room. The marquis asked Julien how many shirts he bought.</p>

	<p>"Two," Julien said. He was surprised this great man would think about such a little thing.</p>

	<p>"Fine, fine," the marquis said. "Go buy twenty-two more. Here's the first part of your salary."</p>

	<p>How could I dislike it here? Julien thought. Mr de R&#x00EA;nal would be ashamed to help me like Marquis de la Mole just did.</p>

	<p>Julien was taken to the library where he would work. Julien was astonished by the number of books. I'll be able to read all of these! He thought. First I'll do my work.</p>

	<p>Julien finished his writing quickly. The marquis came in and looked sadly at his work. "Possible," he said, "is spelled with a double s. Please use the dictionary if you don't know how to spell a word."</p>

	<p>That evening Julien was introduced in the salon. There were many people there. Julien was happy to see the Bishop of Agde, who was so nice to him back in Verri&#x00E8;res. The Bishop did not recognize the peasant. Mrs de la Mole did not even look at him.</p>

	<p>Soon a handsome young man entered the room. He had a very small head. Julien realized this man was Count Norbert. Count Norbert seemed very nice. He also saw a young woman. Although she had beautiful eyes, they seemed very cold. Julien did not think she was attractive. He soon learned that this woman was Ms Mathilde de la Mole. To Julien she looked cruel, just like her mother. Marquis de la Mole just looked bored.</p>

	<p>"Norbert," said Marquis de la Mole, "I want you to be nice to this man, Mr Julien Sorel. I've just hired him, and I want to make him into somebody if at all possible."</p>

	<p>The marquis told the crowd about Julien's education, and a man from the university asked him questions about Horace. This is how I won over the Bishop of Besan&#xE7;on, Julien thought. These people only know one writer!</p>

	<p>Julien spoke in perfect Latin, and the people were impressed. He had a long conversation with the professor. Julien was an expert on Horace, Tacitus, and other ancient writers, but he knew nothing of modern names like King George IV and the poets Lord Byron and Robert Southey. The professor said to the marquise, "His manners are not good, but perhaps he is a learned man." The marquise did not think about Julien, but she was happy she invited the professor. The marquise liked anyone that entertained her husband.</p>
