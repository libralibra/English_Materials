	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE</p>

	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">The Master of the "Tankadere" Runs Great Risk of Losing a Reward of Two Hundred Pounds</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">T</span>he voyage of eight hundred miles was dangerous for such a small boat. Since he was being paid by the day, the master could have made a lot of money by taking his passengers to Yokohama. But John Bunsby was not that foolish.</p>

	<p>"Please use all possible speed," said Phineas Fogg, when they got into the open sea.</p>

	<p>"Trust me, sir. We are going as fast as we can."</p>

	<p>"It is your occupation, not mine, and I trust you."</p>

	<p>Phineas Fogg stood straight up with his legs apart, like a sailor. He stared at the water. The young woman was a little nervous to be on such a small boat.</p>

	<p>Night came. The pilot put out his lights. Many boats were heading towards land, and an accident could destroy the small ship.</p>

	<p>Fix did not talk to the other passengers. He was thinking of the future. It seemed certain that Fogg would not stop at Yokohama, but would take the boat for San Francisco. America was so big that Fogg would be safe. Instead of sailing directly from England to the United States, like a common thief, he had traveled most of the planet. Once in the United States, what should Fix do? Should he stop following him? No! It was his duty. There was one thing to be thankful for; Passepartout was not with his master.</p>

	<p>Phineas was also thinking of Passepartout, who had so strangely disappeared. It seemed possible that the man might have boarded the Carnatic by mistake. This was also Aouda's opinion. She missed Passepartout very much. They might find him at Yokohama.</p>

	<p>A strong wind started at ten o'clock. It would have been safer to head for land, but the pilot studied the skies and went ahead. Everything was prepared for high speed. Mr Fogg and Aouda went to the room at midnight. The pilot and the crew remained on deck all night.</p>

	<p>At sunrise the next day, which was 8th November, the boat had made more than one hundred miles. The Tankadere was still at her highest speed. If the wind held, the chances would be good. During the day they kept close to the coast.</p>

	<p>Mr Fogg and Aouda were not affected by the rough sea, and they ate well. Mr Fix was invited to join them, and he did sadly. He did not like to eat this man's food, but he had to eat.</p>

	<p>When the meal was over, he said to Mr Fogg, "Sir, you have been very kind to me. I must ask to pay my share&#151;"</p>

	<p>"Let us not speak of that, sir," replied Mr Fogg.</p>

	<p>"But, if I insist&#151;"</p>

	<p>"No, sir," repeated Mr Fogg.</p>

	<p>Fix did not talk for the rest of the day.</p>

	<p>Meanwhile they were traveling quickly, and John Bunsby was in high hope. The crew worked hard, expecting a good reward. They worked as hard as they would in an important race.</p>

	<p>By evening they had traveled two hundred and twenty miles, and Mr Fogg thought they might reach Yokohama without a single delay in his journal.</p>

	<p>At daybreak the wind blew hard again, and it looked like a storm was coming. John Bunsby studied the sky for a long time. At last he said to Mr Fogg, "Shall I speak out, sir?"</p>

	<p>"Of course."</p>

	<p>"Well, we are going to have a storm."</p>

	<p>"Is the wind north or south?" asked Mr Fogg quietly.</p>

	<p>"South. Look! A Typhoon is coming up."</p>

	<p>"Glad it's a typhoon from the south, for it will carry us forward."</p>

	<p>"If you take it that way," said John Bunsby, "I've nothing more to say."</p>

	<p>The pilot prepared for the worst. He took away all but a single, heavy sail.</p>

	<p>John Bunsby asked his passengers to go below, but they did not want to be downstairs in such a storm. Neither Mr Fogg, Fix, nor Aouda left the deck.</p>

	<p>The storm of rain and wind came on at eight o'clock. The single sail took them faster than a train going full speed. The boat moved northward the whole day. Huge waves almost knocked them over, but the pilot saved them. As for Phineas Fogg, it seemed just as if the typhoon were part of his program.</p>

	<p>So far the wind had pointed them north, but towards the evening the wind came from the northwest. The waves hit the boat, and the boat rolled terribly. John Bunsby talked to his crew, and then he said to Mr Fogg, "I think, sir, that we should go to one of the ports on the coast."</p>

	<p>"I think so too."</p>

	<p>"Ah!" said the pilot. "But which one?"</p>

	<p>"I know of but one," replied Mr Fogg.</p>

	<p>"And that is&#151;"</p>

	<p>"Shanghai."</p>

	<p>The pilot did not understand at first. He could barely recognize such determination. Then he cried, "Well&#151;yes! You're right. To Shanghai!"</p>

	<p>So the Tankadere stayed on her northward track.</p>

	<p>The night was terrible. Aouda was very tired, but she did not say anything. More than once Mr Fogg rushed to protect her from the waves.</p>

	<p>Day came. The storm was still terrible, but the wind returned to the southeast. It was a good change, and the Tankadere rushed forward again. At noon the sea began to calm down, and the passengers could now eat a little. The night was mostly quiet. The boat moved very quickly. The next morning at dawn they saw the coast, and John Bunsby said they were one hundred miles from Shanghai. A hundred miles, and only one day left! That evening Mr Fogg was due at Shanghai.</p>

	<p>The wind grew calmer. At noon the Tankadere was within forty-five miles of Shanghai. There were still six hours left. The wind grew calmer, but John Bunsby used every part of the wind. At six o'clock they were not more than ten miles from the mouth of the Shanghai River. At seven they were still three miles from Shanghai.</p>

	<p>At this moment, a cloud of smoke appeared. It was the American steamer, leaving for Yokohama.</p>

	<p>"Signal her!" said Phineas Fogg quietly.</p>

	<p>A small cannon on the front of the deck was loaded. They raised the flag halfway, which meant they needed help.</p>

	<p>"Fire!" said Mr Fogg.</p>

	<p class="i_ar">(end of section)</p>
