	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">Captain Nemo's Offer</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">O</span>n the 28th of January, I went up to the platform and noticed a group of mountains about two thousand feet high. I soon discovered that we were near an island off the coast of India. This island was famous for its pearls, deep under the nearby waters.</p>

	<p>"Would you like to see those beds of pearls?" the captain asked.</p>

	<p>"Certainly, Captain."</p>

	<p>"We will see the beds of pearls, but we will not see men fishing for them, as the season for pearl fishing has not yet begun. But, Professor Aronnax, you are not afraid of sharks, correct?"</p>

	<p>"Sharks!" I exclaimed.</p>

	<p>"I am not familiar with those types of fish," I responded, trying to hide my fear.</p>

	<p>"We are familiar with them," replied Captain Nemo, "and you will be soon, as well. But, we shall also have our weapons with us. So, I will see you early tomorrow morning, sir." Captain Nemo then left me.</p>

	<p>Some oyster shells have been found with over one hundred pearls inside. These lovely wonders are produced when a grain of sand reaches the inside of the shell, and the pearl builds around that grain of sand year after year. The fishermen pull apart these shells to find the pearls inside. The oyster cannot survive in the open air, and usually dies after a few days. The pearls are priced depending on their size and color. Thinking about our sea adventure the next day, I was still quite worried about meeting sharks while in the sea, their own home. Conseil and Ned Land did not share my worries, however, and so I decided I must be brave.</p>
