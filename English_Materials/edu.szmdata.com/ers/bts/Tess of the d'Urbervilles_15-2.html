	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER FIFTEEN</p>

	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">A New Temptation</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">T</span>his was the first time Tess had seen d'Urberville since she had left Trantridge. Even though he was a minister now, she still felt very afraid of him. His clothes were different. He did not have a moustache and his face looked different. But Tess did not believe that he had really changed his evil thoughts and actions.</p>

	<p>She quickly moved away so he would not see her, but he noticed Tess. His voice faded and his eyes dropped. He looked confused. Tess walked down the road very fast. She could feel him looking at her. Now she knew she couldn't escape her past. She would be reminded of her past until she died. As she walked, she heard someone walking behind her. When she turned around, she saw the one person who she had hoped never to see again.</p>

	<p>"Tess," said d'Urberville. "It's me, Alec."</p>

	<p>"I know who you are," said Tess coldly.</p>

	<p>They walked up a hill together.</p>

	<p>"You may want to know why I'm following you. I want to save you from hell."</p>

	<p>"Are you saved?" Tess asked.</p>

	<p>"God has helped me. I want to tell you how I became good. Have you heard of a minister named Mr Clare? He is a strict, good man who lives in Emminster."</p>

	<p>"I have heard of him."</p>

	<p>"He came to Trantridge and tried to show me how evil I was. I was bad to him, but later my mother died. I thought about what he had said. Now I only want to help other people become good, too."</p>

	<p>"Stop!" shouted Tess. "I don't believe you have changed. I hate you for saying these things to me. You ruined my life. You have some fun and now you are saved." As she said these things, she looked him in the eyes.</p>

	<p>"Don't look at me with such hatred," said d'Urberville. "Women still have too much power over me. You are very beautiful. If you look at me it might be dangerous for you."</p>

	<p>They came to a crossroads. There was a strange stone there. It was a lonely place that people did not like. They stopped there.</p>

	<p>"I must turn right. I am speaking to a crowd at six o'clock this evening. What has your life been like since we last met?"</p>

	<p>Tess told him about their baby. Alec was very surprised.</p>

	<p>"You should have told me. I could have helped you. Before we part, put your hand on this stone. It was once a holy stone. Swear that you will never tempt me to be wicked. I'm afraid of the power you have over me."</p>

	<p>"How could you say that," shouted Tess. "I don't want to see you ever again."</p>

	<p>"Please, swear you will not tempt me."</p>

	<p>Tess did as she was asked.</p>

	<p>"I will pray for you. We might meet again," said Alec.</p>

	<p>Tess walked down the street still upset. She met a man on the road. He told her that the cross actually marked the spot where a criminal had been killed. This made her feel afraid. Finally, she reached the farm.</p>

	<p>The next week, Alec d'Urberville came to see Tess. She was working in the fields. He told her that he would see his house in Trantridge and go help poor people in Africa.</p>

	<p>"Come with me and be my wife. Help me make right the bad thing I did to you," he said.</p>

	<p>"No," said Tess.</p>

	<p>"Why not?" d'Urberville still felt desire for Tess. He was very disappointed.</p>

	<p>"You know that I don't love you," she said. "I am in love with someone else."</p>

	<p>"Maybe your feelings are not real."</p>

	<p>"They are real. I have married him."</p>

	<p>Alec looked unhappy.</p>

	<p>"Please don't tell anyone," begged Tess. "No one here knows."</p>

	<p>"Who is he?" asked d'Urberville. "Where is he now? Only a bad husband would leave you to work like this."</p>

	<p>Tess' eyes flashed.</p>

	<p>"Your eyes," whispered Alec. "I didn't think I felt things for you anymore, but I was wrong." He grabbed Tess' hands, but she pulled away.</p>

	<p>"Go away. Respect me and my husband."</p>

	<p>"Don't worry, Tess. I can control myself. I thought that if we got married it would take away the bad in both of us."</p>

	<p>"That plan will not work." Alec slowly walked away.</p>

	<p>The farmer came to talk to Tess. He was angry that she had wasted time and talked to a stranger. Tess preferred this angry man to Alec d'Urberville's sweet words.</p>

	<p>She did imagine escaping her hard life and moving to Africa with Alec. But she rejected the idea.</p>

	<p>That night she wrote a letter to Angel. She told him about her love for him, but she could not finish this letter either. She remembered his offer to Izz.</p>

	<p>One Sunday in February Tess was eating lunch. Alec d'Urberville knocked at the door, ran in and fell into a chair.</p>

	<p>"Tess, I can't stop thinking of you. Pray for me."</p>

	<p>"I don't think God would change his plans for you just because I wanted him, too," Tess said. She didn't feel bad for Alec.</p>

	<p>"What does your husband believe?"</p>

	<p>Tess explained Angel's beliefs. Alec watched Tess speak.</p>

	<p>"You just believe what he says. All women are just the same," said Alec.</p>

	<p>"He knows everything," said Tess. "Anything that is good enough for him is good enough for me, too."</p>

	<p>"Interesting. Maybe he knows more than Minister Clare. Maybe believing only in the Bible and religion is bad. Maybe I shouldn't have become a minister. I am supposed to speak at two o'clock today, but I am here. You have too much power over me."</p>

	<p>"You are letting a lot of people down," said Tess.</p>

	<p>"I don't care. You are the woman I always wanted. You are a temptation away from God. I cannot resist you." Alec moved towards Tess.</p>

	<p>"Stop!" shouted Tess. "I am married. I cannot defend myself."</p>

	<p>Alec stopped. He left and didn't say anything. He thought about Angel's beliefs. "Her husband doesn't know that his ideas may lead me back to Tess," he laughed.</p>

	<p>In March, it was harvest time. The farmer gave Tess the hardest job of all. She couldn't rest much. At lunchtime, she noticed d'Urberville walking towards her. He was not dressed like a minister. He looked like his old self.</p>

	<p>He smiled at Tess. "I am back."</p>

	<p>"Why are you following me?"</p>

	<p>"You are on my mind. I see you night and day. Tess, when you told me about our child my feelings for you became strong. I don't want to be a minister and it is your fault."</p>

	<p>Tess was shocked.</p>

	<p>"I stopped speaking to crowds. They were stupid to listen to a minister. Your wonderful husband is right. Now I am just like I used to be."</p>

	<p>"You should have stayed a minister," Tess said.</p>

	<p>"You explained your husband's ideas so well, that I agree with him. Tess, you need help. I am here and your husband is not. My carriage is here and we can leave together. You tempted me, now we should share a life together."</p>

	<p>Alec held Tess. She was very angry, but said nothing. She hit him on the face. Alec wiped blood from his mouth.</p>

	<p>He could barely keep his anger in. "Remember, Tess. If you are anyone's wife, you are mine. I will have you again."</p>

	<p>Alec left and work began again. Tess was very tired. Alec d'Urberville had been waiting for this. He returned and stood next to her.</p>

	<p>"You are weak," he said. He held her arm. "I told the farmer he shouldn't use you for such hard work. I will walk you home."</p>

	<p>Tess was too tired to be afraid. "You can be kind. And you wanted to make things right and marry me."</p>

	<p>"I can help you even if I can't marry you. You must trust me. I have enough money to make you and your family happy and comfortable."</p>

	<p>"Have you seen them?" asked Tess. "They need help, but I can't take anything from you. Please leave."</p>

	<p>When she returned to her room she wrote Angel a letter. It said:</p>

	<p>Dear Husband,</p>

	<p>I need your help. There is no one else. I am open to temptation. I cannot say who it is, but I need you to come to me now. Something bad might happen. I know you are far away, but I am in trouble. I need help. I deserve to be punished by you, but please be kind to me. I would die for you. Please come.</p>

	<p>I live for you only. I am lonely without you, but I am not bitter.</p>

	<p>Don't you still love me even a little? I am the same woman you loved at the dairy. When I met you, my bad past died. Don't you understand this?</p>

	<p>I was a fool to believe that you would always love me. People say I am still beautiful, but I don't care because you are not here.</p>

	<p>If you won't come to me, can I visit you? Save me from the evil that is so close to me.</p>

	<p>Love,</p>

	<p>Your faithful, heartbroken Tess</p>
