	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER ELEVEN</p>

	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">In the Evening</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">J</span>ulien returned that evening. The garden was very dark. He tried to take Mrs de R&#x00EA;nal's hand, but she refused. Just then, Mr de R&#x00EA;nal came out. The mayor was talking about politics. Julien thought he should take Mrs de R&#x00EA;nal's hand while Mr de R&#x00EA;nal was sitting nearby. She let him, and he began kissing her hand all over.</p>

	<p>Mrs de R&#x00EA;nal felt weak. Goodness! She said to herself. Could I be in love? I'm married and I've fallen in love! But I've never felt this way with my husband.</p>

	<p>For one moment Julien forgot ambition and only thought of Mrs de R&#x00EA;nal's beauty. He did not feel love, though. Thinking about Napoleon's victories gave him an idea. "I've won a battle", he said to himself, "and I must continue and hurt this man's pride". I will ask for three days off to see my friend Fouqu&#x00E9;.</p>

	<p>That night Mrs de R&#x00EA;nal could not sleep. She felt alive, but then she remembered that it was a sin to love a man who wasn't her husband. Her pure love was now something ugly, and she felt very guilty. Her worries made her ill, and she decided she would be cold to Julien next time.</p>
