	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER FOUR</p>

	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">A Young Man Wronged</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">M</span>r Collins' did not change his plan after he saw the five Bennet daughters. Jane's lovely face proved to him that his idea had been a good idea. From the first evening of his stay, she became his settled choice. The next morning before breakfast, however, Mrs Bennet told him to be cautious about making Jane as his wife. She told Mr Collins that Jane already had another wealthy man who was interested in marrying her.</p>

	<p>Mr Collins then decided to change from Jane to Elizabeth&#151;and this was soon done. Mrs Bennet was hopeful that soon she would have two married daughters.</p>

	<p>After breakfast, all the Bennet girls decided to walk into Meryton. Mr Collins was asked to join them, at the request of Mr Bennet. He wanted to get rid of Mr Collins so that he could have his library to himself. Earlier, Mr Collins had followed him into the library and talked without stopping about his house and garden at Hunsford. Though prepared to put up with foolishness and pride in every other room, Mr Bennet did not stand for such behavior in his library.</p>

	<p>Mr Collins' speech was very proud all the way to Meryton. When they reached Meryton, the attention of the sisters was drawn away from him.</p>

	<p>There was a young man, whom they had never seen, walking with an officer on the other side of the road. The officer was Mr Denny. They knew him well. Kitty and Lydia, pretending to want something from a nearby shop, crossed the street. They had just reached the other side of the road when the two gentlemen reached the same spot. Mr Denny asked permission to introduce his friend, Mr Wickham. Mr Wickham had just decided to join the military as an army soldier. The sisters expressed their view that Mr Wickham would be most charming if he were to dress in uniform.</p>

	<p>The party was talking together very nicely when they heard the sound of horses. Darcy and Bingley were riding down the street towards them. Bingley was looking at Jane, but Mr Darcy decided not to look at Elizabeth. They were suddenly surprised by the sight of Mr Wickham. Elizabeth noticed that both Mr Darcy's and Mr Bingley's faces changed color: one looked white, the other red. After a few moments, Mr Wickham touched his hat&#151;Mr Darcy had no choice but to return his greeting.</p>

	<p>Then Mr Bingley rode on with his friend.</p>

	<p>Mr Denny and Mr Wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of Mr Philips' house. Then they said their goodbyes. Mrs Philips, always glad to see her nieces, received Mr Collins most politely. Some of the officers were going to dine the next day with the Philipses. Their aunt promised to invite Mr Wickham as well.</p>

	<p>As they were walking home to Longbourn, Elizabeth told Jane what she had seen. She wondered why Mr Wickham had caused such surprise, but Jane had no explanation for this behavior.</p>

	<p>The coach took Mr Collins and his five cousins to Meryton. When they arrived, the girls were delighted to hear that Mr Wickham had also accepted their uncle's invitation.</p>

	<p>When Mr Wickham entered the house, Elizabeth was struck by his handsomeness. He sat beside her and after a while he asked, in an uncomfortable way, how long Mr Darcy had been in town.</p>

	<p>"About a month," said Elizabeth. "I understand he has a very large property in Derbyshire."</p>

	<p>"Yes," replied Wickham. "I have known his family since my childhood."</p>

	<p>Elizabeth looked surprised.</p>

	<p>"I guess you are surprised, Miss Bennet. We did greet each other very coldly yesterday. To tell you the truth, I do not think of him as my friend."</p>

	<p>"He can be a very disagreeable man," said Elizabeth.</p>

	<p>"His father was a very good man, and the truest friend I ever had. You see, I should have been working for the church. If this had happened, I would now have a very good and valuable way of living. However, Mr Darcy, made my good fortune impossible to happen."</p>

	<p>"Indeed!"</p>

	<p>"Yes&#151;his father wanted me to have his property and wealth. He was my godfather, and wanted to provide well for me. But after his death, his property was given elsewhere."</p>

	<p>"Good heavens!" cried Elizabeth. "Why wasn't his will followed?"</p>

	<p>"A certain part of the will was very unclear. Or, at least, Mr Darcy chose to make it unclear. The property was given to someone else. We are very different sort of men, me and Mr Darcy, and he hates me!"</p>

	<p>"He deserves to be publicly punished!"</p>

	<p>"He will be; but not by me. Because I remember the kindness of his father, I will never do something to hurt his family!"</p>

	<p>"But why did he behave so cruelly?" she asked.</p>

	<p>"Jealousy," replied Mr Wickham. "My father was a lawyer. He did much to be useful to the late Mr Darcy. He gave all his time and effort for taking care of the Pemberley property. He was also Mr Darcy's closest friend. Before my father died, Mr Darcy promised him he would provide for me. But his son's jealousy stopped him from doing so."</p>

	<p>"Even though I have never liked him, I never thought Mr Darcy would be as bad as this. How can Mr Bingley be friends with him? He must not be aware of what Mr Darcy has done."</p>

	<p>"Probably he is not. Mr Darcy can be a very nice friend if he thinks it is good for him. I know he takes care of his sister very carefully."</p>

	<p>"What kind of a girl is Miss Darcy?"</p>

	<p>"She's very, very proud, just like her brother. She is sixteen years old. Since her father's death, she has lived in London. A lady takes care of her education."</p>

	<p>Mr Wickham's attention was then caught by Mr Collins, who was talking about Lady Catherine de Bourgh, whose care he was under. He asked Elizabeth whether Mr Collins was a close friend of the de Bourgh family.</p>

	<p>"I do not know how Mr Collins was introduced to her," she replied, "but he has not known her for long."</p>

	<p>"Lady Catherine de Bourgh and Lady Anne Darcy were sisters. Lady Catherine is aunt to the present Mr Darcy."</p>

	<p>They continued talking together until supper. On her way home, Elizabeth could only think of Mr Wickham and what he had told her.</p>
