	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">F</span>or the next three or four days, Marianne heard nothing from Willoughby. He did not write, nor did he come for a visit. Soon enough, Lady Middleton requested that the two girls attend a party with her. Marianne was indifferent about all activities, and therefore, cared little about her appearance during the event. Upon arriving, she sat quietly, refusing to speak to anyone.</p>

	<p>The two girls had been sitting down for a short time when Elinor saw Willoughby, standing nearby, talking to a very fashionable-looking young woman. Willoughby then looked over; Elinor smiled, and he greeted her with a smile, as well, although he did not come to speak to her or Marianne. Elinor then turned to Marianne, to see whether she had noticed him, as well. At that moment, Marianne looked suddenly delighted, and would have gone to him immediately if her sister had not stopped her.</p>

	<p>"He is there&#151;he is there! Why does he not look at me? Why cannot I speak to him?" she exclaimed.</p>

	<p>At last, Willoughby came to them, but refused to look at Marianne, speaking only to Elinor. He hurriedly asked about Mrs Dashwood and their sister. After a few moments, however, Marianne, growing more upset, began to speak.</p>

	<p>"Good God! Willoughby, what is the matter? Have you not received my letters? Why are you not speaking to me?"</p>

	<p>He could no longer avoid looking at her. He turned to her, looking quite nervous, but spoke in a rather calm manner.</p>

	<p>"Yes, I did receive your notes informing me that you had arrived in town. I did go for a visit, but unfortunately you were out."</p>

	<p>"Willoughby! Tell me, what is the matter with you?"</p>

	<p>He did not reply, but looked quite embarrassed as he noticed the young woman he was speaking to earlier. "Yes, thank you for informing me that you have arrived in town," he said before hurriedly turning away.</p>

	<p>Marianne now looked rather pale, and sat in her chair looking discouraged.</p>

	<p>Willoughby soon left the party, and Elinor was relieved for her sister. Marianne desired to leave immediately, so Elinor informed Lady Middleton that Marianne was quite ill. They then returned home, and Marianne went to her room immediately, wishing only to be alone.</p>
