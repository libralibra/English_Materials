	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER FORTY-TWO</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">J</span>ohn Dashwood came for a short visit a few days later, before Elinor and Marianne would be going to Cleveland with the Palmers, Mrs Jennings and Colonel Brandon. Their brother congratulated them on traveling on so long a journey without any expense, as they would be going with the Palmers.</p>

	<p>Marianne was eager to leave London, as she had not had many hours of pleasure while there. She knew that Willoughby would now be busy making new plans without her. She thought about this without feeling too sad now.</p>

	<p>Elinor was anxious to leave, as well; she had no longer wished to see Lucy Steele, as the foolish girl had caused Elinor a great deal of pain and suffering. She wished to return to Barton quickly, and spend many quiet days with their mother, which she hoped would calm her sister.</p>

	<p>They arrived at Cleveland two days later. Marianne was delighted to be in the quiet country again, and spent her days walking around the area, sometimes crying, thinking that Willoughby's home was so close. Mrs Palmer was pleased that the Dashwood girls had come, and treated them with cheerful warmth. Her husband, as well, was quite a gentleman, and Elinor found him to be quite tender and caring, although he occasionally became upset with his wife and her mother.</p>

	<p>As Marianne spent long hours on walks outside, she quickly caught a cold. She was forced to stay indoors for the next day or two, till her health improved.</p>
