	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER THIRIEEN</p>

	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">Is it a Plot?</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">T</span>his is getting serious, thought Julien, and a little too obvious. Mathilde can talk to me in the library with total freedom, but going to her room puts me at complete risk. It's clear they want to hurt me or at least make fun of me.</p>

	<p>He packed his bags to leave. When he finished, he thought: What if Mathilde was in good faith? If I left, she'd think I am afraid. I'll lose the most beautiful woman of high society, and I won't defeat Marquis de Croisenois. I might be shot, but this is my only chance.</p>

	<p>Her letters! They'll think I have them with me. Marquis de Croisenois and Mr de Luz themselves will be there! I'll hide copies in the library. What if they try to kill me? No, I'll be ready! He thought, and he prepared his small guns.</p>

	<p>The bell rang for dinner, and Julien became very afraid. He studied the other people. Which ones will be there tonight? He looked for answers in Ms de la Mole's face, but he saw nothing. She looked like a queen; she was truly beautiful and impressive. It almost made him fall in love.</p>

	<p>He went to the garden and examined the ladder. This day it is mine to use, just like in Verri&#x00E8;res, he thought. How different this is! In Verri&#xE8;res I never had to fear the person for whom I took risks; now there's so much more danger.</p>

	<p>That evening was extremely painful.</p>
