	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER TWO</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">M</span>r Weston was born in Highbury, and spent his life living and working there. Everyone who knew him loved him dearly. Many years ago, he had been in military service, and was called Captain Weston. During that time, he met his first wife, Miss Churchill, who fell in love with him very quickly. The two married, but Miss Churchill's parents were not happy. They believed their daughter could marry someone with more wealth, but Miss Churchill had made her decision. Unfortunately, Miss Churchill soon missed the riches of her life as a Churchill.</p>

	<p>After three years, Mrs Weston died, and Mr Weston had a young child, Frank, to care for. However, Mrs Weston's parents, the Churchills, agreed to raise the boy as their son. Soon after, Mr Weston left the military. For the next eighteen to twenty years, he lived cheerfully in Highbury. He would spend his time doing what he pleased. Many years later, he met Miss Taylor, who he fell in love with and married.</p>

	<p>Mr Weston had planned for many years to buy a piece of land, which was called "Randalls." He decided that he would not marry again until he bought the land. He had never been an unhappy man, but after he bought Randalls and married again, he was content with his life.</p>

	<p>Mr Weston's son, Frank, had been living with the Churchills, and had never visited Highbury since. The people of Highbury were all curious to meet this young man. Young Frank had become a Churchill in every way, and when he became an adult, took the name Frank Churchill. Everyone in Highbury believed that Frank would come to visit for his father's wedding. Young Frank had written his new mother a letter, a handsome-looking letter that the townspeople talked of often.</p>

	<p>The new Mrs Weston was excited about her good fortune in marrying Mr Weston, but often thought of Emma. Mrs Weston knew Emma missed her, but believed Emma had a strong spirit.</p>
