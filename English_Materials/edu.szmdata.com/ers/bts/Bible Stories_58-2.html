	<p class="storyTitle">58. Lighting the Lamps</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">J</span>esus wanted the people to be ready to enter his kingdom when they died. He told the crowds many stories of how important it was to follow him when he called them.</p>

	<p>"Ten young women took their lamps and went to meet the bridegroom at a wedding. Five of them acted foolishly. They didn't take extra oil for the lamps in case they had to wait a long time. The other five were wise. They brought plenty of extra oil."</p>

	<p>"They all fell asleep as they waited, and suddenly someone yelled at them to come meet the bridegroom. It was the middle of the night. The five young women who did not bring extra oil found that their lamps went out. They could not see in the dark room."</p>

	<p>"The five wise ones told the foolish ones to buy more oil because they didn't have enough to share. When the foolish ones returned, the door was locked. The doorman turned them away from the feast."</p>

	<p>Jesus said that people must always be prepared to meet him, because they could not know when he might come for them.</p>
