	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE</p>

	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">The Coming Journey</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">W</span>hite Fang knew something bad was going to happen.</p>

	<p>"Listen to that!" said Matt one night. When he and Weeden Scott were eating supper, they were hearing a cry from outside the house. It was White Fang. Weeden Scott shouted. When White Fang heard Weeden Scott's voice, he was quiet. He wanted to be sure that his master was still in the house.</p>

	<p>"The wolf knows you will leave," said Matt.</p>

	<p>Weeden Scott looked at Matt. His face was very sad. He said, "I can't take a wolf to California. He would probably kill other people's dogs. Then, the police would take him and kill him."</p>

	<p>Matt nodded. Outside the house, White Fang started to cry again. "He definitely loves you," said Matt.</p>

	<p>Weeden Scott was suddenly angry. He shouted, "Shut up! I know what is best. I cannot take him with me!"</p>

	<p>Matt said, "I agree, but&#160;...&#160;"</p>

	<p>"But what?" said Weeden Scott.</p>

	<p>"Well, don't be angry!" said Matt. "It looks like you really don't know what to do about the wolf. You haven't decided yet. You have probably been thinking about it for a long time."</p>

	<p>Weeden Scott was quiet. In a calm voice, he said, "You're right. I really don't know what I should do with him, but it would be a mistake to take him with me.</p>

	<p>Matt agreed. He said, "I just don't understand how he knows that you will leave."</p>

	<p>"I don't know either," said Weeden Scott. "That wolf is too intelligent."</p>

	<p>The next day, White Fang saw Weeden Scott packing a suitcase. Therefore, he knew that his master was leaving. He knew that his master was not going to take him along. His sadness was unbearable.</p>

	<p>That night, he cried the entire night. Inside the house, the two men were preparing to sleep. They listened to White Fang's cries. Matt said, "He stopped eating again. He stopped eating when you left last time. This time he will probably die."</p>

	<p>"Oh, shut up!" shouted Weeden Scott.</p>

	<p>The next day, White Fang was very anxious and tense. When Weeden Scott left the house, he followed him closely. When he was inside the house, White Fang waited for him outside the door. Every time the door opened, White Fang could see the suitcases.</p>

	<p>A few hours later, two men came to the house. They took the suitcases. Matt helped them. When Matt came back to the house, White Fang was still outside the door waiting for his master. Weeden Scott then opened the door and let White Fang come inside. He gently touched White Fang. He said, "I'm sorry. I have to leave. You cannot come with me." White Fang pushed his head to his master's body. He wanted to hug him.</p>

	<p>Then, Matt said, "The ship is here. You have to go now. Hurry! Don't be late! I'll lock the door."</p>

	<p>They left White Fang inside the house. Then, they shut the door and locked it. They could hear White Fang crying. Weeden Scott said, "You must take good care of him. Write a letter to me and tell me how he is doing."</p>

	<p>"Sure," said Matt, "but just listen to him! He is so sad that you are leaving him!"</p>

	<p>The two men stopped talking and walking. They listened to White Fang cry. It was the saddest cry they had ever heard. It made the men feel extremely sad. It broke their hearts. Then, they began to sadly walk to the ship.</p>

	<p>They arrived at the ship. The ship was going from Canada to California. There were many people on the boat. Many of the people had come to Canada to look for gold, but they were not successful. Now, they were ready to go home. The two men were standing on the boat. They shook hands and said goodbye. Suddenly, they saw White Fang standing on the boat. They were shocked.</p>

	<p>"Did you lock the door?" said Weeden Scott.</p>

	<p>"Yes!" said Matt. He thought for a moment and said, "But I forgot to close the window! He used the window! I'm sorry. I'll take him back with me."</p>

	<p>Weeden Scott thought for a moment. Then he said, "No need, Matt. I have made a decision. I am taking him with me!"</p>

	<p>Matt smiled. "Good-bye!" he said. "Don't forget to cut his fur when the weather is hot."</p>

	<p>"Good-bye!" shouted Weeden Scott.</p>

	<p>After Matt left, Weeden Scott sat with White Fang. He looked at the dog and smiled. Then, he lovingly and gently touched the wolfs head and ears. "Growl for me!" he said.</p>
