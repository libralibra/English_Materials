	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER THIRTY</p>

	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">Phineas Fogg Simply Does His Duty</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">T</span>hree passengers including Passepartout had disappeared. Had they been killed? Were they taken prisoners by the Sioux?</p>

	<p>There were many wounded, but none killed. Colonel Proctor was hurt very badly. He fought bravely, and he was shot between his legs.</p>

	<p>Aouda was safe, and Phineas Fogg had not been hurt. Fix was slightly hurt, but Passepartout could not be found. Aouda cried and cried.</p>

	<p>Everyone got off the train. The wheels were red with blood. The last of the Sioux were disappearing in the south.</p>

	<p>Mr Fogg did not move. He had a serious decision to make. Aouda looked at him and said nothing, but he understood her. "I will find him, living or dead," he said quietly to Aouda.</p>

	<p>"Ah, Mr&#151;Mr Fogg!" she cried, and she grabbed his hands.</p>

	<p>Phineas Fogg had sacrificed himself. A single day would make him lose the steamer at New York, and he would lose his bet. But he thought, "It is my duty."</p>

	<p>The commanding officer of Fort Kearney was there.</p>

	<p>"Sir," said Mr Fogg to the officer, "three passengers have disappeared. Will you follow the Sioux?"</p>

	<p>"That's very serious. Can I risk the lives of fifty men to save three?"</p>

	<p>"I don't know whether you can, sir, but you ought to do so."</p>

	<p>"Nobody here," the officer replied, "has a right to teach me my duty."</p>

	<p>"Very well," said Mr Fogg, coldly. "I will go alone."</p>

	<p>"You, sir!" cried Fix. "You would go alone after the Indians?"</p>

	<p>"Sir, you shall not go alone," cried the officer. "You are a brave man." He called thirty men to join the search.</p>

	<p>"Will you let me come with you?" asked Fix.</p>

	<p>"Do as you please, sir. But if you wish to do me a favor, you will stay with Aouda. In case anything should happen to me&#151;"</p>

	<p>Fix did not know what to do. He had followed this man for so long. Would he let him go now?</p>

	<p>"I will stay," he said.</p>

	<p>A few minutes later, Mr Fogg left. But, before going, he said to the soldiers, "My friends, I will give you five thousand dollars if we save the prisoners."</p>

	<p>It was a little past noon.</p>

	<p>As Aouda waited she thought about Phineas Fogg. He had given up his fortune and risked his life for his servant.</p>

	<p>Fix thought differently. He felt foolish for letting Fogg go alone. He was very angry at himself.</p>

	<p>"I have been an idiot!" he thought. "This man has seen it. He has gone, and he won't come back!" He thought of following Fogg.</p>

	<p>At two o'clock a whistle was heard coming from the east. No train was expected from the east, and there was no time for other help to arrive.</p>

	<p>It was the engine that had been separated from the train. The engineer was not dead. When he woke up, he saw that the engine was far away, and he knew the train must be in trouble. He started the engine again and went backwards to Fort Kearney.</p>

	<p>The travelers were happy to see the engine. They could now continue their journey.</p>

	<p>Aouda ran to the train and asked the conductor, "Are you going to start?"</p>

	<p>"At once, madam."</p>

	<p>"But the prisoners, our unfortunate friends&#151;"</p>

	<p>"I cannot wait," replied the conductor. "We are already three hours behind."</p>

	<p>"And when will another train pass here from San Francisco?"</p>

	<p>"Tomorrow evening, madam."</p>

	<p>"Tomorrow evening! But then it will be too late! We must wait&#151;"</p>

	<p>"It is impossible," the conductor said. "If you wish to go, please get in."</p>

	<p>"I will not go," said Aouda.</p>

	<p>Meanwhile the passengers had boarded the train, including Colonel Proctor. The engineer whistled, the train started, and the train soon disappeared.</p>

	<p>Several hours passed. The weather was horrible, and it was very cold. Fix did not move from his seat. Aouda kept coming outside to look, even though the storm was very bad. She heard and saw nothing.</p>

	<p>Evening came, and the group had not returned. Where could they be? The officer was anxious, but he tried to hide it. Night came and the snow stopped, but it was extremely cold.</p>

	<p>Fix did not move, but did not sleep. The night passed this way. At dawn Phineas Fogg had not returned.</p>

	<p>The officer, who was very worried, did not know what to do.</p>

	<p>Should he send more soldiers? Should he sacrifice more men? He did not wait long, though. Gunshots were heard, and the soldiers rushed out of the fort. Was it a signal?</p>

	<p>It was Mr Fogg! Behind him were Passepartout and the two other travelers.</p>

	<p>They had met and fought the Indians ten miles south of Fort Kearney. Just before they had arrived, Passepartout and his companions had begun to struggle with the Sioux. The Frenchman beat three of them with his fists.</p>

	<p>They were welcomed with joyful cries. Phineas Fogg gave the reward to the soldiers. Passepartout said to himself, "I cost my master dearly!"</p>

	<p>Fix did not say a word. He looked at Mr Fogg, and he did not know what to think. Aouda took her protector's hand. She could not speak.</p>

	<p>Meanwhile, Passepartout was looking for the train. He thought it would be there, ready to start for Omaha.</p>

	<p>"The train! The train!" he cried.</p>

	<p>"Gone," replied Fix.</p>

	<p>"And when does the next train pass here?" said Phineas Fogg.</p>

	<p>"Not till this evening."</p>

	<p>"Ah!" was all the quiet man said.</p>
