	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER NINETEEN</p>

	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">The Child at the Stream</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">"Y</span>ou will love her dearly," repeated Hester Prynne, as she and the minister sat watching little Pearl. "Do you think she is beautiful? She is so natural and calm here in the forest! She is a wonderful child! But, I know she can be difficult."</p>

	<p>"Do you know, Hester," said Arthur Dimmesdale, with a smile, "that this dear child has caused me a great deal of worry? I thought, Hester, that the townspeople would surely see my face in hers, as she looks quite like her father. But she is mostly yours!"</p>

	<p>"No, no! Not mostly!" answered the mother, with a tender smile. "A little longer and you will no longer be afraid. But how strangely beautiful she looks here among nature!"</p>

	<p>It was a feeling that neither one of them had ever before experienced, that they sat and watched Pearl walk slowly to them. They could see each other in the young girl. Pearl represented the love between them, hidden for so long.</p>

	<p>"She must not see anything strange&#151;no passion nor eagerness&#151;in the way you speak to her," whispered Hester. "She becomes quite upset with strong emotions if she does not understand where they are from. But, the child has strong emotions. She loves me, and will love you!"</p>

	<p>"You cannot think," said the minister, "how I fear this meeting with our child. Children do not usually like me; I frighten most young ones."</p>

	<p>By this time, Pearl had almost reached them, but stopped, as she looked silently at Hester and the minister, who still sat together, waiting for her to meet them.</p>

	<p>"Come, dearest child!" said Hester encouragingly, and stretched out both her arms. "Why are you walking so slowly? Here is a friend of mine, who must be your friend, also. You will have twice as much love."</p>

	<p>Pearl, without responding to these sweet words, remained across the stream from Hester and the minister. As young Pearl stared at them both in silence, the minister put his hand to his heart, as he usually did when he was nervous. Pearl then pointed to her mother's chest before pointing to the scarlet letter, sitting nearby.</p>

	<p>"You strange child, why do you not come to me?" exclaimed Hester.</p>

	<p>Pearl still pointed at her mother's chest in silence. The child then became angry, as she had never before seen her mother's chest without the scarlet letter.</p>

	<p>"Hurry, Pearl, or I shall be angry with you!" cried Hester Prynne, who was now quite anxious for the child to come to her. "Come quickly across the stream, naughty child, and run here, or I must come to you!"</p>

	<p>But Pearl did not hear her mother's angry words, and began screaming and crying. She continued to point her finger at her mother's chest.</p>

	<p>"I see why the child is upset," whispered Hester to the minister, turning pale as she spoke. "Children do not like change. Pearl does not see me wearing the scarlet letter!"</p>

	<p>"Please, if you know how to calm the child, please do, if you love me!" responded the minister.</p>

	<p>Hester turned again towards Pearl with an anxious look.</p>

	<p>"Pearl," said she, sadly, "look down at your feet! There is the scarlet letter! Pick up the scarlet letter and bring it to me."</p>

	<p>The child then looked to her feet as she spoke, "Come and take it!" the child said angrily.</p>

	<p>"You naughty child!" observed Hester quietly. "I have much to tell you about her! But, she is right, I must wear this punishment for a bit longer&#151;only a few days longer&#151;until we shall leave this place forever!"</p>

	<p>She then walked across the stream to pick up the scarlet letter and replace it on her chest. As she put the letter on her chest, all the youthful beauty and hope she had was gone. She then put out her hand to Pearl.</p>

	<p>"Do you know your mother now, child?" asked she. "Will you now come across the stream with your own mother, now that she has put the shame back on herself&#151;now that she is sad?"</p>

	<p>"Yes, now I will!" answered the child, jumping across the stream, and holding Hester's arm tightly. "Now you are my mother, indeed! And I am your little Pearl!"</p>

	<p>"The minister is here, he wants to greet you, little Pearl," the mother said to her child. "He loves you, my little Pearl, and loves your mother too. Will you not love him? He wishes to meet you!"</p>

	<p>"Does he love us?" asked Pearl, looking up into her mother's face. "Will he go back with us, hand in hand, we three together, into the town?"</p>

	<p>"Not now, dear child," answered Hester. "But in a few days, he will walk hand in hand with us. We will have a home of our own together. He will teach you many things, and love you dearly. You will love him, will you not?"</p>

	<p>"And will he always keep his hand over his heart?" asked Pearl.</p>

	<p>"Foolish child, what a question is that!" exclaimed her mother. "Come and see him!"</p>

	<p>But, perhaps because of envy or childish behavior, Pearl would not warmly greet the minister. The minister&#151;painfully embarrassed, but hoping that a kiss on her forehead might calm the child, he bent his head down to kiss her. Pearl then ran to the stream of water to wash off the kiss from the mysterious minister.</p>

	<p>Soon after, this interview was over, and they parted with great feelings of hope.</p>
