	<p class="storyTitle">PART THREE&#151;A YOUNG WOMAN AT THORNFIELD</p>

	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER SEVEN</p>

	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">Mr Rochester</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">T</span>he house where I was to work was called Thornfield. It was a large house in the country. After a day's journey, I arrived at the house. Mrs Fairfax, who came out to meet me, was a little old lady. She seemed happy to have someone to talk to. The house was dark and cold, with large rooms full of beautiful, expensive furniture. It was not a very comforting house. But I was excited to live there, working for kind Mrs Fairfax.</p>

	<p>However, I soon discovered Mrs Fairfax was not the house's owner, as I had thought. She was only a servant. Thornfield belonged to a man named Mr Rochester, who was not at home when I arrived. My pupil was a girl named Ad&#232;le, who was seven or eight years old. Mr Rochester had taken Ad&#232;le to live with him, after her mother had died. She was French, and could not speak English. But I had learned French at Lowood, so I could speak to Ad&#232;le. She was a pretty, happy child who liked to play with dolls and toys. I taught her English and other subjects for two hours every day in the library. It was difficult to make her study, because she had never had school lessons before.</p>

	<p>A little time passed, and Mr Rochester still had not come home. One day I decided to ask Mrs Fairfax some questions about him. I was very curious to know what kind of man he was, and Mrs Fairfax was happy to talk.</p>

	<p>"Do people like him?" was my first question.</p>

	<p>"Oh yes. He comes from a rich family that is very respected. They have lived here for many years," she said.</p>

	<p>"But do you like him? What kind of person is he?"</p>

	<p>"Well, I have always liked him. He is a fair and good man to his servants. He's a little strange, though. He has traveled to many countries, and knows a lot of things. I think he is a very strange man," she said.</p>

	<p>"What do you mean, strange?" I asked, interested.</p>

	<p>"It's not easy to describe. I never know when he is serious, or joking with me. He is very mysterious, and his life has been full of adventure and trouble. Although I know him well, I understand him only a little. But he is a good man, and a good master."</p>

	<p>Mrs Fairfax would not tell me anything more about Mr Rochester. Instead, she asked me if I wanted to see the house. We went through many large and beautiful rooms, filled with old paintings and furniture. When we reached the top floor, I saw a small passage with some small black doors on its walls. They were all locked. I wondered what was behind the doors; they seemed to be hiding something. As we turned to walk down the stairs, I heard a strange, frightening laugh coming from behind the wall. "Mrs Fairfax, did you hear that laugh? Who is it?" I said.</p>

	<p>"It is probably a servant named Grace Poole," she said. "She always works in one of those rooms." I heard the laugh again. It did not sound like the laugh of a normal woman&#151;it did not even sound human!</p>

	<p>"Grace!" called Mrs Fairfax. One of the little black doors opened and a woman appeared. She looked too ordinary to be a ghost.</p>

	<p>"Grace, there is too much noise," said Mrs Fairfax. "Remember what you have been told!" Grace said nothing; she only nodded her head and went back into the room.</p>

	<p>In the next few months, I sometimes went up to the top floor, where I could look out of the high windows and be alone with my thoughts. I was happy with my work, but I felt that something was missing from my life. I wanted interesting things to happen, I wanted more adventure! People are not always happy with a quiet life, and women need adventure, even if men do not believe it!</p>

	<p>One day in January I had a free afternoon, and I decided to take a fast walk. I wanted to get some exercise and see more of the area. It was a sunny winter day, and I was enjoying the fresh air and blue sky. I stopped on the road and watched the sun go down in the trees behind the house. Suddenly I heard a horse coming. As I watched, it slipped and fell on the icy ground, and the rider fell off. I ran to try and help the man, who was talking to himself angrily as he tried to stand up.</p>

	<p>"Are you hurt, sir? Can I help you?" I asked.</p>

	<p>"No," he said. Clearly his leg hurt him, and he sat down quickly.</p>

	<p>"If you need help, sir, I can get someone from Thornfield Hall," I said.</p>

	<p>"Thank you, but I don't need anyone. I haven't broken any bones," he replied. He was tall and strong looking. He had a dark face and dark eyes, and was about thirty-five. Although he was strange and angry-looking, somehow I wanted to help him.</p>

	<p>"Sir, I won't leave you alone on this road, until I see that you can get on your horse again," I said.</p>

	<p>When I said this the man looked at me for the first time. He studied my face for a moment.</p>

	<p>"I think you should be at home yourself!" he said. "Do you live near here?"</p>

	<p>"Yes, sir. I live in that house over there," I said.</p>

	<p>"You live at Thornfield Hall?" he asked, surprised. He pointed to the house. It was now evening, and all the lights in the windows were on.</p>

	<p>"Yes, sir," I replied.</p>

	<p>"Let me see&#160;... you aren't a servant at Thornfield. I can tell because of your black dress. You must be&#160;...&#160;" He stopped speaking, but seemed to want to know who I was, so I told him.</p>

	<p>"I am the governess."</p>

	<p>"Ah, the governess! Of course! I had forgotten!" He tried to stand up but his leg was still hurting him badly. "Well, I don't want you to find help, but you could help me yourself, if you like."</p>

	<p>"Of course, sir," I said. And so he leaned his weight on my shoulder and I helped him walk to his horse. In a moment he had jumped on to the horse's back.</p>

	<p>"Thank you. You should go home now, it's getting dark!" he said, as he rode away.</p>

	<p>I walked back to the house, happy with the interesting meeting. In my mind I saw the man's dark, strong face. Even when I arrived back at Thornfield, I did not go into the house immediately. I knew I would only spend the evening quietly with old Mrs Fairfax. Instead I stayed outside, staring up at the moon and the stars, thinking about a different, more exciting life.</p>

	<p>When I went inside, the servants told me that Mr Rochester had arrived, but that he had hurt his leg when his horse slipped on the ice!</p>
