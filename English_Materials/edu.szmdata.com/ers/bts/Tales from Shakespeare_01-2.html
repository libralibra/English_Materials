	<p class="storyTitle">The Taming of the Shrew</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">O</span>nce, in the city of Padua in Italy, there lived a rich gentleman named Baptista. He had two daughters, named Katherina and Bianca Everyone called Katherina "Katherina the Shrew." A shrew is a sour, angry, mean young woman. Katherina was beautiful and very intelligent But she was unkind, unpleasant, and usually angry with everyone. It seemed impossible that she would ever find a husband. However, her younger sister, Bianca, was beautiful, sweet, and gentle. Many men wanted to marry Bianca, but Baptista would not allow it "When Katherina finds a husband, I will allow Bianca to marry. But not before!" he said.</p>

	<p>One day a gentleman named Petruchio came to Padua. He wanted to find a wife. He heard the story of Baptista's two daughters. He decided that Katherina's terrible temper did not scare him. "She is beautiful and rich. I will tame her, as if she was a wild horse. I will marry her, and she will become as sweet and quiet as a mouse!"</p>

	<p>Petruchio was very similar to Katherina. He was intelligent, lively, and independent, just like her. He was not afraid of Katherina; instead, he was excited about taming this difficult woman. His personality was very fun-loving, and he thought that it would be fun to marry Katherina. So Petruchio went to the home of Baptista, to ask his permission.</p>

	<p>"Sir, I have come from the city of Verona. I have heard stories of your gentle, sweet daughter Katherina. (Petruchio was lying, of course.) I would like your permission to spend time with her."</p>

	<p>Baptista wanted Katherina to be married. But he didn't want this nice-looking young man to be mistaken. "Sadly, Katherina is not sweet and kind," he said.</p>

	<p>Just then, Katherina's music teacher ran into the room. "Your daughter hit me over the head with her lute!" he cried angrily. Petruchio thought this was very funny. "She is a brave young lady, isn't she? Now I want to talk to her more than ever!" Then he said to Baptista, "Sir, I am in a big hurry. I cannot come here every day to see your daughter. My father, who is dead, has left me all his land. I must find a wife quickly! Now tell me, if Katherina agrees to marry me, what dowry will you give me with her?" A dowry was usually money or jewels that were given to a man along with a wife.</p>

	<p>Baptista thought that Petruchio was a little strange. But he wanted Katherina to be married. So he said, "I will give you twenty thousand gold coins, and when I die,you will receive half my property." Petruchio agreed to this. Then Baptista went to find Katherina and tell her that someone had asked to marry her.</p>

	<p>While Baptista did this, Petruchio thought about what he would say to Katherina. "I will speak to her sweetly. When she shouts at me, I will tell her she is as sweet as a bird. If she frowns and looks angry, I will say she looks as beautiful as a young rose. If she is silent, I will praise her intelligence. If she tells me to leave her, I will act as happy as if she told me to stay for a week!"</p>

	<p>Now the beautiful Katherina entered the room. "Good morning, Kate! For that is your name, I hear." (Kate is a short name for Katherina.)</p>

	<p>"When people speak to me, they call me Katherina," said Katherina coldly.</p>

	<p>"No, you're lying. You are the prettiest Kate in the country. I have heard stories of your beauty and gentleness. So I have come to ask you to be my wife."</p>

	<p>Katherina, of course, was very unkind, loud, and angry. But Petruchio did not become angry himself. No matter what Katherina said, Petruchio said something nice to her in return. Their strange conversation continued for a while. Then Petruchio heard Baptista coming. "Sweet Katherina, we must stop talking of small things. Your father agreed that you will be my wife. Whether you want to or not, I will marry you."</p>

	<p>Then Baptista came in* Petruchio said, "Your daughter has spoken to me most kindly. She agrees that we will be married next Sunday."</p>

	<p>Katherina was furious, of course. "I did not say that! I would rather see him killed on Sunday!" she shouted. Then she scolded her father for wanting her to marry such a crazy man.</p>

	<p>But Petruchio whispered to Baptista, "Do not pay attention to her angry words. When we were alone, she was very sweet. I'm sure she loves me, and wants to be married."</p>

	<p>Then Petruchio said to Katherina, "Give me your hand, Kate. I will go to Venice to buy you beautiful clothes for our wedding. Baptista, you provide the feast, and invite the guests. I will return on Sunday, sweet Katherina!"</p>

	<p>On the Sunday, many people came to see the wedding. Everyone waited a long time, but Petruchio did not come. Katherina was so angry she cried She hated to think that Petruchio had tricked her. At last, however, he arrived. But he didn't bring clothes and jewels, as he had promised. Also, he was not dressed in fine clothes. He brought a servant and some thin, sick-looking horses. Everyone was shocked, and Katherina was a little frightened. Petruchio looked and acted like a crazy man. No one could persuade him to change his clothing.</p>

	<p>"Katherina is marrying me, not my clothes," said Petruchio. "Let's hurry up and get married!"</p>

	<p>So everyone went into the church. Petruchio acted crazy and drunk the whole time. When the priest asked Petruchio if Katherina would marry him, he shouted, "Yes, she WILL!" The priest was so surprised that he dropped his book. When he bent down to pick it up, Petruchio hit him on the head. The priest fell down.</p>

	<p>The fearless Katherina was very afraid. Who was this man? What would happen to her?</p>

	<p>After they were married, Petruchio asked for wine. He threw some of it in a church man's face. Everyone could only stand and stare at this crazy man.</p>

	<p>However, Petruchio was laughing secretly. His strange behavior was only part of his plan to tame his new wife, Katherina the Shrew.</p>

	<p>Baptista had prepared a very large feast. But after everyone left the church, Petruchio grabbed Katherina and said, "We are leaving now. I am taking my wife home!" Nothing Katherina or Baptista said could make Petruchio change his mind. "She's my wife now, so I can do what I want with her!" he said. He seemed so crazy that no one tried to stop him.</p>

	<p>Petruchio put Katherina on a horse. Then he and his servant got onto horses as well, and they began to travel.</p>

	<p>Katherina's horse was very thin and weak. Whenever it would stop walking, Petruchio would shout at it. Finally, they arrived at Petruchio's house. Petruchio spoke kindly to Katherina, but when they entered the dining room, he would not let her eat or drink. "None of this food is good enough for my Katherina!" he shouted, throwing everything on the floor. Katherina did not know what to say. When she went to bed, tired and hungry, Petruchio criticized the bedroom. "This bed is too hard! These pillows are dirty!" he shouted, waking up all the servants. Nothing could make him stop shouting.</p>

	<p>At last, Katherina was forced to sleep in a chair. But she didn't sleep much. She was often awakened by Petruchio's angry voice. He continued to shout at the servants all night.</p>

	<p>In the morning, Petruchio acted the same way. He still would not let his wife eat. He pretended that the food wasn't good enough for her, and threw it all on the floor. Katherina, who had never spoken kindly to any servant before, was forced to beg them for a little food. "I am sorry, my lady, we cannot," they told her, "our master only wants you to have the best."</p>

	<p>"Did he marry me, so he could starve me to death?" cried Katherina "Even beggars that come to my father's door are given food. Now I, who have never had to ask for anything, have had no food or sleep. It is all because of him. And my husband acts this way because he loves me!"</p>

	<p>Just then Petruchio entered the room. He did not really mean for Katherina to starve, so he brought her a small dish of meat.</p>

	<p>"How is my sweet Kate? See here, I have brought you some meat. I am sure my kindness deserves your thanks."</p>

	<p>When Katherina said nothing, Petruchio said, "What? You will not speak? Oh, well&#151;I suppose you don't want this meat. All this trouble for nothing."</p>

	<p>Although Katherina was incredibly angry, she had no choice but to speak calmly. "Please, keep the food here," she said.</p>

	<p>But this was not enough for Petruchio. "The smallest service is given thanks. You will thank me, before you touch this meat."</p>

	<p>"I thank you, sir. Please sit down," said Katherina, although she did not want to.</p>

	<p>"I hope this food will give you strength, my dear Katherina! Eat quickly!" Petruchio said.</p>

	<p>After Katherina had eaten only a little, Petruchio took the dish away. "Now, my love, we will return to your father's house. But first we must buy you some beautiful clothes." Petruchio was not really going to buy dresses. He only wanted Katherina to think so. Petruchio had arranged for some dressmakers to come to the house. He told them, "I will act very strange and angry when you see me with my wife. But do not worry! I will pay you for your clothes."</p>

	<p>First the hat maker came in. He showed Katherina and Petruchio a little hat he had made. Immediately Petruchio began to shout and throw things. "Is this the hat you promised me? My wife will not wear this!" he yelled. He was about to rip the hat into small pieces, when Katherina stood up. "I will have this hat," she said firmly. "Every gentle woman is wearing such one."</p>

	<p>"When you are gentle, you will have one too. But not till then," said Petruchio.</p>

	<p>A little food and water had made Katherina feel better. She was really angry now. "Sir Petruchio, I am going to speak whether you like it or not. I am not a child; you cannot tell me what to do. Many men, who are much greater than you, have listened to me speak my mind. If you cannot listen to me, you had better close your ears. Because I will say what I like!"</p>

	<p>But Petruchio did not pay attention. He knew that the best way of managing "Katherina the Shrew" was not to argue with her. She liked to argue too much. He just ignored her. "Why, you are right, sweet Katherina," he said. "This cap is too ugly. We will send it away."</p>

	<p>"Love me, or love me not, I don't care," shouted Katherina. "I will have this hat, or none!"</p>

	<p>"You said you wanted to see the dress?" asked Petruchio sweetly. He still pretended to misunderstand her.</p>

	<p>Then the dress maker came in.He showed them a beautiful dress. Of course, Petruchio pretended not to like this as well. He did not want Katherina to have either piece of clothing. "What is this ugly thing?" he cried. "Do you call this a dress?"</p>

	<p>"Sir, you asked me to make it in this way," said the dress maker.</p>

	<p>"I have never seen a more beautiful dress," said Katherina. She really wanted it.</p>

	<p>Petruchio just yelled at everyone to get out. Then he said to Katherina, "Come, my Kate. We will go to your father's house. Even if we are wearing poor clothes, we will go."</p>

	<p>Then Petruchio asked a servant to prepare two horses for him and Katherina. "We will reach Baptista's house by seven o'clock, which is dinner time."</p>

	<p>Now, it was a long journey to Baptista's house. It was already two o'clock in the afternoon. Katherina knew they could not reach the house by seven o'clock. But she was afraid to disagree with Petruchio. He was so loud, and angry, and strange. So she said very quietly, "Sir, I am sorry to say, it is now two o'clock. We cannot reach my father's house before seven o'clock.</p>

	<p>Petruchio meant for Katherina to be extremely quiet, shy, and agreeable to him. In those days, a rich and noble woman was supposed to be this way. By the time they arrived at Baptista's house, Petruchio wanted Katherina to be totally changed. He knew that she was right about the time. But it did not matter.</p>

	<p>"Before we leave this house, it will be whatever time I want it to be," cried Petruchio, as if he were a god of the sun.</p>

	<p>"I will not go today. No matter what I say or do, you disagree with me, and disobey me. When we go, it will be what time I say it is."</p>

	<p>So, for another day, Katherina had to practice a new way of acting. She had to be obedient. Petruchio would not let them leave, until Katherina had totally submitted to him.</p>

	<p>The next morning they began their journey. Petruchio wanted to test his wife's obedience. "Look, Kate. Look how the moon shines in the sky!"</p>

	<p>"But sir, that is the sun," said Katherina shyly.</p>

	<p>Petruchio stopped his horse. "It will be the moon, or the stars, or whatever thing I say it is, before we go a step further!"</p>

	<p>Katherina was no longer Katherina the Shrew. Now she was Katherina, an obedient wife. She said, "Sir, please let us go on. We have come so far. The sun shall be the moon, or the stars, or whatever you say it is. It will be the same for me."</p>

	<p>Petruchio pointed to the sun. "So, that is the moon, then?" he said.</p>

	<p>"Yes, I know. It is the moon," said Katherina patiently.</p>

	<p>"You are lying! That is the sun," said Petruchio.</p>

	<p>"Then it is the sun," said Katherina. "But it is not the sun, if you say it isn't. What you want it to be, it is. It will be the same for Katherina, your wife."</p>

	<p>So Petruchio allowed them to continue their journey. However, he wanted to see if this obedience would last. He decided to test Katherina once again.</p>

	<p>Soon, they passed an old man riding a horse. Petruchio spoke to the old man as if he were a young woman. "Good morning, gentle young girl," he said. The old man looked amazed. "Kate, have you ever seen a more beautiful young girl? Look how red her cheeks are. Why don't you tell her how pretty she is?"</p>

	<p>Now Katherina was completely obedient. She agreed with whatever Petruchio said. "Fair maid," she said to the old man, "you are as pretty as a flower. Where are you going, and where is your home? Your parents must be happy, to have such a pretty daughter."</p>

	<p>The old man stared at the two people. Were they crazy?</p>

	<p>"Why, Kate," said Petruchio, "I hope you are not crazy. You say this is a young girl, but he is an old man."</p>

	<p>"I am sorry, old gentleman!" said Katherina. "The sun was in my eyes, and you looked like a young maid. Now I see you are a wise old man. I hope you will forgive me."</p>

	<p>The old man said, "Fair sir and lady, this strange meeting has amazed me. My name is Vincentio, and I am traveling to Padua. My son, Lucentio, is marrying a fair lady there. She is named Bianca."</p>

	<p>Now that Katherina had married, Baptista had agreed to let Bianca marry, as well. "Sir, you are lucky. Your son is marrying a fine lady," said Petruchio. This made Vincentio very happy.</p>

	<p>The three of them had a pleasant journey to Baptista's house. There were many people there. They were celebrating the wedding of Lucentio and Bianca. When Petruchio and Katherina entered, Baptista welcomed them. Another man named Hortensio was there. He had also just gotten married.</p>

	<p>Lucentio and Hortensio had heard stories about "Katherina the Shrew." They laughed and made jokes about Petruchio's wife. "I'm afraid you got the worst woman!" they said. These men were very pleased with their own wives, who were sweet, quiet, and lady-like.</p>

	<p>Petruchio did not pay attention. "Gentlemen, I will bet that my wife, Katherina, is more obedient than your wives."</p>

	<p>Baptista said, "Now, let's be serious, my son. Katherina is a beautiful young lady, but she is the worst shrew in the world."</p>

	<p>"No, she isn't. I will prove that what I say is true. Lucentio and Hortensio, send servants to find your wives. Tell them to ask your wives to come to you, immediately. I will do the same. The man whose wife comes first, will win one hundred gold coins."</p>

	<p>Lucentio and Hortensio agreed. They were sure that their gentle wives were more obedient than Katherina Each man sent for his wife.</p>

	<p>First, Lucentio's servant returned. "I am sorry, Sir Lucentio. The Lady Bianca says she is busy, and cannot come."</p>

	<p>Lucentio looked amazed. "What do you mean, she is busy?"</p>

	<p>Petruchio laughed. "So, she is busy, and will not come. Is that the answer of a good, obedient wife?"</p>

	<p>Then Hortensio's servant returned. But Hortensio's wife was not with him. "Sir Hortensio, your wife thinks you are playing a trick on her. She says you should come to her."</p>

	<p>Petruchio laughed again. "This is terrible!" Then he spoke to his own servant. "Sir, go to your lady, Katherina. Tell her I command her to come to me."</p>

	<p>The men didn't have any time to discuss whether or not Katherina would obey. In just a minute, Katherina came in. Baptista nearly fell out of his chair with surprise.</p>

	<p>"What is your desire, sir?" Katherina asked her husband.</p>

	<p>"Katherina, where is your sister Bianca, and Hortensio's wife?"</p>

	<p>"They are sitting by the fire," said Katherina.</p>

	<p>"Bring them here!" said Petruchio.</p>

	<p>Katherina said nothing, but obeyed her husband. When she was gone, the men all started talking at once.</p>

	<p>"This is amazing! I wonder what it means?" cried Lucentio.</p>

	<p>"It means peace," said Petruchio, "and love, and a quiet life. All things are in their right place, and everything will be sweet and happy."</p>

	<p>Baptista was very happy to see the change in his daughter. "My son, you have won this contest. I will add another twenty thousand gold coins to Katherina's dowry. She is changed, as if she were another daughter."</p>

	<p>"I will show you all something even better!" said Petruchio.</p>

	<p>When Katherina came in, she had Bianca and Hortensio's wife with her. Petruchio continued, "See, here is she. She brings your disobedient wives with her. Katherina, that hat does not look good on you. Take it off."</p>

	<p>Katherina immediately took off the hat and threw it on the floor. The women, as well as the men, were amazed.</p>

	<p>"What is this?" cried Hortensio's wife. "I will never have a reason to be upset, until I am forced to do such a silly thing!"</p>

	<p>"What kind of duty is this? She is a fool!" asked Bianca. "If Katherina is a fool, then I wish you were a fool, too, fair Bianca. You always want new dresses and hats. And I hate them all! You should be more like your sister!" said Lucentio.</p>

	<p>"Now, Katherina," said Petruchio, "I want you to tell these women how they should act. Tell them that they should obey their husbands."</p>

	<p>Katherina immediately gave a long speech about obeying one's husband. This lady, who used to be a "shrew," now spoke happily about obedience, duty, and responsibility to her husband. It seemed that she had been this way all her life. So Katherina became famous in Padua. She was no longer known as "Katherina the Shrew," but Katherina, the best and sweetest wife in Padua.</p>
