	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER THIRTEEN</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">O</span>ne morning late in the fall, the Dashwoods were having breakfast at Barton Park with the Middletons, Mrs Jennings, Willoughby, and Colonel Brandon, after which they planned to spend the day together picnicking nearby. It was quite late in the season for traveling, but the party was pleased for the adventure. The morning mail was brought in while they were sitting together. Among the rest there was one for Colonel Brandon. He looked at the address on the envelope, and immediately left the room, looking quite disturbed.</p>

	<p>"What is the matter with Brandon?" said Sir John.</p>

	<p>No one else knew.</p>

	<p>"I hope he has not received bad news," said Lady Middleton. "It must be something important for Colonel Brandon to leave my breakfast table so suddenly."</p>

	<p>In about five minutes he returned.</p>

	<p>"No bad news, Colonel, I hope?" said Mrs Jennings, as soon as he entered the room.</p>

	<p>"None at all, madam, thank you. It was only a business letter coming from London."</p>

	<p>"But why did you become so upset when you received the letter? Come now, Colonel, let us hear the truth."</p>

	<p>"Remember what you are saying," Lady Middleton said, scolding her mother for such impoliteness.</p>

	<p>"Well, I know who the letter is from, Colonel. And I hope she is well," Mrs Jennings said to Colonel Brandon with a smile. The Colonel, however, disregarded her comment.</p>

	<p>"I am quite sorry, madam," continued Colonel Brandon, speaking to Lady Middleton, "I must immediately go to London for business."</p>

	<p>"To London!" cried Mrs Jennings. "What can you have to do in town this late in the fall?"</p>

	<p>"I'm sorry, I must leave immediately, I must not wait for even an hour."</p>

	<p>Elinor then heard Willoughby say in a low voice to Marianne:</p>

	<p>"There are some people who cannot bear a party of pleasure. I believe Brandon wrote that letter himself as a way to excuse himself from going on a picnic with us. I'm sure he is simply afraid of catching a cold."</p>

	<p>"I have no doubt of it," replied Marianne.</p>

	<p>Colonel Brandon then apologized once more for leaving so suddenly before exiting the room.</p>

	<p>The party was quite surprised at the Colonel's hurried goodbye. Soon after he left, Mrs Jennings began to speak.</p>

	<p>"I know what his business is," she said confidently.</p>

	<p>"Do you?" said almost everybody.</p>

	<p>"Yes; it is about Miss Williams. I am sure."</p>

	<p>"And who is Miss Williams?" asked Marianne.</p>

	<p>"What! You do not know who Miss Williams is? I am sure you must have heard of her before. She is a relation of the Colonel's&#151;a very near relation. I will not say how near, for fear of shocking the young ladies." Then, in a whisper, she said to Elinor, "She is his natural daughter."</p>

	<p>Sir John then came back into the room after saying goodbye to the Colonel, so the subject of Miss Williams was not spoken of any longer.</p>

	<p>Soon after breakfast ended, the carriages were called to the house for the guests to leave, as they would no longer go on a picnic without Colonel Brandon. Willoughby's carriage arrived first; Marianne had never looked so pleased before in her life as she did stepping into his carriage. The two left immediately, and were not seen for the rest of the day.</p>

	<p>When they returned for dinner, Mrs Jennings turned to Marianne, speaking quietly, "I have found you out. I know where you two spent the morning."</p>

	<p>Marianne looked quite embarrassed.</p>

	<p>"I hope you like Willoughby's aunt's house, Marianne. And I hope that when you two are married, you will decorate the home with more style."</p>

	<p>Marianne turned away in great confusion. Mrs Jennings had discovered, through one of her servants, that Willoughby had taken Marianne to see his aunt's home, where he was staying for his yearly visit to her. Upon his aunt's death, he would receive his aunt's home and fortune. Marianne was quite embarrassed that Mrs Jennings had discovered her secret trip to Willoughby's home, as women of that time would not visit their lover's home unless they were soon to marry. Otherwise, such behavior was quite improper.</p>

	<p>Elinor could hardly believe this to be true, as it seemed very unlikely that Willoughby should propose marriage to Marianne, or that Marianne would agree to enter Mrs Smith's home, whom she had never met.</p>

	<p>Soon after dinner, Elinor spoke to her sister about the matter, and was quite surprised to find that Marianne had, indeed, gone to visit the home with Willoughby. Elinor attempted to explain how improper such a visit was, but Marianne insisted that their visit to Willoughby's home was pleasant, and she saw no disrespect in her visit.</p>

	<p>"I do not believe I have done anything wrong in walking on Mrs Smith's grounds, or in seeing her house. They will one day be Mr Willoughby's, and&#151;"</p>

	<p>"If you marry Willoughby, and the home will be your own one day, Marianne, you would still not be justified in what you have done."</p>

	<p>Marianne then looked quite embarrassed. After some time, Marianne returned to her sister, and said with a smile, "Perhaps, Elinor, it was foolish of me to visit Mrs Smith's home, but Mr Willoughby wanted to show me the place. It is a charming house."</p>

	<p>Marianne then continued to explain the house in detail.</p>
