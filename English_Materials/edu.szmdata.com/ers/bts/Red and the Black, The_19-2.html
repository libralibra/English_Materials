	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER NINETEEN</p>

	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">Thinking Brings Suffering</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">A</span> week after the king's visit, the town was still talking about Julien's place in the honor guard. The people were still very angry at Julien, and at Mrs de R&#x00EA;nal, too. "Why did she do it?" they asked. "Because Julien is so handsome," was the answer.</p>

	<p>After they returned to the countryside, Mrs de R&#x00EA;nal's youngest son, Stanislas, became very ill. Mrs de R&#x00EA;nal blamed herself. This is punishment from God, she thought. Julien tried to calm her, but failed.</p>

	<p>"Go away!" she said one day. "By God, leave this house. God is punishing Stanislas for my crime."</p>

	<p>Julien feared she would confess to Mr de R&#x00EA;nal.</p>

	<p>So this is adultery! He thought. Could it be that the lying priests are right? Those men have many sins, so do they know the truth about sin? Julien tried to think of a plan. I love her, but how can I help her? If I leave her she might tell her husband everything and ruin herself.</p>

	<p>"If you want me to leave, I will," he said. "But if you tell your husband then I cannot return."</p>

	<p>Finally Stanislas' fever broke, but Mrs de R&#x00EA;nal was not happy. "I am going to Hell," she said. "I know it. If only you were Stanislas' father! Then it would not be a sin to love you. I cannot stop loving you, though!"</p>

	<p>Elisa went to Verri&#x00E8;res and met Mr Valenod. Mr Valenod was talking about Julien, whom he hated. Ms Elisa then told him what she knew about Julien. Mr Valenod had tried to marry Mrs de R&#x00EA;nal, but she refused. Now she had taken this poor worker's son as a lover!</p>

	<p>"I'm sure this is the reason he refused to marry me," Elisa said.</p>

	<p>That night Mr de R&#x00EA;nal received a long anonymous letter on blue paper with his newspaper. The letter told him everything that had happened in his house. As he read the letter he looked at Julien many times.</p>
