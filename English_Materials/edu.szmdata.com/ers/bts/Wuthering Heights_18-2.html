	<p class="storyTitle">BOOK FOUR: HOUSE OF HAPPINESS</p>

	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER ONE</p>

	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">Return to Wuthering Heights</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">Y</span>ou will now begin to see why I&#151;William Lockwood, who now lives at Thrushcross Grange&#151;have told my story in these four different parts.</p>

	<p>This has not been an easy story to tell, because I met Cathy, Hareton, and Heathcliff when they were adults. I did not know the first Catherine, Catherine Earnshaw, or the Heathcliff of many years ago. I first came to Yorkshire long after many of the people in this story were dead. I understood Catherine Earnshaw through Ellen Dean's eyes. She knew the first Catherine well, and I could see her in my mind.</p>

	<p>But I did see and meet the daughter of Catherine Earnshaw; I did speak with Heathcliff, you remember. I did sit at the table with Hareton Earnshaw during my visit to Wuthering Heights, the gray house that is always in the story. I met all these unhappy people at Wuthering Heights, which I have called "a house of hatred."</p>

	<p>And how does the story end? Is there more to it?</p>

	<p>Yes, there is&#151;and the end is a happy one. Let me tell you what happened.</p>

	<p>You remember that I came to Yorkshire and met Heathcliff during the winter of 1801. I wanted to live at Thrushcross Grange for at least two years, but before the winter was over, I had to go to London on some very important business. I stayed in London until September of 1802, when a friend asked me to spend some time at a friend's house who lived in the north of England.</p>

	<p>That September, I was traveling to my friend's house when I stopped at an inn. A man was giving my horse some water to drink when a carriage passed by.</p>

	<p>"That carriage is going to Gimmerton," he casually remarked.</p>

	<p>I gave a start. "Gimmerton!" I said. "How far away is that?"</p>

	<p>"About fourteen miles away from here," he said.</p>

	<p>Suddenly I wanted to go back to Thrushcross Grange. I was still renting the house, and I wanted to spend the night there.</p>

	<p>I reached the Grange and knocked at the door. No one came out, so I walked around to the back of the house. A woman I did not know was sitting on the porch.</p>

	<p>"Is Mrs Ellen Dean here?" I asked.</p>

	<p>"No," she answered. "She's living at Wuthering Heights now. I'm the housekeeper here for now."</p>

	<p>"Well, I'm Mr Lockwood&#151;the master. I'm going to stay here the night."</p>

	<p>She looked at me in surprise. "I never knew you were coming here, sir!" she said. "I'll have to get your room ready."</p>

	<p>She went into the house, and I followed her. I knew she would need some time to cook a meal, so I told her I would go out for a walk while I was waiting. I wanted to go to Wuthering Heights and talk to Ellen Dean.</p>

	<p>The moon was in the sky as I walked past the lonely churchyard where Catherine Earnshaw was buried. Suddenly, standing on the road, I saw a little boy crying terribly.</p>

	<p>"What's the matter, boy?" I asked him.</p>

	<p>"I saw that Heathcliff and a lady walking there," he said. "I always see them. I'm afraid to pass them!"</p>

	<p>I looked into the churchyard but I saw nothing. I did not understand what the boy was afraid of, so I told him to hurry home and continued to walk.</p>

	<p>When I reached Wuthering Heights a beautiful moon was shining in the sky. As I opened the gate and walked towards the door, the sweet smell of flowers was in the air.</p>

	<p>All the doors and windows were thrown wide open. As I came near, I heard a man and a woman talking.</p>

	<p>"Con-tra-ry," said a voice, as sweet as a bird's. "That's how you say it. I'm not going to tell you again. Remember it&#151;or I'll pull your hair!" There was a sound of laughter.</p>

	<p>"Con-tra-ry," said the man's voice. "And now kiss me, for remembering so well!"</p>

	<p>I looked into an open window. There was a young man, handsome and well-dressed, sitting at the table with a book. I saw that it was Hareton Earnshaw! And next to him was the beautiful young Catherine, the first Cathy's daughter. She smiled and laughed happily. I saw that Cathy was teaching Hareton to read, and they were both in love with each other. Then I went to the kitchen door.</p>

	<p>Ellen Dean was sitting outside in the moonlight. When she saw me she jumped to her feet. "Mr Lockwood! We haven't seen you for a long time!"</p>

	<p>"How are you, Ellen? I'm surprised to see you here!"</p>

	<p>"Well, sir, Zillah had to leave, and Mr Heathcliff wanted me to come back here after you went to London."</p>

	<p>"I would like to speak to Heathcliff about the rent money for Thrushcross Grange. Is he here?"</p>

	<p>"Oh," Ellen said, "you can talk to me about the money. I make some decisions here now."</p>

	<p>I looked at Ellen in amazement, and suddenly she put a hand over her mouth.</p>

	<p>"Oh dear!" she said. "You don't know about Heathcliff. He is dead."</p>

	<p>"Heathcliff is dead?" I asked her. I remembered the little boy I had met by the churchyard, who said that he had seen Heathcliff and a woman walking in the dark!</p>

	<p>"When did he die?" I asked her.</p>

	<p>"Three months ago," said Ellen. "Come in and I'll tell you about it. Have you had anything to eat, Mr Lockwood?"</p>

	<p>"That's all right, I asked for dinner at Thrushcross Grange," I said.</p>

	<p>Ellen and I had a cup of tea while she told me the story.</p>
