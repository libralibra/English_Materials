	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER SIX</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">E</span>mma was pleased with herself for thinking of Mr Elton as a possible husband for young Harriet Smith. She was sure that Mr Elton was falling in love with Harriet, as Harriet was with Mr Elton. She thought the two would make a perfect couple. Mr Elton remarked that Harriet's manners have improved since she met Emma.</p>

	<p>"Emma, you have made Harriet much more graceful than before. She was beautiful before, but you have made her much more attractive."</p>

	<p>As Harriet entered the room, Emma asked, "Harriet, have you had your picture drawn before?"</p>

	<p>"Oh, no, never," was her reply.</p>

	<p>"What a priceless possession a picture of Harriet would be. I would enjoy drawing her portrait, if Harriet would allow me to."</p>

	<p>"Miss Woodhouse, I would love to see one of your drawings; it would be a delight to watch you draw Harriet's portrait," cried Mr Elton.</p>

	<p>Emma wondered why Mr Elton was so excited about her drawing ability; she thought he should be more delighted about Harriet's portrait. However, both Harriet and Mr Elton were eager to have a portrait drawn. Emma was talented as an artist and musician, although she was not willing to regularly study her artistic interests. She often led people to believe that her artistic abilities were better than in reality.</p>

	<p>While Emma was drawing, Harriet was smiling sweetly; and Mr Elton stood behind Emma, watching every line drawn. This annoyed Miss Woodhouse, so she requested that he read to the both of them while she drew.</p>

	<p>Everyone who saw the drawing was pleased with it, particularly Mr Elton, who defended the portrait from all unfavorable remarks.</p>
