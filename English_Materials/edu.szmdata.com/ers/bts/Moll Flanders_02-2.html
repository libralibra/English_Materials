	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER TWO</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">O</span>ne day, the elder brother came running up the stairs to see me while his sisters were in the garden. He came into the room quickly, looking quite anxious.</p>

	<p>"Oh, Miss Betty," he said, "I want to speak with you!" Then, he pulled me close to him and kissed me several times. I tried to escape, but he held me in his arms, continuing to kiss me. Then, he sat down with me, and said, "Dear Betty, I am in love with you."</p>

	<p>I was delighted to hear such words, but I did not know what to reply, and so I was silent. His sisters soon returned from the garden, and he quickly left the room. I was quite pleased to hear such things from a gentleman, and soon decided that I was in love with the elder brother, as well. Unfortunately, I was honestly in love with him, but he was not truly in love with me, which I later discovered.</p>

	<p>The next time his sisters were out, he came to find me again, and sat down on his sister's bed next to me. He told me again of how he loved me dearly, but could not marry me until he received his fortune, which he would not receive until his father died, as I had no money of my own. He planned to make me happy, though, until that time. I was a poor fool, then, however, as I believed that he would, indeed, marry me after he received his fortune, but he had no such plans. After we had spoken for a short time, he threw me down on the bed and began to remove my clothes. I was no longer an innocent young gentlewoman after that day. As he left the room, he kissed my cheek and placed five guineas in my hand. I was confused as to the reason for giving me the money, but was pleased with my new love.</p>

	<p>After that time, the elder brother often found me when his sisters were out, and would make love to me, and each time he left, he would place four or five guineas in my hand. I was amazed at my new fortune, and was too foolish to realise that it was to ruin me. No one else in the family knew of our love affair. The elder brother and I spoke little to each other when others were present.</p>

	<p>One afternoon, he found me alone, and quickly came into the room and closed the door. He began speaking quite seriously. He promised that he would never cheat me, and swore that he would marry me when he received his fortune. He declared that he would never leave me, as he was deeply in love with me. He then gave me a purse with a hundred guineas inside, explaining that he would give me one hundred guineas every year until we were to be married. I worried that I might have a child, and he promised me that if I were to have a child, he would take care of me until we were married. We continued this way for half a year, although I was never with child.</p>

	<p>One day, nearly half a year after beginning the love affair with the elder brother, the younger brother found me in the garden, and asked to speak with me. He declared that he sincerely loved me, and wanted to marry me. I was confused and anxious. I refused the offer of marriage many times after, as he often came to speak to me about his love for me. He admitted that his mother and father would be disappointed that he was willing to marry a woman with no fortune, but he was not concerned with that. He was in love with me, although I felt nothing for him, as I was truly in love with his elder brother, who I planned to marry.</p>

	<p>His mother and sisters noticed that he was, indeed, in love with me, and became quite upset that he was interested in a woman with no fortune. Their behaviour changed, and they became quite cold to me. I was not surprised at their changed behaviour. I expected that I would soon be with child, and would have to leave the house, but that never happened.</p>

	<p>The younger brother often spoke of his love for me to his mother and his sisters. They became increasingly upset with his new love for me. I was quite worried about what to tell the younger brother. I decided that I must speak with my lover about the matter. The next time we were alone together, my lover noticed that I had been crying.</p>

	<p>I explained to my dear lover that his mother and sisters now acted quite differently in my presence. "I cannot explain why they have changed their opinion of me, who they formerly considered as one of their own children."</p>

	<p>The elder brother smiled, then spoke, "They know nothing of our affair, but they believe my brother, Robin, makes love to you. He speaks of you often, declaring that he loves you and will soon marry you.</p>

	<p>I began to cry, afraid to tell him of his brother's behaviour toward me. Soon after, however, the elder brother asked me again to tell him why I was crying. I then told him of his brother's conversations with me.</p>

	<p>My lover was quite surprised at this news. After a short silence, he told me that I should not accept his younger brother's offer of marriage at the present, but that I should not refuse him immediately. I was quite shocked at his words. I reminded him that I could not accept the offer, as I was nearly married to his elder brother.</p>

	<p>"Well, my dear," he said, "don't worry about that now. If I am not your husband, I'll be as good as a husband to you. I'll soon speak to my brother about this matter, then we'll discuss this again."</p>

	<p>The next time we spoke, the elder brother informed me that he had spoken to his brother.</p>

	<p>"Well, Robin, do you honestly love the girl?" the elder asked his younger brother.</p>

	<p>"I do love her more than any other woman in the world. I will marry that girl, and I believe she will not refuse my offer of marriage."</p>

	<p>I was shocked to hear this news. I could not refuse his offer without being forced to leave the house immediately. The family would be quite surprised as to my reasons for not agreeing to the marriage.</p>

	<p>"I can refuse your brother," I told my lover, "I cannot accept, as I am to be your wife some day."</p>

	<p>"My dear," he said, looking anxious, "I will not receive my fortune for perhaps many years, as my father may live for a long time. I have been thinking about this matter for quite some time, and it upsets me as it does you. Perhaps, you should think of marrying my younger brother. He loves you, and will take care of you. You will live a comfortable life as a gentlewoman."</p>

	<p>I was terrified to hear his words. He was quite calm as he spoke, attempting to persuade me to leave him to be with his own brother!</p>

	<p>"This is impossible. I cannot simply fall in love with your brother. I have regarded you as my husband, and now you ask me to forget you to be with your brother because it is convenient. I would rather be your lover than your brother's wife!"</p>

	<p>He was pleased to hear me declare this, but insisted that I must consider marrying his brother. He explained that if I refused his brother, and continued with him, we would both be ruined, but if I were to marry his brother, I could find happiness and comfort in life. We only had a little time to speak, as his mother and sisters soon returned to the house.</p>

	<p>The next week, we did not have an opportunity to speak, although he noticed that I was quite upset and confused with this terrible situation. The next Sunday, however, we were again alone together in the house. He came to see me, and we argued again about his brother's offer of marriage. We were together for an hour and a half, after which he told me calmly that we could no longer be lovers, as I may soon be his sister.</p>

	<p>I was hurt and lost, as I was deeply in love with the elder brother. I soon became quite ill, disturbed over the loss of my lover. I was kept in bed for nearly five weeks with a terrible fever. The doctors were confused, and concluded that I must be in love. With this news, the family continually asked me whether I was in love or not and with whom; but I denied being in love.</p>

	<p>One evening while the family was having dinner, young Robin declared that my beauty and talents were far more than those of his sisters. His sisters became quite angry, and demanded that I leave the house immediately. I was, however, still ill, lying in bed, as I had been for five weeks.</p>

	<p>"I believe," said one of the sisters, "that if Betty is not in love, then my brother, Robin, certainly is."</p>

	<p>Robin then declared that he was, indeed, in love with Miss Betty, and would soon ask her to marry him. Soon enough, the mother of the house came to speak with me about this matter. She asked that I answer her honestly about any affairs with her younger son, Robin. I told her sincerely that there had never been any affair between Robin and I. I told her that Mr Robin had often joked with me, exclaiming that he was in love with me and wished to marry me, but I had never agreed.</p>

	<p>The old lady was satisfied with my answer, and kissed me before returning to the family. She went downstairs to find her children still quite angry with each other, as young Robin had declared that Miss Betty was more talented and beautiful than his sisters. Their mother came downstairs as they were quarrelling. She told them that she had spoken to me, and explained to them that I had told her there was nothing between Mr Robin and I.</p>

	<p>"Miss Betty's wrong," replied Robin, "I spoke to her many times about my love for her, but she never believed that I was speaking honestly."</p>

	<p>"Well Robin," said his mother, "no one ever knows when you are speaking honestly, so please do tell us now. Are you truly in love with Miss Betty?"</p>

	<p>"Certainly," said Robin confidently, "if Betty said she loved me, I would marry her tomorrow."</p>

	<p>"But, Robin," his mother said, looking anxious, "she has no fortune. How could you marry such a woman?"</p>

	<p>"Unfortunately, she would never agree to my offer of marriage. I have asked her many times, but she has refused me every time."</p>

	<p>"Well, Miss Betty is no fool, and has no money, so that cannot be true. If a wealthy man were to offer her marriage, of course she would accept, having nothing herself, "interrupted his sister.</p>

	<p>"Betty's no fool, but she has refused me, although I do not know why," said Robin.</p>

	<p>"Who must it be, then? Who is Miss Betty in love with? She never leaves the house," said the other sister.</p>

	<p>"You have asked me many questions already, so do not bother me with any more. Ask my brother, perhaps he knows," said Robin, quite annoyed with his sisters.</p>

	<p>The elder brother was shocked to hear this, and believed that his younger brother must have discovered the secret between he and Miss Betty. He was so upset that he immediately came to tell me of the news, thinking that I had, perhaps, told Robin of my love affair with his brother. I told him that I knew nothing of it. I told him that while I was ill, I had many times hoped that I would die, rather than recover. I informed him that after I recovered, I would leave the family, declaring that I would never agree to marry his brother. His sister then entered the room, and our conversation was over.</p>

	<p>A few weeks after this, I recovered, and was quite well, although in complete sadness, which surprised the entire family, except the elder brother. Everyday, I expected that the family would ask me to leave, as the mother and daughters believed that, but they said nothing. We continued this way for another sixteen or seventeen weeks.</p>

	<p>One evening, the old lady said, "Betty, I am afraid that what I said to you about my son has greatly upset you, and that you are upset because you are in love with him. Robin often proclaims his love for you, and declares that he will soon marry you, if you will accept his offer."</p>

	<p>"I did not wish him to ask me to marry him. Although, he has asked me many times, I have always refused. I respect you and your husband too much to agree to such a marriage, as I have no fortune, and would, therefore, ruin him if we were to marry."</p>

	<p>"Is this possible, Miss Betty? If you are speaking the truth, then we have not been fair to you."</p>

	<p>"You must ask your son. He will explain that I do speak the truth."</p>
