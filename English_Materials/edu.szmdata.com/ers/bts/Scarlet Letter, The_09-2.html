	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER NINE</p>

	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">The Mysterious Roger Chillingworth</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">T</span>he reader must remember that Roger Chillingworth was the true husband of Hester Prynne, who had arrived in the town during Hester's public punishment on the marketplace platform, holding a small child in her arms. He decided at that moment not to claim the criminal woman as his wife, but to take another name, and begin a new life. He had a new purpose, however, which was to discover the identity of Hester's mysterious lover, and to cause that man great pain and suffering.</p>

	<p>He then settled in the Puritan town as Roger Chillingworth, claiming that he was a doctor who had recently come from England, and was warmly invited into the town. The townspeople were delighted to have a new doctor, with great knowledge, living among them. He had been living with a group of American Indians for nearly a year before arriving in the town. During that time, he had learned a great deal about the medical use of herbs and plants, which he valued greatly as Nature's cure to many illnesses.</p>

	<p>Soon after settling in the town, he chose Minister Dimmesdale as his religious leader. The townspeople considered the young minister to be nearly a guiltless angel, as he was quite popular in the community as a religious leader. Near the time when old Roger Chillingworth arrived in the town, however, Mr Dimmesdale became quite ill. Most in town believed that the young minister worked too hard at his profession, and had, therefore, become ill. Many declared that young Mr Dimmesdale was dying because the world was too evil for his honest and pure soul.</p>

	<p>When old Roger Chillingworth arrived, many townspeople wondered why such an educated man would leave England for a new town in a mysterious land. People decided that Heaven had sent him to care for their dear Mr Dimmesdale.</p>

	<p>Just after his arrival in town, the old doctor became quite close to the young minister, looking quite worried about his illness. He was anxious to cure his new friend. The town's religious leaders and young women begged the minister to accept the doctor's offer of help. Mr Dimmesdale gently declined.</p>

	<p>"I need no medicine," said he.</p>

	<p>But why did the young minister refuse? He grew more weak and pale as each week passed. Did he wish to die? The religious leaders insisted that the young minister accept the help that God has offered him. The minister listened in silence, and finally promised to speak with the doctor.</p>

	<p>The old doctor soon became the medical advisor and dear friend to the young minister. These two men, one old, one young, began to spend a great deal of time together, as the doctor intended to find the reason for his friend's illness, as well as to discover his friend's true character. They took long walks on the seashore or in the forest. Often, one was the guest in the other's home. The minister was interested in the doctor's thoughts, as he could discuss certain topics that he would never talk about with the other town ministers.</p>

	<p>Time went on, and the two continued to spend a great deal of time together, discussing religion, government, and personal subjects. And yet, the minister never spoke of his terrible, criminal secret, which greatly disappointed the doctor.</p>

	<p>Roger Chillingworth, after some time, quietly requested to the other ministers that he move to Mr Dimmesdale's home, so he could better care for the young minister. The town was quite delighted to hear this, as everyone there worried a great deal for their ill minister. Roger Chillingworth then had chosen one of the loveliest young girls in town to marry the young minister. Still, Arthur Dimmesdale refused to marry. The old doctor was always near the minister, to care for him with gentle concern.</p>

	<p>The townspeople viewed Roger Chillingworth as a caring doctor who God had sent to take care of their dear minister, who suffered greatly. No one in town spoke badly about the mysterious doctor. Although, one gentleman of the town who had come from London many years ago, swore that he had seen the doctor nearly thirty years ago with a different name in London where he was involved with a murder. The other townspeople did not pay attention to this story, however. Many noticed that he had changed considerably since being in town, particularly after moving in with Mr Dimmesdale. At first, he had been calm and patient, but after time, his face became ugly and evil.</p>

	<p>After a great while, many believed that the young minister was being visited by the devil, who called himself Roger Chillingworth. The people hoped that the minister would win over the evil doctor, but when they looked at the sick minister, so pale and thin, they worried that he may lose his battle with the devil.</p>
