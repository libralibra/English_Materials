	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT</p>

	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">Parental Feelings</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">D</span>ecember 25th&#151;Last Christmas I was married, full of happiness and hopes for the future, although with fears, as well. Now I am a wife, with more fears, and less hope and happiness. I am a mother, too. My little Arthur, what an angel! His father does not share the excitement of having a new child, but may, in time, love our child as I do with all my heart.</p>

	<p>At first, Arthur was curious and thought the child was amusing, but would not touch the baby. Now, he is no longer interested in his son, except when he is annoyed that he takes all my attention. He envies the child somewhat, as I no longer have time to care for him, as I did before the child was born.</p>

	<p>One evening, I was in the sitting room, caring for my little one, when Arthur came in and sat next to me, looking at the baby.</p>

	<p>"Helen, I shall soon hate that little thing if you continue to ignore me!"</p>

	<p>I looked up in astonishment; perhaps he was joking, but he was not.</p>

	<p>"You think about nothing but that child. I may be cheerful or sad, but you do not notice. As long as you have that ugly little thing, you do not care for me."</p>

	<p>"It is your own son, Arthur! Now, you hold him, and perhaps you will learn to love him. If you were less selfish, you would love your child dearly."</p>
