	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER FORTY-TWO</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">S</span>oon enough, Mrs Elton announced with disappointment, that her dear relatives, Mr and Mrs Suckling, of such high class and wealth, would not come to Highbury till the autumn. She often spoke of a wonderful vacation spot she and the Sucklings went to, called Box Hill. She then decided that until the Sucklings could come to Highbury, the Highbury high class should experience her delightful Box Hill. She became anxious about choosing a date for the party to go.</p>

	<p>"Knightley," she cried one day, "what are we to do? The summer will be over before we ever get to Box Hill."</p>

	<p>"You should come to my home, then. Come and eat my strawberries," he suggested.</p>

	<p>She was delighted, "I should love to come!"</p>

	<p>Mr Knightley's gardens were famous for their strawberries.</p>

	<p>She continued, "Decide what day, and I will come."</p>

	<p>"First, I must speak to some others about what day to choose."</p>

	<p>"Oh, it is my party, I will bring my friends along. I will invite your guests, it is my party."</p>

	<p>"No," he calmly replied, "there is only one married woman who can invite guests to my home&#151;"</p>

	<p>She interrupted, "Mrs Weston?"</p>

	<p>"No&#151;Mrs Isabella Knightley."</p>

	<p>"You are strange. Well, I shall bring Jane with me," she declared.</p>

	<p>"I shall invite Jane and her aunt myself," he said firmly.</p>

	<p>The day came, and all the guests but one arrived. Frank Churchill was still with his aunt, although his father and Mrs Weston were impatient for his arrival.</p>

	<p>Emma noticed Mrs Elton seated next to Jane Fairfax. Mrs Elton had received news that morning of a family willing to employ Jane Fairfax. She had known the family quite well; they were of the highest class. Mrs Elton suggested several times that afternoon that Jane should take the position with the family. Jane politely declined the offer many times.</p>

	<p>Some time later, Emma walked into the house, and noticed Jane Fairfax coming in quickly, looking worried.</p>

	<p>"I am going home at this moment. Please tell everyone for me," Jane requested, looking upset.</p>

	<p>"But, it is too far to walk alone, indeed it is. I will have my carriage take you home immediately," Emma offered.</p>

	<p>"Thank you, thank you, but I would rather walk. I am not afraid of walking alone! I will soon have to watch over others!" she said angrily. "Please, Miss Woodhouse, let me walk home, and tell the others I left," Jane asked, looking worried.</p>

	<p>Emma could not say another word, she watched her leave, and Jane was grateful.</p>

	<p>Jane had not been gone long when Frank Churchill arrived. He was in a terrible mood, and told Emma that because of the hot weather, he should not have come that day.</p>

	<p>Emma thought to herself: "I am glad I am no longer in love with him. I would not like a man to get so upset over a hot morning. Harriet's sweet temper will not mind it."</p>

	<p>Frank Churchill soon returned calmly, and joined Emma and her father as they were looking over pictures from Switzerland.</p>

	<p>"As soon as my aunt gets well, I shall go abroad," said he. "I shall never be content till I have seen some of these places. I am sick of England, and would leave tomorrow if I could."</p>

	<p>"You are sick of fortune and comfort! Can you not find a way to be content to stay?" Emma asked.</p>

	<p>"I am sick of fortune and comfort! I do not consider myself at all a fortunate person."</p>

	<p>"You are not quite as miserable as when you arrived today. We are going to Box Hill tomorrow, will you join us? It is not Switzerland, but it will be a change, which you are looking for. You will stay and go with us?" Emma asked.</p>

	<p>"No, certainly not. I shall go home in the evening, when the weather cools."</p>

	<p>"But you should come again tomorrow morning, when the weather is cool again."</p>

	<p>"No, if I come, I know I will be in a terrible mood."</p>

	<p>"Then you should not come, stay with the Churchills," Emma suggested.</p>

	<p>"But if I stay with them, I will be more upset to think of you at Box Hill without me."</p>

	<p>"Well," began Emma, "you must decide your mood tomorrow, I will talk about it with you no more."</p>

	<p>The evening soon arrived, and the guests decided to leave, after making arrangements for the trip to Box Hill the following morning. As Frank Churchill was leaving, he turned to Emma:</p>

	<p>"Well, if you wish me to stay in Highbury and go to Box Hill tomorrow, then I will."</p>

	<p>She smiled, and knew he would join them the next day.</p>
