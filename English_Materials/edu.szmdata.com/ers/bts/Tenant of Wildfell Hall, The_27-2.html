	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN</p>

	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">Bad Behaviour</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">O</span>ctober 9th&#151;It was on the night of the 4th that Annabella was singing and playing, with Arthur, as usual, at her side. I noticed that she soon stopped playing, and was smiling quietly, as Arthur was whispering into her ear. I looked at Lord Lowborough, who saw the two, and looked quite anxious at the sight. I quickly walked over to the piano and offered her a piece of music to play, but as I came near the two, I saw her hand in his. Arthur saw me come near, and quickly kissed her hand and walked away.</p>

	<p>I felt ill, and wanted to go to my room, but I could not leave them alone with the other guests. I walked to the fireplace, and sat down in silence.</p>

	<p>"Are you unwell?" Mr Hargrave asked me.</p>

	<p>"No, thank you," I replied, and turned away.</p>

	<p>Later that evening, Arthur came to sit next to me, smiling as he sat.</p>

	<p>"Are you very angry, Helen?" he whispered.</p>

	<p>"This is not a joke, Arthur, unless you think that losing my love forever is a joke," I said as I stood up to leave.</p>

	<p>"No, no, Helen, I was thoughtless, and will never do such things again. Please, don't be angry with me. I drank too much wine this evening, and did not realise how foolish I was being."</p>

	<p>"You often drink too much wine. You worry me, Arthur, with your unhealthy habits. But tonight you knew very well what you were doing."</p>

	<p>"Well, I'm sorry for it," he said quietly.</p>

	<p>"You are sorry that I saw you. If Lord Lowborough had behaved in such a manner, you would be quite upset, would you not?"</p>

	<p>"I would kill him! But, Helen, forgive me this one time, and I will never repeat such behaviour."</p>

	<p>I did forgive him, and we have been good friends ever since. He has not spoken much to Lady Lowborough since the incident, except to greet her politely, as a good host should.</p>

	<p>The next morning, however, Lady Lowborough came to me with a proud smile on her face.</p>

	<p>"Your husband was quite happy last night, Helen."</p>

	<p>"He will never be again," I said angrily.</p>

	<p>"Yes, he looked rather quiet today. You've been crying, Helen. Do you always cry when your husband behaves that way with other women?"</p>

	<p>"He will no longer act that way, I promise you," I told her coldly before walking away.</p>
