	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER SIXTEEN</p>

	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">The Race to the Convent</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">D'</span>Artagnan, the Musketeers and their four servants prepared all night and left Paris at five the next morning. Their horses were from the Duke of Buckingham and were fast and strong; by early evening they had traveled as far as Arras, where they stopped to eat and rest the horses. Just as they came close to the inn, a carriage rode away. D'Artagnan thought that he had seen the carriage before. Just then a man came out of the inn and rode off on his horse.</p>

	<p>When d'Artagnan saw the man he jumped back on his horse and yelled: "You will not escape me now!" Before he could ride away, Athos grasped his arm and asked, "Where are you going now, d'Artagnan?"</p>

	<p>"That was the man of Meung!" d'Artagnan cried, "I saw his face when the wind blew open his cloak. Quickly gentlemen&#151;we must follow him!"</p>

	<p>"My dear d'Artagnan," said Aramis. "You must remember that his horse is fresh and ours are tired from a day of travel. We have no chance of following him."</p>

	<p>Just then the inn owner came running outside. "Mister!" he yelled after the man of Meung, "Mister, you dropped a piece of paper!"</p>

	<p>"Friend," said d'Artagnan, turning quickly to the owner, "I will give you a piece of gold for that paper."</p>

	<p>The host looked at him with large, happy eyes, and then said with a smile: "Of course! Here it is."</p>

	<p>D'Artagnan opened the paper, read the words on it, and suddenly gave a shocked yell. "It is a death order, signed by the Cardinal himself," he said. "Friends, look at this!"</p>

	<p>The Musketeers came close to read the words.</p>

	<blockquote>

	<p class="r">Oct. 13th, 1626</p>

	<p>It is by my permission and for the good of France that the man holding this letter has killed who he has killed.</p>

	<p class="r">RICHELIEU</p>

	</blockquote>

	<p>And then, written at the bottom of the paper, just one word: Armentieres.</p>

	<p>"That must be his destination," said Athos, putting a hand on d'Artagnan's shoulder, "and he is just on some business of the Cardinal's. Come, d'Artagnan, remember our business. Let us eat, and rest, and then ride on to Bethune in a few hours."</p>

	<p>Athos then walked into the inn, followed by Aramis and Porthos. D'Artagnan waited outside for a moment, looking down the road. He then made a decision&#151;one that he would regret for the rest of his life. He turned around and followed his friend into the inn, and let the man of Meung ride on.</p>

	<p>In the middle of the night Constance Bonacieux was awakened in her small room at the convent.</p>

	<p>"Wake up, my child, you must dress at once," said the head of the convent, "Someone has come from Paris to see you."</p>

	<p>Constance's eyes filled with excitement and she sat up quickly. "Is it a young man?" she asked.</p>

	<p>The woman shook her head slowly. "No. A young lady," she answered, "A very lovely lady&#151;the Countess de la Fere."</p>

	<p>The excitement left Constance's face. "I do not know her."</p>

	<p>Constance dressed and was then led into a room where a young woman sat at a table covered with food and wine.</p>

	<p>Milady stood up and raised her hands to Constance. "My dear lady, do you not know why I am here?" she asked softly.</p>

	<p>"How can I know? I know nothing."</p>

	<p>"Perhaps you know my husband, the Musketeer called Athos," said Milady.</p>

	<p>"Yes," said Constance, "I have heard his name from d'Artagnan."</p>

	<p>"I have heard all your news: about how you were captured in the pavilion at the church," said Milady, "and about how the Queen rescued you from prison. I have also been told, by the handsome d'Artagnan, who truly loves you with all his heart&#151;"</p>

	<p>"Did he send you here to say that he will soon come?" Constance asked hopefully.</p>

	<p>Milady shook her head sadly. "No, he cannot," she said, "Both d'Artagnan and my husband are watched day and night by the Cardinal's men. They did not dare to come here and led the Cardinal to you. Because of this, they have sent me here to take you to a safe place."</p>

	<p>"You are here alone?" asked Constance, looking shocked.</p>

	<p>"Yes, my dear lady&#151;and we leave here quickly! Many times, while traveling here, I thought that someone was following my carriage."</p>

	<p>Milady sat down again and looked at Constance's face to see if she believed her. It seemed that Constance believed her; she did not think that a woman could be one of the Cardinal's spies.</p>

	<p>"What must I do?" Constance asked.</p>

	<p>"You must come with me," replied Milady, "My husband has a secret place where we can hide and wait for d'Artagnan."</p>

	<p>"I understand, you are right," cried Constance, "I will go and prepare."</p>

	<p>Suddenly they heard the sound of horses running on the road outside. Milady ran over to the window and looked out into the night.</p>

	<p>"Oh my God!" said Constance, afraid. "Who is that outside?"</p>

	<p>"I may have been followed by the Cardinal's men," said Milady. "Wait there."</p>

	<p>The horses came closer and stopped outside the convent. Milady looked out and saw eight men on horses; she recognized one of them as d'Artagnan!</p>

	<p>"It's the Cardinal's Guards!" she cried, turning to Constance, "Quickly! We must run."</p>

	<p>"Yes&#151;we must go," said Constance, but she was too afraid to move.</p>

	<p>They then heard the horses stop under the window, then came the sound of Milady's carriage, which rode off quickly. Then four gun shots were fired.</p>

	<p>"Your carriage has gone!" cried Constance.</p>

	<p>"We can still escape safely," cried Milady, "We can run across the garden. Hurry! We must go before they come inside!"</p>

	<p>Constance was filled with fear. She walked a few steps and then fell down on her knees. Milady tried to carry her, but was not strong enough.</p>

	<p>"Stand up woman! We must run!" she cried in anger.</p>

	<p>"I can't," Constance said, crying loudly. "I am too afraid. I cannot move. Leave me and escape yourself!"</p>

	<p>"I will not leave you here!" cried Milady.</p>

	<p>She ran over to the table and poured a glass of wine. She then mixed some poison into the glass that she had hidden in her dress. Milady then gave the glass to Constance and said: "Drink this wine quickly! It will give you strength."</p>

	<p>She put the glass up to Constance's lips and made her drink.</p>

	<p>"This is not how I wished to take revenge," thought Milady, "but I now have no other way!"</p>

	<p>She put the glass down on the table and quickly ran out of the room.</p>

	<p>Constance tried to stand up, took a few steps and fell back down into a chair, not able to move.</p>

	<p>There was a loud yell, and a moment later the door to the room flew open. D'Artagnan and the three Musketeers rushed into the room.</p>

	<p>D'Artagnan threw down his sword and pistol and ran over to Constance. Athos, Porthos and Aramis put their swords and pistols back into their belts and stood watching d'Artagnan.</p>

	<p>Constance's face was pale and she looked at d'Artagnan like she was dreaming. "You've come to save me!" she said. "She said you wouldn't."</p>

	<p>"Yes, yes," d'Artagnan said softly. "We have come and all is well now."</p>

	<p>"She said you wouldn't come," repeated Constance weakly.</p>

	<p>"She! Who do you mean?" asked d'Artagnan.</p>

	<p>"Athos' wife. She heard your horses and thought you were the Cardinal's Guards. She just ran away."</p>

	<p>"I still don't understand," said d'Artagnan. "Who is this woman?"</p>

	<p>"The woman whose carriage was outside at the door."</p>

	<p>"What is her name?" cried d'Artagnan.</p>

	<p>"I can't remember&#151;it is strange&#151;my head hurts&#151;oh my God! I cannot see!"</p>

	<p>"Her hands are as cold as ice," cried d'Artagnan. "She is sick&#151;quickly bring me water!"</p>

	<p>Aramis ran over to the table to get some water. He stopped when he saw Athos, who was standing near the table and looking sadly at the glass of wine.</p>

	<p>Athos walked over to Constance. She took a deep breath and opened her eyes.</p>

	<p>"Dear Madam," he said softly, holding up the glass of poisoned wine, "whose glass of wine is this?"</p>

	<p>"It is mine, Mister," replied the young woman.</p>

	<p>"Who poured the wine in this glass?"</p>

	<p>"She did&#151;the Countess de la Fere."</p>

	<p>Athos stared at the wine glass and made a terrible cry. Then he threw it down to the floor and said just one word: "Poison!"</p>

	<p>"D'Artagnan, I cannot see. Where are you?" cried Constance. "Do not leave me d'Artagnan! I am dying!"</p>

	<p>D'Artagnan quickly moved over to her side. Her face was pale and sweat came down her head. Her breath was weak and she could not speak. Suddenly Constance lifted her arms and held d'Artagnan's head in her hands. Her eyes opened and she looked at him for a moment as if her whole soul had passed into his eyes, and gave one last breath.</p>
