	<p class="storyTitle">69. The Holy Spirit</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">T</span>he disciples met with other followers of Jesus. They prayed together and waited for the Holy Spirit to come.</p>

	<p>One day, they heard a rush of wind come through the house where they were sitting. The disciples felt the Holy Spirit entering their bodies. They began to speak in many different languages at the same time.</p>

	<p>Other Jews living in the house came running to see what the noise was about. They were amazed to find the disciples speaking in so many different tongues.</p>

	<p>"What's happened to these men?" they asked.</p>

	<p>Some people thought the disciples had been drinking wine, but Peter told them that that was not true. He told them the Holy Spirit had come to them as Jesus had said it would and as the prophets had predicted. Peter preached to them about Jesus and the wonderful things he had done.</p>

	<p>The people felt badly about what they had done to Jesus. They asked God to forgive them, and three thousand of them were baptized. They went out to set up a new church for all the people who believed in Christ Jesus.</p>
