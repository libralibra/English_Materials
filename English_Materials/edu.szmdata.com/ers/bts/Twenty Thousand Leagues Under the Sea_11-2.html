	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER ELEVEN</p>

	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">All by Electricity</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">T</span>here were instruments hanging on the wall of his room, as well as in the other rooms of the submarine, showing its location and direction. Nearby, were the other instruments: the thermometer, giving the temperature inside the submarine, and a barometer, explaining the pressure within the Nautilus, whether on the surface of the water, or in the depths of the ocean.</p>

	<p>"And these instruments here," he explained, "are used to control the lights, the warmth within the submarine, and are the most important element of the Nautilus. In short, they are used to control electricity."</p>

	<p>"Electricity?" I cried in surprise.</p>

	<p>"Yes, sir. I use the chemicals found in seawater to create the electricity. I depend upon the seawater to produce the electricity, and the electricity gives heat, light, motion, and life to the Nautilus."</p>

	<p>"But not the air you breathe?"</p>

	<p>"Oh! I could easily create the air from separating the chemicals that make up water, but I have no need to, as I often go to the surface of the water, and I have a great deal of air stored, if I am unable to come to the surface quickly."</p>

	<p>"It is incredible, Captain!"</p>

	<p>"We have not finished, Professor Aronnax. You still have not seen the back of the Nautilus."</p>

	<p>At the front of the submarine, I saw the dining room, nearly fifteen feet long, separated from the library, which was also fifteen feet long. Then came the large sitting room, thirty feet long, which was separated from the captain's room, about fifteen feet in length, and mine, almost eight feet long, and last, a room filled with stored air, about twenty-three feet in length. In total, the front of the submarine was nearly one hundred and five feet long. The doors were all tightly shut, if there was ever a leak in one of the rooms.</p>

	<p>I followed the captain to the center of the submarine, where we came to an iron ladder. I asked the captain what was on the second level, and was told there was a small boat there.</p>

	<p>"What? You have a boat?" I exclaimed in surprise.</p>

	<p>"Of course, it's an excellent boat, used for fishing or for pleasure," Captain Nemo replied calmly. "This boat is attached to the top of the submarine, which can easily separate itself from the rest of the Nautilus, allowing the boat to go to the surface, while the submarine remains far below."</p>

	<p>"But how do you get back onboard the submarine?"</p>

	<p>"I do not come back, Professor Aronnax; the submarine comes to me, as there is an electric wire connected to the boat, and I send a message through the wire when I wish for the Nautilus to come to the surface."</p>

	<p>"Really," I said, quite astonished, "nothing could be simpler."</p>

	<p>After passing the stairs leading to the platform, from which we had first entered the submarine, we came to Conseil and Ned's room, nearly six feet long, where they were happily eating their breakfast. Then, a door opened into a kitchen nine feet long. There, I observed that electricity was used for all the cooking and the making of drinking water. Near the kitchen was a bathroom, complete with hot and cold water. Next to the kitchen was a large sleeping room, nearly sixteen feet long, with several beds. I then realized there must be a great number of men aboard the Nautilus. Next was the engine room, which had been created by Captain Nemo himself. This room was over sixty-five feet long, divided into two parts, one for producing electricity, and the other for directing the submarine. I examined the various machines carefully, hoping to fully understand how the submarine worked. The captain then explained in great detail the various machines and each one's purpose. I soon discovered that the maximum speed of the Nautilus was nearly fifty miles an hour. I had several questions to ask, so the captain and I returned to the sitting room to discuss the incredible sea machine in greater detail.</p>
