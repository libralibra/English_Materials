	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER FIFTEEN</p>

	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">Going Back Home</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">A</span>fter the great battle the children were all very happy. They sailed the pirate ship back to land. Peter put on Hook's hat and sat in the captain's seat proudly.</p>

	<p>They sailed for many days towards the Azores Islands. The whole time they traveled they danced and chatted and ate all the food that the pirates had on the ship. Wendy even took the old pirate clothes she found and made new clothes for all the boys. After arriving at the island they all flew back to England together. One Thursday in June, Mrs Darling was sleeping in a chair in the nursery when Wendy, John and Michael flew in through the open window and landed quietly on the floor.</p>

	<p>"I recognize this place," said Michael.</p>

	<p>"Of course you do!" Wendy smiled, "This is your room!"</p>

	<p>"And there is Nana's dog house!" said John excitedly. He ran over and looked inside.</p>

	<p>"Nana's not in there!" he said, "There's a man inside!"</p>

	<p>The children all came over and looked in.</p>

	<p>"It's Father!" said Wendy, surprised.</p>

	<p>"Father? He is not even as big as the pirate that I killed!" said Michael proudly.</p>

	<p>"And there is Mother; she's sitting in her favorite chair!" Wendy cried. "Let's get into our beds so she can find us there!"</p>

	<p>Mrs Darling soon woke up and found them, but she had dreamed of finding them in their beds so many times that she thought that she was still dreaming. She returned to her chair and sat down. The children were all very upset, and tears fell from their eyes.</p>

	<p>"Mother!" Wendy cried.</p>

	<p>"That's Wendy's voice!" said Mrs Darling, still not sure if she was dreaming or awake.</p>

	<p>"Mother!" cried John.</p>

	<p>"That's John's voice!"</p>

	<p>"Mother!" Michael sang out.</p>

	<p>Together, the three children all ran to their mother and she put her arms around them.</p>

	<p>"George!" She cried out, "Come quickly!"</p>

	<p>Their father came out of the dog house and put his arms around the children. Nana heard the happy cries and ran in to join them.</p>

	<p>Peter Pan was outside the window, watching the happy family. He wondered sadly if any of his exciting adventures could be as wonderful as this beautiful family.</p>
