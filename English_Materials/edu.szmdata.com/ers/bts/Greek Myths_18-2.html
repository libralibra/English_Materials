	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">Andromeda and the Sea Monster</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">A</span>s Perseus flew back toward the island of Serapis, he happened to see a very strange sight. A young woman was tied to a large rock out in the sea. Perseus flew close to the rock and saw that the woman was very beautiful and also very afraid. She did not seem to see Perseus and stared out at the sea in front of her with a look of fear in her eyes.</p>

	<p>Perseus flew down and landed on the shore near the rock. There was a large group of men and women watching the young woman and the sea. All of the women were crying, and the men had sad eyes as well.</p>

	<p>Perseus walked up to the man in front of the group and asked angrily, "Why is that young woman tied to that rock? Who has done such a terrible thing?"</p>

	<p>"I tied her there," said the man, "but do not call me a cruel man, for truly I am the saddest father in the world. I am the king of this island, and that young girl, Andromeda, is my only daughter."</p>

	<p>"Why have you tied her out there?" asked Perseus.</p>

	<p>The king answered with dark eyes and a slow, sad voice. "Each month, a terrible sea-monster comes to this island and takes away many of our children. I have learned from a wise old man, one who knows about the monsters of the sea, that the only way to stop this monster is to give him my daughter. So, to protect my people, I have put my daughter out on that rock."</p>

	<p>Just then, large waves began to hit the beach and a large head appeared out of the water. Slowly, the sea monster stood up to its full height of twenty meters and approached the beach. All the people screamed in fear as they saw the monster's large, black eyes and white, sharp teeth. It had a long tail which made great waves every time it hit the water.</p>

	<p>When Perseus heard Andromeda scream, he jumped into the air and flew at the sea-monster with his sword in his hand. The monster tried to hit Perseus down with his large hand, but Perseus flew too quickly and avoided each attack. Then, flying forward as fast as he was able, Perseus pushed his sword into the monsters neck. The sea-monster let out a horrible scream and blood poured out of its mouth. Its great body then fell down, creating a huge wave as it hit the water. The wave rose up out of the ocean, as tall as a building.</p>

	<p>Perseus was fast and smart and knew what was about to happen. Before the great wave reached Andromeda, Perseus had untied her and flew her to safety. The men and women on the shore all clapped their hands together and thanked Perseus for his great deed.</p>

	<p>"Young hero," said the king, "I do not know who you are, but we all thank you for your brave help. You have saved this land and you have saved my daughter from a horrible death! If there is anything in my kingdom that you would like as a reward, you may certainly have it."</p>

	<p>"If I may have anything," began Perseus, "then I would like to take your fair daughter, Andromeda, as my wife."</p>

	<p>"If that would please you, great hero, then I give her to you with the greatest happiness," said the king.</p>

	<p>Perseus then turned to Andromeda and sat down on one knee. "I can not take your daughter unless she, too, agrees. Will you marry me, lovely Andromeda?"</p>

	<p>Andromeda walked over to Perseus and reached out her hand to him. He looked up into her eyes and kissed her hand softly. A great cheer of excitement came from the crowd and, right then and there, Perseus and Andromeda were married.</p>
