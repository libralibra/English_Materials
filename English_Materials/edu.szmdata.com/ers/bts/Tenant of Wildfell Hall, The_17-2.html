	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER SEVENTEEN</p>

	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">Further Warnings</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">T</span>he next day, my uncle, aunt and I went to a dinner party at Mr Wilmot's. He had two ladies staying with him, his niece, Annabella Wilmot, quite a beautiful young girl, and her gentle cousin, Milicent Hargrave, who had become quite fond of me, and I was quite fond of her, as well. Mr Huntingdon was invited to the dinner, as well.</p>

	<p>After the dinner, Mr Huntingdon was soon standing near me. He took me away from the party to speak to me privately.</p>

	<p>"Helen, how do you regard me? Helen&#151;Speak!"</p>

	<p>After a short pause, I began, "Well, how do you regard me?"</p>

	<p>"Sweet angel, I adore you! I&#151;"</p>

	<p>My aunt then interrupted, asking that I follow her back to the party. She looked quite upset at seeing Mr Huntingdon and me together.</p>

	<p>"I have much to say to you when we return home tonight," said my calm, but serious aunt.</p>

	<p>When we returned home, my aunt sat down next to me, looking quite anxious.</p>

	<p>"Helen, do you remember our conversation about marriage before we left for London?"</p>

	<p>"Yes, aunt."</p>

	<p>"Do you remember how I warned you against falling in love with a fool? You must be careful. I have heard terrible things about this young Mr Huntingdon. He is a charming, handsome young man, but that does not make a good husband."</p>

	<p>"He is a much better man than you think him to be. My life will be to keep him from making errors. He always listens attentively now, when I speak seriously to him, and sometimes he says that if he had me always by his side, he should never do any terrible things. I will save him from evil."</p>

	<p>"Oh, Helen, Helen! You do not know the misery in marrying such a man!"</p>

	<p>"I have confidence in him, Aunt. God will help me succeed!"</p>

	<p>My aunt thinks I will soon forget him&#151;perhaps she thinks I have already forgotten him. I never mention his name, but I still wonder if we will meet again.</p>
