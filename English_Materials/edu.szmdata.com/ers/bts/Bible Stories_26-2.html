	<p class="storyTitle">26. Mount Sinai</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">T</span>he people of Israel were finally nearing the Promised Land. They began to settle and make camps for themselves. Eventually, arguments began to break out among the people. No matter how small the disagreement, the people hurried to Moses for help. Moses grew tired of listening to the people day after day.</p>

	<p>One evening, Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, arrived with his wife and sons to visit Moses. He saw all the troubles Moses was having to deal with and suggested that Moses pick leaders from among the people to handle the everyday problems.</p>

	<p>"If a really big problem comes up, then they can call on you," Jethro said.</p>

	<p>Moses liked the idea, so he appointed some helpers. It was a good thing, too, because God would soon call Moses to do some very important work for him.</p>

	<p>The group set up camp below Mount Sinai. This mountain reached so high in the sky that a cloud hung around the top of it. God called to Moses from that mountain with a message to tell the people of Israel.</p>

	<p>"Tell my people that I have brought them out of Egypt because I love them," God said. "I have taken care of them, but now it is time for them to obey me. I will tell them some special rules they will have to follow. If they will obey, they will be my most treasured people on earth."</p>
