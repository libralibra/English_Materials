	<p class="storyTitle">52. Concerning Prayer</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">J</span>esus often went off by himself to pray. One time when he came back where the disciples were staying, they asked him to teach them to pray.</p>

	<p>Jesus told them, "When you pray, say, 'Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name, your kingdom come, your will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us today our daily bread. Forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one, for yours is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever. Amen.'"</p>

	<p>Jesus told his disciples to always say their prayers in private.</p>

	<p>"Don't be like the hypocrites who pray in public so everyone will see them," he said. "Pray to God in secret, and if you are sincere and do not doubt him, he will reward you openly."</p>

	<p>After Jesus taught the disciples how to pray, he wanted them to know that God really listened to them when they prayed. Even if they prayed for something for a long time and nothing happened, they were not to give up.</p>

	<p>"What if you go to your friend after midnight and ask to borrow three loaves of bread?" he said. "What do you think he will say?"</p>

	<p>"You may tell him that you need the bread to feed a friend who has stopped by unexpectedly. But he will probably just tell you to go away and come back tomorrow.</p>

	<p>"If you stay there, knocking on his door, sooner or later he will come out and give you what you need."</p>

	<p>Jesus told the disciples to keep praying to God. "Ask God for what you need, and he will give it to you," he said. "If you keep knocking long enough at his door, eventually he will open it to you."</p>
