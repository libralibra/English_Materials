	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX</p>

	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">A Box at the Italian Opera</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">J</span>ulien was more astonished than happy. He realized how wise the Russian plan was.</p>

	<p>Mathilde looked at the letters. "Tell me this," she said. "I have too much pride, I know. Mrs de Fervaques has stolen you from me. Has she given you what I have given you:</p>

	<p>Julien did not answer. Her eyes were filled with sadness. Julien almost gave up at that point. He wanted to hold her; he wanted to kiss her everywhere. "I have my pride, too," he quietly said. "I may love that woman, but I don't know how she feels. But she was nice to me when another woman hated me."</p>

	<p>"Oh! Good God!" Mathilde cried.</p>

	<p>"What promise can you make me?" he replied. "Your heart will change in a few days."</p>

	<p>She cried, and her dress moved a little. He could see her beautiful shoulders. He almost gave in at that moment, but he knew he would regret it. He stood up and walked away, saying, "Ms de la Mole will allow me to think about this."</p>

	<p>That monster! She thought. He's not moved at all! No, I'm the monster. He is good and wise.</p>

	<p>That night Julien did not go to dinner. He had to go to the opera, though. Mrs de Fervaques had invited him. The music brought him to tears, and Mrs de Fervaques saw them. She wanted to talk to him, so she said, "Have you seen the de la Mole ladies? They're downstairs."</p>

	<p>Julien jumped up and looked down. It wasn't their night for the opera, but Mathilde was there. Her eyes were filled with tears.</p>
