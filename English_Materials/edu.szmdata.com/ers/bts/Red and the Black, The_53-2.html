	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">Properly in Love</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">T</span>his family is very strange, Mrs de Fervaques thought. They all love this young priest. He does have nice eyes, though.</p>

	<p>Julien had trouble speaking to Mrs de Fervaques. Mathilde, upset that Julien was hiding from her, sat near Mrs de Fervaques one day. Julien could see her eyes, and this made him upset at first. Soon he began speaking very well. He talked to Mrs de Fervaques, but he only wanted to impress Mathilde. He succeeded; Mathilde was very upset that night.</p>

	<p>When Julien returned to his room, he saw Prince Korasov's letters. I'm late! He thought. I should have copied the first letter long ago. The next morning he read the other instructions.</p>

	<p>Deliver the letter in person. Wear nice clothes and look very sad. If you see a maid, wipe your eyes and talk to her.</p>

	<p>He did this exactly.</p>

	<p>The next day Julien again looked at Mathilde and spoke well to Mrs de Fervaques. This young priest is special, Mrs de Fervaques thought. I can see it in the letter he wrote to me.</p>
