	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER FOURTEEN</p>

	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">One O'clock in the Morning</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">A</span>t midnight Julien was in the garden. He searched the garden like a spy. If de Croisenois is waiting, he thought, he'll want to catch me before I get to her room.</p>

	<p>The weather was very clear, and the moon was bright. She's mad, he thought. It's one o'clock and her light is still on.</p>

	<p>He waited five more minutes, and he put the ladder up to her window. He climbed up with one hand on his gun. When he reached the window it opened, and Mathilde said, "So you've come, sir. I've watched you for the last hour."</p>

	<p>Julien didn't know what to say, so he tried to kiss her.</p>

	<p>"How dare you!" she said, pushing him away.</p>

	<p>Julien wanted to leave, so he turned around. "What is in your pocket?" Mathilde asked. She was happy to have something to say.</p>

	<p>"I have all kinds of guns and knives."</p>

	<p>"You must lower the ladder," she replied. "Use this rope. I always have rope in my room."</p>

	<p>So this is a woman in love, thought Julien. She shows so much wisdom. I can't be the first man; I must be following de Croisenois. What do I care? This will still be a victory.</p>

	<p>"What have you done with my letters?" she asked.</p>

	<p>"I've copied them and sent them away," he replied.</p>

	<p>"Why were you so careful?"</p>

	<p>Julien told her about all of his fears.</p>

	<p>"So that's why your letters were so cold!" Mathilde sounded angry rather than loving, but Julien did not notice. Mathilde tried to say kind words, but she had trouble. They talked of how they could see each other again.</p>

	<p>He's already thinking about next time, Mathilde thought. He thinks he's my master! I have made a mistake, but I must continue. I told myself if he was brave enough to use the ladder, I would give myself to him.</p>

	<p>She gave herself to him that night, but her pleasure was not real. It was a duty to finish. Through it all she controlled what she said.</p>

	<p>When it was over Julien felt strange, but not happy. How different it was from his last twenty-four hours in Verri&#x00E8;res! The Parisian manners could ruin anything.</p>

	<p>The next morning he took his horse to a forest far from Paris. He was more amazed than happy. He felt like a soldier who had suddenly been made a general.</p>

	<p>Could I have made a mistake? thought Mathilde. Maybe I'm not in love with him after all.</p>
