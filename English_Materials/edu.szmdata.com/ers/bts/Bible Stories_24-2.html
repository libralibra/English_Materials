	<p class="storyTitle">24. Journey to the Red Sea</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">M</span>oses and Aaron led the people of Israel according to God's chosen path. They traveled many miles in the desert before they set up camp beside the sea.</p>

	<p>Back in Egypt, the king wanted to go back to building the great structures he had planned. But without all the Israelite slaves, there was no one to do the work. He began to regret letting the Israelite people go. So he ordered some of his army to go into the desert and bring back the Israelites.</p>

	<p>God warned Moses that Pharaoh was sending his men after the Israelites. "Don't be afraid," God said to him. "I am with you, and I will keep my people safe."</p>

	<p>The Israelites were sitting around their tents where they had camped by the sea. They saw a dust cloud on the horizon, and soon realized that the Egyptians were on their trail.</p>

	<p>"Why did you bring us here?" they shouted to Moses.</p>

	<p>"Now they will kill us all."</p>

	<p>Moses broke away from the crowd so he could pray to God.</p>

	<p>"Why are you calling to me?" God said. "Speak to the people and tell them to follow you. But first, lift up your rod and wave it over the sea. You will escape that way."</p>

	<p>When Moses raised the rod over the water, a very strange thing began to happen. The waves parted down the middle of the sea and soon a dry path lay at the bottom. Moses motioned for the Israelite people to follow him.</p>

	<p>The Egyptians could see what was happening. They tried to speed up to catch the Israelites. God was against the Egyptians, though. He showed them his power by causing the wheels to fall off their chariots so they had to drag them along by hand.</p>

	<p>After all the Israelites had crossed the sea, God told Moses to raise the rod again and wave it over the sea. Moses did as God asked and the waters of the sea began to cover the path. All the Egyptian soldiers were drowned instantly.</p>

	<p>The Israelites rejoiced because the Lord had saved them.</p>
