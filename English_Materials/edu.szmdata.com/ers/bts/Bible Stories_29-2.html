	<p class="storyTitle">29. The Golden Calf</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">M</span>oses had patiently written down everything God had told him. Now it was time for him to take the two stone tablets and return to camp.</p>

	<p>He believed the people would be eager to hear about all the wonderful things God had told him. Moses had been gone a long time, though. The people had become very restless. One day they had complained to Aaron about having to stay in one place for so long.</p>

	<p>"We have not seen Moses for weeks," they said. "Make us a god who can finish leading us on this journey."</p>

	<p>Aaron told them to bring their wives' and daughters' golden earrings to him. He melted them down and molded a golden calf. Then he built an altar in front of it. The next morning the people brought offerings to their new god. They brought out food and drink, and Aaron proclaimed it a feast to the Lord.</p>

	<p>God could see and hear everything that was happening. He became very angry and told Moses he would destroy the people for breaking his commandment. Moses begged him to forgive the people of Israel. Then he went down the mountain to find out what was going on.</p>

	<p>When Moses saw the people drunk and dancing before the golden statue, he threw down the two tablets God had given him, and they broke into pieces. He ordered them to grind up the idol, and he made them swallow the dust.</p>
