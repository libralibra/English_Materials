	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">F</span>or the next two or three days, Mrs Jennings wondered a great deal about Colonel Brandon's mysterious reason for leaving so suddenly.</p>

	<p>"Perhaps it was about Miss Williams. She is always so sick. Or, perhaps the Colonel's sister is ill, and has requested that he go see her. Maybe he had to return home for troubling money matters. But, Colonel Brandon has an income of two thousand pounds a year, so it cannot be money concerns. I wonder what it can be! Well, I hope his troubles are soon over so he can return to us quickly, perhaps with a good wife, as well."</p>

	<p>Though Elinor felt quite interested in the well-being of Colonel Brandon, her interest did not compare to that of Mrs Jennings, who was constantly thinking of new reasons for the Colonel's mysterious leaving. Elinor thought more often of her sister's new connection to Willoughby. Marianne had not announced an engagement to Willoughby, and Elinor knew she could not simply ask her sister if the two were, indeed, engaged, as she believed Marianne would tell her nothing. As this silence continued, Willoughby and Marianne looked more in love with each day, but there was no news of a marriage.</p>

	<p>Elinor knew that a marriage between the two was not immediately possible, as Willoughby's income from his land was only six or seven hundred pounds per year, although he received a great deal more from his aunt. His aunt would surely not easily approve of a marriage between Willoughby and Marianne, as she had so little wealth for herself.</p>
