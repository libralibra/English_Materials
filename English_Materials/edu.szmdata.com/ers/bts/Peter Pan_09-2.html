	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER NINE</p>

	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">Trapped in the Lake</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">T</span>he lost boys could not find Peter or Wendy. But they found a small boat and rowed it back towards their secret home.</p>

	<p>"Peter! Wendy!" they shouted as they rowed through the lake, but they only heard the voices of the mermaids. After their little boat left the lake, everything became silent. Then a weak cry came out.</p>

	<p>"Help! Help us!" it said.</p>

	<p>It was the voice of Peter and Wendy! They were sitting on top of Death Rock. Wendy was too weak to stand up and was lying on Peter's arm. Using the last of his strength, Peter pulled Wendy up onto the top of the rock and then lay down to recover his strength. The water was coming higher and higher and Peter knew that they would soon drown. Peter felt helpless for the first time in his life.</p>

	<p>"The rock is becoming smaller," He said to Wendy, "Soon the water will cover the rock."</p>

	<p>"We must go quickly," she said. She did not fully understand the terrible situation. "Should we fly or swim home?"</p>

	<p>"Wendy, can you fly or swim to the island without my help?"</p>

	<p>Wendy told him that she was too tired. Peter cried loudly.</p>

	<p>"What's wrong, Peter?" she asked, becoming very worried.</p>

	<p>"Hook hurt me and I can't fly or swim. I can not help you." Peter cried.</p>

	<p>"Do you mean that we are both going to die?"</p>

	<p>"Look how fast the water is rising!"</p>

	<p>They both covered their eyes with their hands; they did not want to see the water rising. Then Wendy felt something touch her leg. She looked and saw that is was Michael's kite. It must have been blown out of his hand and flew away. Peter grasped the kite and had an idea.</p>

	<p>"Could this kite carry you home, Wendy?" he asked.</p>

	<p>"I don't think I can," she answered, "it's only a kite."</p>

	<p>"But here in Neverland the winds are strong and the kites have magic power!"</p>

	<p>"Can it carry both of us?" she asked.</p>

	<p>"It can't lift two people," he answered, "Tootles and Curly tried it before."</p>

	<p>"Then you go Peter, the boys need you to led them and protect them!"</p>

	<p>"Never!" he said, "You are a lady. You must go!"</p>

	<p>Peter tied the kite rope around her. She grasped his arm and refused to leave without him, but Peter would not go.</p>

	<p>"Goodbye, wonderful Wendy, take care of the lost boys for me," he said and he pushed her toward the sky. A few moments later, she disappeared into the night.</p>

	<p>Peter was now alone on the rock. The water had come so high that there was hardly any space left to stand.</p>

	<p>"To die will be my life's biggest adventure," he thought as he watched the water rise over his feet.</p>

	<p>The water soon covered Peter's legs, and chest and neck. In only a few more minutes, it would cover his head too.</p>

	<p>Just then he saw something moving on the lake. It looked like a big piece of paper. Peter wondered what it was. It was coming closer to him and he saw that it was not a piece of paper, but was the mother bird. The bird was standing on her nest and trying to get the nest over to Peter. She spoke to him slowly and clearly.</p>

	<p>"Get&#151;into&#151;the&#151;nest&#151;and&#151;go&#151;to&#151;the&#151;shore."</p>

	<p>Peter was almost all covered by the water and forgot about being polite to ladies.</p>

	<p>"What are you saying?" he asked rudely.</p>

	<p>The bird repeated what she had said, but Peter still could not understand her. Finally the bird became very angry and shouted, "You dumb head, do what I tell you!"</p>

	<p>"Shut up!" Peter yelled back.</p>

	<p>Even though Peter was rude, the mother bird was still determined to save him. With a strong effort, she pushed the nest against the rock. Then she flew up into the air, leaving the nest empty, so that Peter would understand her meaning.</p>

	<p>Finally, Peter understood her. He grasped the nest and climbed in. He then waved his hand to thank the mother bird as she flew over his head. She was watching him to see what he would do with her two large eggs.</p>

	<p>Peter took off his hat and put the two eggs in it and pushed it towards the shore. The mother bird was happy to see that her eggs were safe.</p>

	<p>Peter then remembered that there was a pirate sword on the rock and he used it to row the nest to the shore.</p>

	<p>Peter reached the underground house about the same time as Wendy. All the lost boys were happy to see that Wendy and Peter were safe. The whole family had a huge pretended meal together to celebrate their victory against Captain Hook and the pirates.</p>
