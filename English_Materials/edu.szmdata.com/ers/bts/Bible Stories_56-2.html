	<p class="storyTitle">56. A Sick Friend</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">J</span>esus had some good friends living in the town of Bethany. They were named Mary, Martha, and Lazarus. He had met Mary when she came to the Pharisees' dinner party uninvited and wiped Jesus' feet with her hair. Jesus had forgiven Mary of her sins, and he often visited with her and her sister, Martha and their brother, Lazarus.</p>

	<p>Mary and Martha sent for Jesus to come quickly one day because Lazarus had become very sick. When Jesus got the message, he said to his disciples, "Lazarus will not die. He is sick for a purpose sent from God."</p>

	<p>So Jesus did not go to Bethany for two more days. He told the disciples that Lazarus had fallen asleep, and they must go wake him now.</p>

	<p>"If he's sleeping, that must mean he will soon be well," the disciples answered.</p>

	<p>"I mean Lazarus is dead," Jesus said. "I'm glad we weren't there when it happened, so you will believe in me when you see what I do. Now let us go to him."</p>

	<p>The disciples didn't understand what Jesus meant when he talked about Lazarus. But still they followed Jesus to Bethany. When they got there, they found out Lazarus was already buried.</p>

	<p>"Lord, if you had only been here, my brother would still be alive," Martha said to Jesus. "But I know that even now if you ask God for anything, he will give it to you."</p>

	<p>Then Jesus said to her, "Your brother will live again." '"Yes, I know he will live again on the resurrection day," she said.</p>

	<p>"I am the resurrection," Jesus said to her. "Anyone who believes in me, even though he might die, will live again. Do you believe in me, Martha?"</p>

	<p>"I believe you are Christ, the Son of God," Martha said.</p>

	<p>Martha left quickly to tell Mary that Jesus had come and wanted to see her. Mary tried to be quiet, so the other Jews who had come to mourn Lazarus would not know what was going on. They heard Mary get up and leave in the night, and thinking she was going to Lazarus' grave, they followed her.</p>

	<p>By the time Mary and the others reached Lazarus' grave, they were crying because they were so sad. Jesus saw how much pain they felt, and he began crying, too.</p>

	<p>The Jews who were with Mary knew of all the miracles Jesus had done. They wondered whether he could have saved Lazarus if he had gotten there before Lazarus died. While they stood around, Jesus told some of them to move the stone lying in front of Lazarus' grave. When they did, Jesus looked up to the sky and said a prayer.</p>

	<p>"Thank you for hearing me, Father," he said. "Now may the people hear me and know you have sent me."</p>

	<p>Then Jesus surprised everyone by calling out to Lazarus.</p>

	<p>"Come out, Lazarus," he yelled. And Lazarus came out, still wrapped in the clothing they had buried him in.</p>

	<p>The people were amazed by such a great miracle. Many began to believe Jesus really was the Son of God. Others were frightened by what they saw. They ran to the Pharisees to tell them that they had seen Jesus bring a dead man back to life.</p>
