	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER THREE</p>

	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">The Laurence Boy</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">"J</span>o! Jo! Where are you?" cried Meg, at the bottom of the stairs.</p>

	<p>"Here!" answered her sister from above. Meg found her eating apples and crying over the latest novel she was reading.</p>

	<p>"Such fun! You and I have received an invitation from Mrs Gardiner for a dance she's having tomorrow night to celebrate New Year's Eve! Oh, now what shall we wear?" cried Meg.</p>

	<p>"Your dress looks new, but I forgot the burn and tear in mine. What shall I do? The burn shows badly."</p>

	<p>"You must sit Still to make sure no one sees the back of your dress," instructed Meg.</p>

	<p>As they walked along to the dance the next evening, both felt a bit anxious, as they seldom went to parties. Though this gathering was rather informal, it was an event to them. Upon arriving, Meg immediately went off with a few of the older girls, whispering and laughing as she went. Jo, however, did not care much for girls, and remained away from the crowd, with her back carefully against the wall. No one came to talk to her, and soon she was left alone. She could not walk around and amuse herself, as the burn on her dress would show. When the dancing began, Meg was asked immediately. Jo saw a young man approaching her, and fearing he meant to ask her to dance, she went to hide in a dark room nearby, hoping to enjoy herself quietly. Unfortunately, another shy person had gone there as well, and she soon discovered the "Laurence boy" hiding.</p>

	<p>"I'm sorry, I didn't know anyone was here!" she exclaimed in embarrassment.</p>

	<p>"Please, stay if you'd like," he said with a laugh.</p>

	<p>"I won't disturb you?"</p>

	<p>"Not a bit. I only came here because I don't know many people and felt rather strange at first."</p>

	<p>"So did I."</p>

	<p>"I think I've seen you before, haven't I? You are a neighbor of Grandpa's," said the boy, sitting down near Jo.</p>

	<p>"Yes, we did have such a good time over your nice Christmas present,"</p>

	<p>"Grandpa sent it, Miss March."</p>

	<p>"But you gave him the idea, didn't you, now? And, I am not Miss March, I'm only Jo."</p>

	<p>"I'm not Mr Laurence. I'm only Laurie."</p>

	<p>"Laurie Laurence&#151;what an odd name!"</p>

	<p>"My first name is Theodore, but I don't like it, so I make people call me Laurie instead."</p>

	<p>"I hate my name, too! I wish everyone would say Jo instead of Josephine."</p>

	<p>"Don't you like to dance, Miss Jo?" asked Laurie. "I like to when there aren't too many people. Don't you dance?"</p>

	<p>"Sometimes. I've been abroad for many years, and don't know how the dancing is done here."</p>

	<p>"Abroad! "cried Jo. "Oh, tell me about it! I love to hear people describe their travels."</p>

	<p>Laurie then told her about his days in Switzerland schools and travels around France, Italy and Germany, among other places. The two chatted till they felt like old friends. Jo liked the "Laurence boy" more than ever and took several good looks at him, so she could describe him to the girls, for they had no brothers, and boys were almost unknown to the young girls.</p>

	<p>"I suppose you are going to college soon?" Jo asked, feeling quite a bit more comfortable with the boy now.</p>

	<p>"No, not for a year or two; I won't go before seventeen, anyway."</p>

	<p>"Aren't you fifteen?" asked Jo, looking at the tall boy, whom she had thought to be seventeen already.</p>

	<p>"Sixteen, next month."</p>

	<p>"I wish I was going to college! You don't seem as if you would like going to college."</p>

	<p>"I know I'll hate it! Nothing but studying. And I don't like the boys in this country."</p>

	<p>"That's a splendid song! Why don't you go and dance?" Jo asked, changing the subject.</p>

	<p>"If you will come too," he answered, with a smile.</p>

	<p>"I can't. I told Meg I wouldn't because&#151;"</p>

	<p>"Because what?" asked Laurie curiously.</p>

	<p>"You won't tell?"</p>

	<p>"Never!"</p>

	<p>"Well, I like standing by the fire, and so I sometimes burn my dresses. This one has a terrible burn on the backside, and though it's been nicely mended, the burn still shows, and Meg told me to stay near the wall so no one sees it. You may laugh if you want to. It is funny, I know."</p>

	<p>But Laurie didn't laugh, and spoke very gently.</p>

	<p>"Never mind that. There's a long hall out there where we can dance, and no one will see us. Please come."</p>

	<p>Jo thanked him and gladly went. The hall was empty, and both were delighted with the other's dancing. When the music stopped, they sat down on the stairs to rest when Jo heard Meg calling for her. Jo found her in one of the side rooms sitting on the sofa, holding her foot.</p>

	<p>"I've hurt my foot dancing. It aches terribly, and I can hardly stand. I don't know how I'm ever going to get home," she said, looking pale with pain.</p>

	<p>"I knew you'd hurt your feet with those silly shoes. I'm sorry, but I don't know what else we can do besides rent a carriage or stay here all night," answered Jo.</p>

	<p>"I can't stay here, for the house is full. Sallie has some girls staying with her, and renting a carriage would be quite expensive. I'll rest till Hannah comes, and then I'll try to walk."</p>

	<p>"I'll ask Laurie; he will go," said Jo.</p>

	<p>"Dear no! Don't ask or tell anyone. Now, watch for Hannah and tell me the minute she comes."</p>

	<p>"The other guests are going to dinner now. I'll stay with you; I'd rather."</p>

	<p>"No, dear, bring me some coffee. I'm awfully tired."</p>

	<p>So Meg waited on the sofa, and Jo went to the dining room.</p>

	<p>"Can I help you?" said a friendly voice. And there was Laurie, with a full cup of coffee in his hand.</p>

	<p>"I was trying to get something for Meg, who is very tired."</p>

	<p>"I was looking for someone to give this to. May I take it to your sister?"</p>

	<p>"Oh, thank you! I'll show you where she is."</p>

	<p>As if used to waiting on ladies, Laurie brought up a little table, and soon went for another cup of coffee for Jo, and was so polite that Meg soon declared him to be a "nice boy." They had a wonderful time drinking coffee and eating candies before Hannah arrived to take them home. Meg forgot her foot, and began to stand up, but fell to the floor with a cry of pain.</p>

	<p>"Don't say anything," she whispered to her sister. "It's nothing. I turned my foot a little, that's all," she explained to Hannah, as she went upstairs to fetch her things.</p>

	<p>While Meg was upstairs crying in pain, Jo decided she must help, and ran downstairs to find Laurie. She explained her situation, and Laurie immediately offered his grandfather's carriage. Jo gratefully accepted the offer, and returned to her sister to deliver the news.</p>

	<p>"I had a wonderful time. Did you?" asked Jo after their return home.</p>

	<p>"Yes, till I hurt myself. Sallie's friend, Annie Moffat, was quite fond of me, and asked me to come and spend a week with her when Sallie does. She is going in the spring, and it will be splendid if Mother lets me go," answered Meg cheerfully.</p>

	<p>"I don't believe fine young ladies enjoy themselves a bit more than we do, though we have no carriages of our own or fancy dresses." And I think Jo was quite right.</p>
