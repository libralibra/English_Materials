	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER TWO</p>

	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">A Mayor</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">L</span>uckily for Mr de R&#x00EA;nal's popularity as a mayor, the public square needed a new wall. Mr de R&#x00EA;nal needed three trips to Paris to raise enough money because a powerful minister said he would always oppose a wall for the square in Verri&#x00E8;res. The new wall is now very large, regardless of any ministers.</p>

	<p>The Mayor's plans are final. When an old army surgeon said that the trees were being cut too much, the Mayor replied, "I like shade, and I will have the trees cut for shade. They have no other use, and they don't bring in any money."</p>

	<p>"Bringing in money": this is a very important phrase, for money always solves any argument in Verri&#x00E8;res.</p>

	<p>One morning, Mr de R&#x00EA;nal was walking with his wife. Mrs de R&#x00EA;nal, a beautiful woman of thirty, was watching her three boys. Mr de R&#x00EA;nal was talking angrily about a man from Paris, Mr Appert, who two days ago visited both the prison and the poor house.</p>

	<p>"How can this man harm you?" asked his wife. "You are very honest with the poor."</p>

	<p>Mr de R&#x00EA;nal replied, "He will blame people for something, and the liberals will write in the newspaper about it. I'll never forgive the priest for inviting him."</p>
