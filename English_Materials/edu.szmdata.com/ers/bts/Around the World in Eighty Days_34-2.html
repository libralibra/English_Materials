	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER THIRTY-FOUR</p>

	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">Phineas Fogg at Last Reaches London</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">P</span>hineas Fogg was in prison. He was to be transferred to London the next day.</p>

	<p>Passepartout had tried to beat Fix when he saw his master arrested, but some policemen held him back. Aouda did not understand anything. Passepartout explained that honest and brave Fogg was arrested as a robber, and the young woman cried.</p>

	<p>As for Fix, he had arrested Mr Fogg because it was his duty, whether Mr Fogg were guilty or not.</p>

	<p>Passepartout had a thought. This new misfortune was his fault! If he had told Mr Fogg the truth, his master would have done something. Instead Fix used Mr Fogg's money to follow him around the world. Passepartout cried and cried.</p>

	<p>Mr Fogg was really ruined. This arrest was the end. He arrived at Liverpool at twenty minutes before twelve on the 21st of December. He had till a quarter before nine that evening to reach the Reform Club. That was nine hours and a quarter; the journey from Liverpool to London was six hours.</p>

	<p>If anyone had entered the jail, they would have found Mr Fogg calm. Did he feel angry inside? Did he still believe that he would succeed?</p>

	<p>Mr Fogg put his watch on the table and watched it. The situation was bad. If he was an honest man, he was ruined. If he was a robber, he was caught.</p>

	<p>Did he think about escaping?</p>

	<p>He sat down and opened his journal. He wrote, "21st December, Saturday, Liverpool, 80th Day, 11:40 am," and waited.</p>

	<p>The clock struck one. Mr Fogg noticed that his watch was two hours too fast. Two hours! If he was on a train right now, he could reach London and the Reform Club by a quarter before nine.</p>

	<p>At thirty-three minutes past two he heard a noise, and then the door opened. He saw Passepartout, Aouda, and Fix.</p>

	<p>Fix was out of breath. "Sir," he said, "sir&#151;forgive me&#151;most&#151;unfortunate mistake&#151;robber arrested three days ago&#151;you are free!"</p>

	<p>Phineas Fogg was free! He walked to the detective and looked at him calmly. He made the only quick action he had ever made in his life. He drew back his arms, and punched Fix.</p>

	<p>"Well hit!" cried Passepartout. "That's what I call a good use of English fists!"</p>

	<p>Fix was on the floor, but he didn't say a word. Mr Fogg, Aouda, and Passepartout went to the station. A special train would be ready at three o'clock.</p>

	<p>It was necessary to make the journey in five hours and a half. This would have been easy, but there were delays. When Mr Fogg stepped off the train, all the clocks in London said ten minutes before nine.</p>

	<p>Having made the tour of the world, he was behindhand five minutes. He had lost the wager!</p>
