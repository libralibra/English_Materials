	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER THREE</p>

	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">Phineas Fogg Has a Dangerous Conversation</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">P</span>hineas Fogg shut the door of his house at half past eleven, put his right foot before his left five hundred and seventy-five times, and his left foot before his right five hundred and seventy-six times. At twenty to six, his usual whist partners arrived: Andrew Stewart, an engineer; John Sullivan and Samuel Fallentin, bankers; Thomas Flanagan, a brewer; and Gauthier Ralph, one of the Directors of the Bank of England.</p>

	<p>"Well, Ralph," said Thomas Flanagan, "what about the robbery?"</p>

	<p>"Oh," replied Stuart, "the Bank will lose the money."</p>

	<p>"I disagree," Ralph said. "I think we will catch the robber. Skilled detectives have been sent to America and Europe."</p>

	<p>"But have you got the robber's description?" asked Stuart.</p>

	<p>"In the first place, he is no robber," returned Ralph, positively.</p>

	<p>"What! A fellow who makes off with fifty-five thousand pounds is no robber?"</p>

	<p>"No."</p>

	<p>"<i>The Daily Telegraph</i> newspaper says that he is a gentleman."</p>

	<p>It was Phineas Fogg who said this. The affair they talked about occurred three days ago at the Bank of England. A package of bills worth fifty-five thousand pounds had been taken from the banker's table. The Bank of England is very trusting. There are no guards protecting the bank's riches. It took some time to notice this theft. As soon as the robbery was discovered, detectives left for Liverpool, Glasgow, Havre, Suez, Brindisi, New York, and other ports. A reward of two thousand pounds and five percent of the amount recovered was offered.</p>

	<p>As the newspaper said, the thief may not have been a professional. On the day of the robbery a well-dressed gentleman was seen entering and leaving the room. A description of the man was sent to the detectives.</p>

	<p>"I still say," said Stuart, "that the chances are in favor of the thief."</p>

	<p>"Well, where can he go?" asked Ralph. "No country is safe for him."</p>

	<p>"Oh, I don't know. The world is big enough."</p>

	<p>"It was once," said Phineas Fogg.</p>

	<p>"What do you mean by 'once'? Has the world grown smaller?" Stuart asked.</p>

	<p>"Certainly," replied Ralph. "I agree with Mr Fogg. The world has grown smaller, and that is why the search for this thief will probably succeed."</p>

	<p>Stuart was not convinced. "Just because you can go around the world in three months&#151;"</p>

	<p>"In eighty days," interrupted Phineas Fogg.</p>

	<p>"That is true, gentlemen," added John Sullivan. "Only eighty days. Here is the estimate made by <i>The Daily Telegraph</i>:</p>

	<blockquote class="letter">

	<p>From London to Suez via Mont Cenis and Brindisi, by rail and steamboats</p>

	<p>7 days From Suez to Bombay, by steamer</p>

	<p>13 days From Bombay to Calcutta, by rail</p>

	<p>3 days From Calcutta to Hong Kong, by steamer</p>

	<p>13 days From Hong Kong to Yokohama (Japan), by steamer</p>

	<p>6 days From Yokohama to San Francisco, by steamer</p>

	<p>22 days From San Francisco to New York, by rail</p>

	<p>7 days From New York to London, by steamer and rail</p>

	<p>9 days</p>

	<p>&#151;Total 80 days."</p>

	</blockquote>

	<p>"Yes, in eighty days!" Stuart said. "But that doesn't account for bad weather, winds, accidents, and so on."</p>

	<p>"All included," replied Phineas Fogg.</p>

	<p>"What about Hindus or Indians? They could stop the train and kill the passengers!" replied Stuart.</p>

	<p>"All included," calmly replied Fogg.</p>

	<p>"You are right, theoretically, Mr Fogg, but practically&#151;"</p>

	<p>"Practically also, Mr Stuart."</p>

	<p>"I'd like to see you do it in eighty days."</p>

	<p>"Shall we go?"</p>

	<p>"Good heavens! I would wager four thousand pounds that such a journey is impossible."</p>

	<p>"Quite possible, sir," replied Mr Fogg.</p>

	<p>"Well, make it then!"</p>

	<p>"I will at once, but you will pay for it."</p>

	<p>"Well, Mr Fogg," said Stuart, "it shall be so: I will wager four thousand on it."</p>

	<p>"All right," said Mr Fogg, "I will wager twenty thousand."</p>

	<p>"Twenty thousand pounds!" cried Sullivan. "Twenty thousand pounds, which you would lose by a single accidental delay!"</p>

	<p>"The unforeseen does not exist," quietly replied Phineas Fogg.</p>

	<p>"You are joking."</p>

	<p>"A true Englishman doesn't joke when talking about a wager," replied Phineas Fogg. "I will bet twenty thousand pounds against anyone that I will make the tour of the world in eighty days or less; in nineteen hundred and twenty hours, or a hundred and fifteen thousand two hundred minutes. Do you accept?"</p>

	<p>"We accept," Stuart, Fallentin, Sullivan, Flagan, and Ralph said.</p>

	<p>"Good," said Mr Fogg. "The train leaves for Dover at a quarter before nine. I will take it this very evening. I shall return to this very room on Saturday, the 21st of December, at a quarter before nine p.m."</p>

	<p>A note of the wager was written and signed. His friends were uncomfortable, because they did not like to make such a difficult bet with their friend. At seven o'clock his friends suggested he make his preparations.</p>

	<p>"I am quite ready now," he calmly said. "Let's play cards."</p>
