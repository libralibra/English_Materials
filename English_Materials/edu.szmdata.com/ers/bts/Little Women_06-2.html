	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER SIX</p>

	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">Beth Finds the Palace Beautiful</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">T</span>he big house was declared to be a Palace Beautiful by all, though it took some time for all to go, and little Beth found it particularly difficult to go. After old Mr Laurence's visit, none of the girls felt too afraid of him, except shy Beth. At first, the girls were unwilling to accept favors which they could not return, as Mr Laurence was quite wealthy, and the March girls were not. But, after a while, they found that Mr Laurence was grateful for their attention to his grandson. So they soon forgot their pride.</p>

	<p>Everyone liked Laurie and he privately informed his tutor that "the Marches were splendid girls." With the delightful eagerness of youth, they took the lonely boy into their company. Never having known mother or sisters, he enjoyed their company a great deal.</p>

	<p>What good times they had! Such plays, walks and evenings in the sitting room, and now and then such happy little parties at the great house. Meg could walk into the indoor garden whenever she liked, Jo looked over the new library, and Amy copied pictures and enjoyed the beauty of the place.</p>

	<p>But Beth, though wishing for the grand piano, did not have the courage to go to the Laurences' home. She went once with Jo, but the old gentleman, not being aware of her shy manner, stared at her, and said "Hey!" so loud that he frightened her. She told her mother, and she ran away, declaring she would never go there anymore, not even for the dear piano. Someone had told Mr Laurence of this, and he decided he must mend the matter quickly. During one of his brief visits, he spoke about his love for music. Beth listened carefully, slowly moving closer to him.</p>

	<p>"The boy neglects his music now, and I'm glad of it, for he was getting too fond of it. But the piano suffers now, as there is no one else to use it. Wouldn't some of your girls like to run over and practice on it, ma 'am?"</p>

	<p>Beth took a step forward, still not saying a word.</p>

	<p>"They don't need to see or speak to anyone," he continued, "but run in at any time. I'm usually in my study at the other end of the house, and Laurie is out a great deal, and the servants are never near there after nine o'clock. Well, please tell the young ladies what I say, and if they don't care to come, well, never mind."</p>

	<p>Then, he stood up suddenly, moving toward the door. Here a little hand slipped into his, and Beth looked up at him with a face full of gratitude, as she said&#151;</p>

	<p>"Oh, sir, they do care, very, very much!"</p>

	<p>"Are you the musical girl?" he asked gently.</p>

	<p>"I'm Beth. I love it dearly, and I'll come, if you are quite sure nobody will hear me&#151;and be disturbed," she added, fearing to be rude.</p>

	<p>"No one will be nearby, my dear. The house is empty half the day, so come and play as much as you like."</p>

	<p>"How kind you are, sir!"</p>

	<p>The old gentleman softly stroked her hair, and stooped down to kiss her on the cheek, saying&#151;</p>

	<p>"I had a little girl once, with eyes like these. Good day, madam." And away he went in a great hurry.</p>

	<p>The next day, Beth went to the great house with the piano, and was quite surprised to find some music on the piano. At last, Beth touched the instrument, beginning to play. She stayed till Hannah came to take her home to dinner, but she had no appetite, and could only sit and smile upon everyone.</p>

	<p>After that, the little girl went to the great house nearly every day. She never knew that Mr Laurence often opened his door to hear the old music he liked. She never saw Laurie standing in the hall to keep the servants away. And she never suspected that the music which she found on the piano was put there for her, and when Mr Laurence talked to her about music at home, she only thought how kind he was to tell things that helped her so much.</p>

	<p>"Mother, I'm going to make Mr Laurence a pair of slippers. He is so kind to me, I must thank him, and I don't know any other way. Can I do it?" asked Beth, a few weeks after his visit.</p>

	<p>"Yes, dear. It will please him very much, and be a nice way of thanking him. The girls will help you, and I will pay for the material," replied Mrs March happily.</p>

	<p>Beth worked early and late on the slippers for quite some time, so they were soon finished, and she wrote a short, simple note, and with Laurie's help, got them onto Mr Laurence's desk one morning before he was up.</p>

	<p>Beth waited all day and part of the next before a response came from the old man. The next afternoon, however, when she returned from a walk around the neighborhood, she found a letter and a little piano waiting for her.</p>

	<p>"For me?" cried Beth.</p>

	<p>"Yes, all for you, my precious! Isn't it splendid of him? Don't you think he's the dearest old man in the world? We didn't open the letter, but we are dying to know what he says," cried Jo, hugging her sister.</p>

	<p>"You read it! I can't! Oh, it is too lovely!"</p>

	<p>Miss March:</p>

	<p>Dear Madam&#151;</p>

	<p>7 have had many pairs of slippers in my life, but I never had any that suited me so well as yours. I hope you will allow me to send you something that once belonged to the little granddaughter I once had. I am grateful for your friendship and wish you the best.</p>

	<p>Sincerely,</p>

	<p>James Laurence</p>

	<p>"Oh, Beth, now that's an honor to be proud of, I'm sure! Laurie told me how fond Mr Laurence used to be of the child who died, and how he kept all her little things carefully. He's given you her piano. You'll have to go and thank him," said Jo, jokingly.</p>

	<p>"Yes, I guess I'll go now before I get frightened thinking about it." And to the amazement of the family, Beth walked to the Laurences' door.</p>

	<p>They would have been still more amazed if they had seen what Beth did afterward. She went and knocked at the door of his office, and when he called out, "Come in!" she did go in, right up to Mr Laurence, and held out her hand, saying, "I came to thank you, sir." But she didn't finish, for he looked so friendly that she forgot her speech, and suddenly remembered that he had lost the little girl he loved, she put both arms round his neck and kissed him.</p>

	<p>The old gentleman was astonished, but he liked it! He then set her on his knee as he had done with his granddaughter. Beth no longer feared him from that moment, and sat there talking to him as comfortably as if she had known him all her life. When she went home, he walked with her to her gate, then shook hands gently.</p>
