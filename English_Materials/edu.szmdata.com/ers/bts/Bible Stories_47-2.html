	<p class="storyTitle">47. A Walk on the Water</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">A</span>fter the huge dinner was over, many people crowded around Jesus to thank him for feeding them. Jesus knew the disciples were tired, so he sent them on ahead to the boat. The disciples waited for Jesus to join them down by the Sea of Galilee.</p>

	<p>Jesus stopped to pray on a mountaintop. He thanked God for what had happened that day. Meanwhile, the disciples grew tired of waiting and took off in the boat. A storm came up suddenly, and the wind steered the boat off course. Jesus could see his friends were in trouble. He stepped out into the water, but instead of sinking, he walked across the water to the boat.</p>

	<p>The disciples saw him coming and thought they were seeing a ghost.</p>

	<p>"If that is you, Lord," Peter yelled, "let me come to you."</p>

	<p>Peter walked out of the boat and onto the water as well, but he became very scared and began to sink.</p>

	<p>"Help me, Lord!" he cried.</p>

	<p>Jesus held out his hand to lift Peter up from the water.</p>

	<p>"Where is your faith, Peter?" he said, leading him back to the boat.</p>
