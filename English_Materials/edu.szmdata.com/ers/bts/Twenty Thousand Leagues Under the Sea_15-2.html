	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER FIFTEEN</p>

	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">A Walk on the Bottom of the Sea</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">I</span>n this room, we dressed for our hunting expedition. After discovering that this trip would be underwater, Ned was rather upset about the adventure, as he would have no way to escape during this hunting trip, but still joined us.</p>

	<p>We were then placed in heavy suits made of rubber. The chest area of the suit had another iron covering to protect our lungs from the great pressure at such depths in the ocean. We were nearly five fathoms under the surface of the water. Then, copper and glass helmets were placed on our heads. We were now ready for our expedition, but I soon realized that I was unable to move, as the suit and helmet were covered in a great deal of metal, and I discovered that it was impossible for me to walk. Soon enough, however, I felt someone pushing me through another doorway. I then felt water fill the room, then another door was open and we were soon on the bottom of the sea with the captain and another member of his crew.</p>

	<p>I cannot explain the wonders I saw on that incredible expedition. I was surprised to see that the light of the sun lit up the ocean floor nearly thirty feet below the surface. The ground was flat, and I had no trouble walking in the water. We walked, seeing small sea animals, flowers, rocks, plants, and shells along the way. We saw plants and animals of every color on that expedition, and thirty feet below the surface of the water, the sunlight was still bright. Some time later, however, the ocean floor changed, and we were now walking through a muddy bottom, with long sea plants hanging down from the surface of the water. A short time later, our path began moving downward. Soon enough, the captain pointed to a mass of plants collected together.</p>

	<p>"It is the forest of the Island of Crespo," I thought, and I was right.</p>
