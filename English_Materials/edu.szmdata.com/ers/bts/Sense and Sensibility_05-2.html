	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER FIVE</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">I</span>mmediately after, Mrs Dashwood sent a letter to her kind cousin, accepting his offer. She then proudly announced to her son-in-law and his wife that she was provided with a house, and should be leaving quite soon. They were rather surprised. Mrs John Dashwood said nothing; but her husband politely told the older Mrs Dashwood that he hoped they would not be moving far away. She then informed him they would be going to Devonshire, quite a distance from Norland Park. Edward quickly turned to Mrs Dashwood in surprise and concern.</p>

	<p>"It is only a cottage," she continued, "but I hope to see many of my friends come visit."</p>

	<p>She ended her speech with a very kind offer to Mr and Mrs John Dashwood to visit her there. She then sweetly invited Edward to come visit at any time. She was quite satisfied with herself, as this invitation for Edward to come visit them showed his sister that she was not concerned about the growing love between her oldest daughter and Edward Ferrars.</p>

	<p>Mr John Dashwood told his mother again and again how sorry he was that they were going to be so far from Norland. He had felt a bit guilty for not helping his mother and sisters any more than he had, but his wife did not seem concerned. When she saw them leave, she pitied them, however, as she knew their income would now be considerably less than that of she and her husband's.</p>

	<p>Mrs Dashwood immediately began making preparations to leave Norland Park. She looked forward to her son's promise to her husband that he would provide for she and her daughters with some income. However, she realized after a great deal of time, that he would not keep his promise to his father to provide his sisters and their mother with any income. Instead, he continually complained of the great expense to care for them for the past six months at Norland. In a very few weeks, Sir John Middleton sent a letter explaining that the cottage was now ready for rent. Mrs Dashwood and her daughters then began preparing for their journey. The four women cried many tears before leaving their beloved Norland Park.</p>
