	<p class="storyTitle">11. The Search for a Wife</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">S</span>arah had grown very old. She lived long enough to see Isaac reach manhood before she passed away. Shortly afterwards, Abraham decided it was time for Isaac to take a wife.</p>

	<p>There were many beautiful women in Canaan, but Abraham didn't want Isaac to marry one of them. He wanted to find a woman from his native land who loved and worshipped God as Abraham and Isaac did.</p>

	<p>Abraham sent a servant to find a suitable young woman and bring her back.</p>

	<p>"The woman may not be willing to make such a long journey," said the servant. "Would I then bring Isaac to her?"</p>

	<p>Abraham refused. He knew it was God's plan for Isaac to stay there in the Promised Land and build a great nation.</p>

	<p>"If the woman won't come back with you, I will release you from your promise," Abraham told the servant.</p>

	<p>The servant left the next day. He took ten camels and loaded them with lots of gifts and supplies.</p>

	<p>On the way back to Abraham's homeland, the servant prayed to God and asked for help to find the right woman. By the time he reached the town, he had a plan.</p>

	<p>Many young women were gathered at the well as he entered the town. They offered water to travelers as a gesture of kindness. "If one of these women offers to get water for my camels also, I will know she is God's chosen one."</p>

	<p>About that time, a beautiful young woman walked up to where the servant was kneeling.</p>

	<p>"May I have some water?" asked the servant. The woman offered her water jar to him.</p>

	<p>"Do your camels need water, too?" she said, dipping the jar in the well again. She filled a trough with plenty of water for the animals.</p>

	<p>The servant knew he had found the woman that Isaac would marry. When he asked her name, she told him she was Rebekah and that she was from Nahor's family. The servant rejoiced because Nahor was Abraham's brother. He gave Rebekah some of the gifts he had brought and asked if they could go meet her father. He wanted to ask permission to take Rebekah back to marry Isaac.</p>

	<p>Rebekah's family was happy to greet the servant when they heard he was sent by Abraham. They consented to the request of the servant to take Rebekah back with him right away.</p>

	<p>The family agreed that the marriage would be a good one. They helped her to pack her things. The servant gave the family many gifts he had brought with him on his camels. Then he thanked God for leading him to Rebekah.</p>

	<p>They set off the next morning on the long journey. It was many days before they reached Canaan. As they entered Abraham's fields, they saw a young man walking towards them. That was the first time Isaac and Rebekah had ever seen one another. But they knew from the very beginning that they were meant to be together.</p>

	<p>God blessed the marriage of Isaac and Rebekah as he promised Abraham he would. Isaac loved Rebekah very much and took good care of her. But it was many more years before God fulfilled his promise that Isaac and Rebekah would bear grandchildren for Abraham.</p>
