	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">T</span>he Bates' sitting room was quite peaceful when Mrs Weston and Miss Bates returned with Emma and Harriet. Frank Churchill had been fixing Mrs Bates glasses, while Jane was playing the pianoforte.</p>

	<p>"What!" said Mrs Weston, "Frank, you have not finished fixing Mrs Bates glasses yet? You started fixing them before we left the house."</p>

	<p>"I stopped to help Miss Fairfax in making her instrument stand steadily," he replied, and then continued, "Miss Fairfax, it would give us all pleasure if you would play one of the songs we danced to last night. Although, you looked rather tired the whole evening, but I was so upset when you stopped dancing."</p>

	<p>She played.</p>

	<p>"What happiness this song brings me. I believe we danced to this song at Weymouth." he said.</p>

	<p>She looked up at him for a moment, quite surprised, and played something else. He took some of her music, and turned to Emma to say:</p>

	<p>"This music was sent with the instrument. Whoever sent this knew that Miss Fairfax has no music here. It shows that this person cares deeply for Miss Fairfax."</p>

	<p>Emma wished he would stop discussing the pianoforte. When Emma turned to Jane Fairfax, she saw her smiling, a smile of secret delight. Emma knew Jane Fairfax was delighted with some forbidden pleasure, which she assumed to be Jane's supposed love for Mr Dixon.</p>

	<p>"Jane must understand you are speaking of Mr Dixon, you are embarrassing her," Emma warned Mr Churchill.</p>

	<p>"I hope she understands my meaning, I am not ashamed."</p>

	<p>Shortly afterwards, Miss Bates saw Mr Knightley nearby outside.</p>

	<p>"Mr Knightley, please come in for a visit," Miss Bates called to him.</p>

	<p>"How do you do? How is your niece, the lovely Miss Fairfax? How is she today? Tell me how Miss Fairfax is?" he began.</p>

	<p>"Oh, please do come in," she again requested.</p>

	<p>"Well," said he, "I'll come in for five minutes, perhaps."</p>

	<p>"Mrs Weston and Mr Frank Churchill are here, too!"</p>

	<p>"No, not now, I must go now. I must go immediately, goodbye," and Mr Knightley then left immediately.</p>
