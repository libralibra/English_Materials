	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER TWELVE</p>

	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">A Young Lady's Thoughts</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">F</span>or the first time in Mathilde's life her feelings were stronger than her pride. Fear of doing wrong was important to people like de Croisenois and de Luz, but not to her. Her real fear was that Julien did not like her.</p>

	<p>Those other men had no character. What would Boniface de la Mole say if he saw the revolution in 1789 and saw seventeen of his descendants die at the guillotine without fighting?</p>

	<p>Mathilde, though, had written to a poor man herself. This fact would dishonor her if it was discovered. She did not know Julien's character, and this frightened her greatly. If I make him my lover, what else would he want? She thought.</p>

	<p>The next morning Julien went to the library. As soon as he sat down, Mathilde entered the room. He gave her his letter, and she dashed off. Is she playing a game with Count Norbert? He thought. I cannot let myself feel anything for this doll. I should not have stayed in Paris.</p>

	<p>Julien thought about this mistake until Mathilde returned. She gave him another letter and fled. Julien thought, it's to be love by letter. My enemy has made a mistake.</p>

	<p>The two met in the hall, and Mathilde took Julien's next letter with laughter in her eyes. Poor Mrs de R&#x00EA;nal's eyes always had love, he thought, never laughter like this.</p>

	<p>At five o'clock she gave Julien the next letter. Julien turned pale when he read the short letter.</p>

	<p>I must talk to you tonight. At midnight take the ladder in the garden and come to my room.</p>
