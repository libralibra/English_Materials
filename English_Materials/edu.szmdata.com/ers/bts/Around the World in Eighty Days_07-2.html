	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER SEVEN</p>

	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">Shows That Passports Are Useless to Detectives</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">T</span>he detective quickly went to the consul's office.</p>

	<p>"Consul," said he, "I believe my man is a passenger on the Mongolia." Fix told him about the passport.</p>

	<p>"Well, Mr Fix," replied the consul, "I shall not be sorry to see the thief's face; but perhaps he won't come here. A robber doesn't like to leave evidence behind, and he's not required to have his passport signed."</p>

	<p>"If he is as smart as I think he is, consul, he will come."</p>

	<p>"To have a visa put in his passport?"</p>

	<p>"Yes. Passports are only good for annoying honest folks, and aiding the flight of thieves. But I hope you will not give him a visa."</p>

	<p>"Why not? If the passport is real I have no right to refuse."</p>

	<p>"Still, I must keep this man here until I can get a warrant to arrest him from London."</p>

	<p>"Ah, so that's what you want. But I cannot&#151;"</p>

	<p>The consul did not finish his sentence, because two strangers entered the room.</p>

	<p>One was the servant Fix had met, and the other held out his passport. The consul took the document and carefully read it.</p>

	<p>"You are Mr Phineas Fogg?" said the consul.</p>

	<p>"I am."</p>

	<p>"And this is your servant?"</p>

	<p>"He is: a Frenchman, named Passepartout."</p>

	<p>"You are from London?"</p>

	<p>"Yes."</p>

	<p>"And you are going&#151;"</p>

	<p>"To Bombay."</p>

	<p>"Very good, sir. You know that you do not need a visa, and that no passport is required."</p>

	<p>"I know it, sir," replied Phineas Fogg, "but I wish to prove that I came by Suez."</p>

	<p>"Very well, sir."</p>

	<p>The consulate signed the passport, and Mr Fogg left.</p>

	<p>"Well, he looks and acts like an honest man," replied the consul.</p>

	<p>"Possibly, but don't you think he matches the description of the robber?"</p>

	<p>"Yes, but, you know, all descriptions&#151;"</p>

	<p>"I'll make certain of it," interrupted Fix. "The servant is French, and can't help talking."</p>

	<p>Fix started off in search of Passepartout.</p>

	<p>Mr Fogg returned to the boat and took his notebook, which contained:</p>

	<p>"Left London, Wednesday, October 2nd, at 8.45 p.m.</p>

	<p>"Reached Paris, Thursday, October 3rd, at 7.20 a.m.</p>

	<p>"Left Paris, Thursday, at 8.40 a.m.</p>

	<p>"Reached Turin by Mont Cenis, Friday, October 4th, at 6.35 a.m.</p>

	<p>"Left Turin, Friday, at 7.20 a.m.</p>

	<p>"Arrived at Brindisi, Saturday, October 5th, at 4 p.m.</p>

	<p>"Sailed on the Mongolia, Saturday, at 5 p.m.</p>

	<p>"Reached Suez, Wednesday, October 9th, at 11 a.m.</p>

	<p>"Total of hours spent, 158; or, in days, six days and a half."</p>
