	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER TEN</p>

	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">A Good Heart and a Small Fortune</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">J</span>ulien's anger that day reached even Mr de R&#x00EA;nal. He told Mr de R&#xEA;nal how well the students were learning. How could Mr de R&#xEA;nal say such awful things to him? Then he said, "I know where to go, sir, when I leave your house."</p>

	<p>Mr de R&#x00EA;nal knew what this meant. Mr Valenod had made Julien an offer. "I will give you more money, then."</p>

	<p>Julien's anger disappeared. "This man is an animal", he thought, "That's the best apology his small mind can think of."</p>

	<p>Later he asked Mr de R&#x00EA;nal for the day off so he could visit Father Ch&#x00E9;lan. On his way to Verri&#x00E8;res Julien stopped in the woods. He thought about the day. He had lived through danger and won more money. Two victories in one day!</p>

	<p>He saw a hawk through the trees, and he watched it fly. It was powerful and alone. He wanted to be like the bird. Napoleon was like that. Could Julien become that way?</p>
