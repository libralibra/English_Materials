	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER THIRTY-EIGHT</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">O</span>n the day of the dance, Frank Churchill arrived at the Westons just before dinner. This was the second time he and Emma had met since the Churchills had come to London, then Richmond. Frank was standing by her at the beginning of the dance, but looked uneasy. He often glanced at the door, waiting for others to arrive. Soon, Jane Fairfax and her aunt arrived. Frank immediately went outside to greet them.</p>

	<p>"A very fine young man, indeed, Mr Weston. You should believe me. I never compliment someone if I do not truly believe what I say," Mrs Elton remarked about young Frank Churchill.</p>

	<p>Mrs Bates and Jane Fairfax arrived, escorted in by Mr Weston and his son. As the door opened, only Mrs Bates could be heard, taking several minutes to talk, greeting everyone present with excitement. After Frank Churchill returned, he began talking lively. Finally, Emma had an opportunity to speak with him again.</p>

	<p>"How do you like Mrs Elton?" she asked, in a whisper.</p>

	<p>"Not at all," he replied.</p>

	<p>Emma was content that he shared her low opinion of the woman.</p>

	<p>Frank soon changed the subject, "Where is my father? When are we to begin dancing?" he said before he walked off to find his father. Emma could not understand his strange behavior.</p>

	<p>As the ball began, Frank remembered his promise to Emma. He turned to her instantly to ask for a dance, and she agreed with pleasure. Emma was pleased with the dance until she saw that Harriet had no dancing partner. She was the only lady sitting down. Emma then noticed that Mr Elton was walking around the room alone. Mrs Weston soon joined him.</p>

	<p>"Do you not dance, Mr Elton?" she asked him.</p>

	<p>"If you will dance with me, of course I will," he replied.</p>

	<p>"Me! Oh no! I am no dancer, but I see Miss Smith has no partner."</p>

	<p>"Miss Smith, oh no, no. I am married now; I no longer dance. Please excuse me," he told her before walking off. Emma noticed him look to his wife, smiling, and she smiled back, both delighted for the chance to hurt poor Harriet.</p>

	<p>Mrs Weston said no more. Emma was shocked, and immediately went to sit with her friend. As she walked, however, Emma saw Mr George Knightley leading Harriet to dance. Emma was surprised and pleased, thankful to Mr Knightley for saving Harriet from embarrassment. Emma soon heard Mrs Elton speaking loudly:</p>

	<p>"Knightley has taken pity on poor little Miss Smith! Very good of him."</p>

	<p>After the dancing, Emma went to speak with Mr Knightley, smiling.</p>

	<p>"The Eltons wanted to hurt more than just Harriet, you know, Emma. Why are the Eltons your enemies?" he immediately asked her, with a smile.</p>

	<p>Emma gave no response.</p>

	<p>"Tell me, then. You did want Mr Elton to marry Harriet".</p>

	<p>"I did," replied Emma, "and now the Eltons cannot forgive me. I realize now, however, that Mr Elton is not the good person I thought he was. I was sure he was in love with Harriet."</p>

	<p>"Harriet Smith has wonderful qualities, which Mrs Elton is without. While I danced with Harriet, I realized she is more interesting than I had thought."</p>

	<p>Emma was extremely grateful.</p>
