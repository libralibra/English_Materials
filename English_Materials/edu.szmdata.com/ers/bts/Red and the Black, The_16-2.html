	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER SIXTEEN</p>

	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">The Day After</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">T</span>he next morning Julien acted calmly. He only looked at Mrs de R&#x00EA;nal once. At first Mrs de R&#x00EA;nal thought this was good. Later he didn't look at her again, and she began to worry. "Doesn't he love me?" She wondered.</p>

	<p>She touched his hand when they walked to the garden, and he gave her a loving look. This calmed her fears, but did not end them. She wanted to be alone with him. She wanted him to come to her room again.</p>

	<p>Julien knew his duty, and at one o'clock he went to her room. That day he had greater happiness in love, because he thought less of his role. His happiness made Mrs de R&#x00EA;nal less afraid and even happier.</p>

	<p>In a few days Julien was head over heels in love with Mrs de R&#x00EA;nal. His love still came from ambition, but he had almost forgotten the idea of the role he had to play.</p>

	<p>Mrs de R&#x00EA;nal could not believe this new love's happiness. She never knew such joy existed. She only wished she could have married Julien instead of Mr de R&#x00EA;nal.</p>

	<p>Soon Mrs Derville went home. Mrs de R&#x00EA;nal was sad, but now she and Julien were alone almost all day. This was good for Julien, because when he was alone he thought of Fouqu&#xE9;'s offer.</p>
