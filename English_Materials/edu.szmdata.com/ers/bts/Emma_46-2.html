	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER FORTY-SIX</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">O</span>ne morning, about ten days after Mrs Churchill's death, Mr Weston arrived at the Woodhouse home, looking worried. He asked that Emma immediately go with him to meet Mrs Weston.</p>

	<p>The two quickly left, and walked to see Mrs Weston.</p>

	<p>"Now," said Emma, as they went, "please tell me what has happened."</p>

	<p>"No, no," he replied quickly, "don't ask me. I promised my wife I would not tell you. She will tell you, do not be impatient, Emma."</p>

	<p>Emma realized Mr Weston was determined not to tell her anything. She walked on in silence.</p>

	<p>"Who is that gentleman on horseback?" she asked as they walked.</p>

	<p>"I do not know. Not Frank, it is not Frank, I assure you. You will not see him. He has returned home already."</p>

	<p>"Your son has come to Highbury today, then?"</p>

	<p>"Oh, yes, did you not know? Well, well, never mind."</p>

	<p>For a moment he was silent, and then added:</p>

	<p>"Yes, Frank came over this morning just to ask us how we were."</p>

	<p>They soon arrived. Mrs Weston looked ill. Emma eagerly asked:</p>

	<p>"What is it, my dear friend? Please tell me what has happened."</p>

	<p>"You still do not know?" asked Mrs Weston worriedly. "My dear Emma, cannot you guess?"</p>

	<p>"I know this relates to Mr Frank Churchill, but that is all I know."</p>

	<p>"You are right. He came to speak to his father about a woman this morning," Mrs Weston paused.</p>

	<p>Emma thought first of herself, and then of Harriet.</p>

	<p>"He is engaged, Emma. Frank Churchill and Miss Fairfax are engaged, and have long been engaged."</p>

	<p>Emma jumped with surprise, and exclaimed:</p>

	<p>"Jane Fairfax! You are not serious?"</p>

	<p>"It is so. They have been engaged since October, while the two were in Weymouth, and kept it a secret from everybody. I can hardly believe it."</p>

	<p>Emma could not speak; she was so confused, and soon realized why Mrs Weston looked ill.</p>

	<p>"Mrs Weston, you have no reason to be upset. I am not in love with Frank Churchill. When I first met Frank Churchill, I did like him, but fortunately, for the past three months, I have felt nothing for him. This is the simple truth," Emma admitted.</p>

	<p>"Mr Weston will be so happy to hear this. We had both wished that you and Frank would marry, and thought you two were in love," Mrs Weston said with a smile.</p>

	<p>"He is to blame, however, Mrs Weston; he did not act as if he were engaged. He was very wrong, very wrong, indeed."</p>

	<p>"He told me there were misunderstandings between them. He suffered, Emma."</p>

	<p>"He did not seem to suffer much. How did Mr Churchill take the news?"</p>

	<p>"He agreed to the marriage immediately."</p>

	<p>"Ah!" thought Emma, "he would have agreed to a marriage with Harriet, as well."</p>

	<p>"Frank told his uncle last night, and came to Highbury this morning. He stopped at the Bates first, then came here. He had not known how ill poor Jane had been, and was shocked to find her in such poor health," Mrs Weston explained.</p>

	<p>"Well, I congratulate you and Mr Weston; you will have one of the most lovely young women in England as your daughter," Emma declared, with a smile.</p>
