	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER EIGHT</p>

	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">Passepartout Talks Too Much</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">F</span>ix soon joined Passepartout. "Well, my friend," said the detective, "is your passport stamped with a visa?"</p>

	<p>"Ah, it's you, monsieur," replied Passepartout. "Thanks, yes, the passport is all right."</p>

	<p>"And you are looking about?"</p>

	<p>"Yes; but we travel so fast that I seem to be journeying in a dream. So this is Suez?"</p>

	<p>"Yes."</p>

	<p>"In Egypt?"</p>

	<p>"Certainly, in Egypt."</p>

	<p>"And in Africa?"</p>

	<p>"In Africa."</p>

	<p>"In Africa!" repeated Passepartout. "Just think, monsieur, I had no idea we would go farther than Paris. All I saw of Paris was an hour and a half through the windows of a car."</p>

	<p>"You are in a great hurry, then?"</p>

	<p>"I am not, but my master is. By the way, I must buy some shoes and shirts. We came away without trunks, only with a bag."</p>

	<p>"I will show you an excellent shop."</p>

	<p>"Really, monsieur, you are very kind."</p>

	<p>They walked off together, Passepartout chatting as they went.</p>

	<p>After a few minutes, Fix said, "You left London quickly, then?"</p>

	<p>"Yes. Last Friday at eight in the evening Monsieur Fogg came home from his club, and three-quarters of an hour later we were off."</p>

	<p>"But where is your master going?"</p>

	<p>"Always straight ahead. He is going around the world, and in eighty days! He says it is on a wager, but I don't believe it."</p>

	<p>"Mr Fogg is a character, is he? Is he rich?"</p>

	<p>"No doubt. He has a large amount of brand new bills with him. He doesn't spare the money, either. He offered a large reward to the engineer of the Mongolia if he gets us to Bombay early."</p>

	<p>"Have you known your master for a long time?"</p>

	<p>"Why, no. I started work the day we left London."</p>

	<p>The detective was already excited, and these replies made him even more so. Fix was sure Phineas Fogg was the thief.</p>

	<p>Fix hurried back to the consulate. "Consul," said he, "I have no longer any doubt. I have spotted my man. He passes himself off as a strange man who is going around the world in eighty days." Fix told the consul about his conversation with Passepartout.</p>

	<p>"What are you going to do?" asked the consul.</p>

	<p>"I'll send a message to London for a warrant to be sent to Bombay. Then I'll follow him to Bombay and politely arrest him."</p>

	<p>Fix left the office and went to the telegraph office, where he sent the telegram we have seen. A quarter of an hour later, Fix was on board the Mongolia, and in a few moments the steamer was on the Red Sea.</p>
