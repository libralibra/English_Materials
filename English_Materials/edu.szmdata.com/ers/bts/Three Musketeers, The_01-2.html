	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER ONE</p>

	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">Leaving Home</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">D'</span>Artagnan did not come from a rich family. When it was his time to leave home and find his fortune in the world, his father only had a few things to give him. The first thing his father gave him was a strange yellow horse&#151;that horse would cause d'Artagnan a lot of trouble in the future. The second thing his father gave him was a letter to Mister Treville, his old friend&#151;this letter would help d'Artagnan find work in Paris. Finally, the old man gave his son fifteen gold pieces and this advice:</p>

	<p>"My son," he began. "You must now leave your family and go out into the world to find fortune and fame. In the world today men become rich by using bravery and their skill with a sword. Take this letter to my old friend, Mister Treville; he will help you. Listen to Mister Treville's words and do what he says. Mister Treville is a great example to follow. When he was your age he left home for Paris to make his fortune. Now he is a powerful and famous man; he is the captain of the Musketeers who guard our great king. Take this letter to him and ask him for work. Work hard and work with honor, my son."</p>

	<p>D'Artagnan took the letter and the gold pieces and went to see his mother. His mother loved her only son and would miss him greatly, but she did not show her tears. She told him to stay safe and gave him a bottle of medicine, which could heal all but death wounds. D'Artagnan kissed her goodbye and jumped on his yellow horse.</p>

	<p>On the first Monday of April 1626 d'Artagnan arrived at the city of Meung. The people in the town watched him ride by on his strange horse. A few young women waved at him from their high windows. D'Artagnan was a tall and strong young man, his face was thin and brave, and his eyes were dark and deep. Though he was only nineteen, he was already quite handsome.</p>

	<p>D'Artagnan was from the town of Gascony. The men of Gascony are famous for being brave when faced with danger and sometimes for having violent moods. He stared into the eyes of the people on the street fiercely.</p>

	<p>Eventually he arrived at an inn and jumped down from his horse. He heard a loud sound of laughter. D'Artagnan turned quickly around on his feet and stared where he had heard the sound.</p>

	<p>There was a window open on the first floor. A man was sitting by the window. He looked about thirty years old; his eyes were sharp and black, and his skin was dark. D'Artagnan saw that the man had a large scar cut into his face above his black beard.</p>

	<p>There were two men sitting next to him. They were both quite large and they were listening to the scarred man's words with great concentration. The stranger was staring at d'Artagnan's yellow horse. He then pointed at the horse, smiled and said something that made his friends again laugh loudly.</p>

	<p>D'Artagnan was quickly filled with anger. He reached down and grasped the handle of his sword and moved towards the window. He pointed at the stranger, "You, sir," he loudly said. "Tell me what you men are laughing at, and we can laugh together!"</p>

	<p>"I was not speaking to you, sir," the man coldly replied.</p>

	<p>"But I was speaking to you!" cried d'Artagnan.</p>

	<p>The stranger looked at him with small eyes. He then stood up and came out of the inn.</p>

	<p>"Your horse," he said, "must have been born of a flower. Yellow flowers are quite common, but yellow certainly is a strange color for a horse."</p>

	<p>The man turned around again and moved a step back towards the inn. D'Artagnan pulled his sword out and yelled: "Turn around, funny sir&#151;or will I have to strike you from behind?"</p>

	<p>The stranger turned around quickly and stared at the young man feeling both surprised and angry. He exclaimed, "Strike me! You must be crazy!"</p>

	<p>D'Artagnan became angrier at the man's words and jumped violently at the stranger with his sword. The stranger was fast with his sword and pulled it out before d'Artagnan could hit him. The stranger's friends rushed out of the inn carrying bats and sticks. They jumped on d'Artagnan, and attacked him from all sides at the same time. One of the stranger's servants hit d'Artagnan's sword and broke it into two pieces. Then a second man hit d'Artagnan on his head and he fell to the ground, unconscious.</p>

	<p>The inn owner looked down at d'Artagnan's body and asked the stranger what to do with him.</p>

	<p>"Take him inside and cure his wounds," the stranger said coldly. "When he wakes up, put him on his yellow horse, and tell him to go back to where he came from."</p>

	<p>The inn owner raised his hand up and two of his servants came over and carried d'Artagnan inside.</p>

	<p>The stranger went back inside and sat back down with his friends.</p>

	<p>A bit later the inn owner returned and asked the stranger if he had been hurt. The stranger smiled.</p>

	<p>"Not at all," he said. "Is the crazy young man awake yet?"</p>

	<p>"He awoke for just a moment before," replied the inn owner. "He said, 'I will tell Mister Treville of this insult to his old friend's son.' Then the young man fell unconscious again."</p>

	<p>"Treville?" the stranger said quietly.</p>

	<p>"I searched his pockets," said the inn owner. "There was a letter in one of them to Mister Treville in Paris."</p>

	<p>"Did you take the letter out of his coat?"</p>

	<p>"No, I put it back into his pocket. Not my affair really. His coat is in the kitchen. If this crazy young man annoys you I can&#151;"</p>

	<p>"He annoys me greatly! Now, prepare my horse at once."</p>

	<p>The inn owner quickly left the room.</p>

	<p>The stranger said quietly to himself, "I am curious to know what is written in this letter to Treville."</p>

	<p>He stood up and walked quietly into the kitchen. D'Artagnan's coat was lying on a chair. The stranger grasped the letter and again stepped quickly out of the room.</p>
