	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">W</span>hen Edna came to Ms Reisz's, she found the woman repairing a pair of boots next to one of the many large windows she had throughout her apartment. She was still wearing the same clothing she had worn at Grand Isle.</p>

	<p>"I thought you would never come. I thought you were just like all those false women who say things they don't mean," Ms Reisz said, stopping her work.</p>

	<p>"Were you hoping I would come?" asked Edna.</p>

	<p>"I'm happy to see you, yes. I guessed that you didn't like me very much."</p>

	<p>"Well, to be honest, I don't really know how I feel about you," Edna replied.</p>

	<p>Ms Reisz appreciated this kind of honesty.</p>

	<p>"You know what? I'm going to get you a cup of coffee," she said, "Please, have a seat." And then she went over to the stove and brought back two hot cups of black coffee.</p>

	<p>"I received a letter from Robert," Ms Reisz suddenly said.</p>

	<p>"He sent you a letter?" Edna asked in surprise as she took a small drink of her coffee.</p>

	<p>"Yes. Is that so surprising? I have to admit, however, he only wrote about you the whole time."</p>

	<p>"Oh, please. Can I read it?" asked Edna, suddenly excited.</p>

	<p>"But it was written to me, for my eyes only."</p>

	<p>"Yes, but you just told me that the whole thing is about me."</p>

	<p>"Oh yes. Mrs Pontellier this, Mrs Pontellier that! He asked me to play his favorite piano piece for you. He wants me to write him back and tell him how you liked it."</p>

	<p>"Can't I read it?"</p>

	<p>"No, sorry."</p>

	<p>"Well, then why don't you play the song he likes for me?"</p>

	<p>"It's starting to get late. Shouldn't you be getting back to your home?"</p>

	<p>"That's not important. Play for me, please."</p>

	<p>"But what have you been doing lately?"</p>

	<p>"Nothing much. Mostly drawing. I'm trying to become an artist, I guess."</p>

	<p>Ms Reisz laughed. "Artists must have natural talent and they must be extremely brave. They have to take risks. It's impossible for them to live normal lives."</p>

	<p>"Let me read the letter and play for me. I won't give up!"</p>

	<p>"Ah! You really are stubborn," Ms Reisz said, laughing. Then she opened a drawer and pulled out an envelope. She handed it to Edna and then walked over to her piano.</p>

	<p>As Edna read, Ms Reisz played Robert's favorite song. The music and the letter made Edna cry. When the song was over, she rose from her chair and walked toward the door. Before walking through it, she turned around and asked if she could visit Ms Reisz again.</p>

	<p>"Of course. Whenever you like."</p>
