	<p class="storyTitle">10. A Test of Faith</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">A</span>braham and Sarah rejoiced in their son, Isaac. Their love for him grew more and more each day. Abraham was very thankful to God.</p>

	<p>God knew that Abraham was a faithful person. Still, there was one more test to show Abraham that God was different from any other gods. God asked Abraham to bring Isaac to a nearby mountain and offer him as a sacrifice.</p>

	<p>Abraham was very troubled, yet he had always trusted in God before. He believed in God's plan for Isaac, so the next morning he took the boy to the mountain as God had asked.</p>

	<p>Isaac helped his father lay the stones for the altar. When it was done, Isaac asked where was the lamb for the sacrifice. Abraham answered, "The Lord will provide that." Then he lifted Isaac onto the altar and took out a knife. Abraham lifted the knife in the air. Just then he heard God calling to him, "Don't hurt your son, Abraham," God said. "You have proved that you truly believe in me by your faith."</p>

	<p>Abraham lifted his son from the altar. In the nearby bush he spotted a ram. Abraham killed it and laid it on the altar to be burned as an offering to God to thank him for sparing Isaac.</p>
