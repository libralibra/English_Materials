	<p class="storyTitle">41. John Is Arrested</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">K</span>ings had much power when Jesus lived. They did almost anything they wanted. King Herod had taken his own brother's wife for himself. Her name was Herodias.</p>

	<p>John the Baptist knew it was against God's laws to take another man's wife. He told Herod that he should not have done this. The king was angry, but not as angry as Herodias.</p>

	<p>She thought John should be killed for criticizing her marriage to the king.</p>

	<p>King Herod knew in his heart that John was a good man. He didn't kill him, but put him in prison instead.</p>

	<p>Sometime later, Herod planned a great party to celebrate his birthday. Herodias' daughter, Salome, was brought out to dance for the king. She was a very good dancer. When she finished dancing, the king asked what reward he could give her.</p>

	<p>Salome ran to speak with her mother, and then came back.</p>

	<p>"I would like you to give me the head of John the Baptist on a plate," she said.</p>

	<p>Herod did not want to kill John, but he could not break a promise in front of so many people. He ordered John killed.</p>
