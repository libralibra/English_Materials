	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER FOURTEEN</p>

	<p class="easyReadingSubTitle">Conversations with an Army Horse</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">D</span>uring my time with this family, I became pretty close to Captain. He had many interesting stories to tell me about his past. One day, he began to tell me about his days as an army horse. He spoke proudly about the strict training he received and how wonderful it had been to walk in line with the other excellent horses, carrying brave soldiers on their backs.</p>

	<p>"But soon we were sent to a place where there was much fighting, with the British and French on one side, and the Russians on the other."</p>

	<p>"And did you get involved in the fighting?" I asked.</p>

	<p>"Of course!" He said. "We were taken to the battle areas and once we heard the officer shout an order, we followed it immediately, no matter what the situation. And let me tell you, there were guns and knives coming at us from all directions most of the time. I carried my master into battle many times without being hurt. I saw horses killed with guns and swords, and I saw brave men die. But my master's courage made me believe that I could never be killed."</p>

	<p>Captain stopped here for a moment, before continuing. He seemed troubled suddenly. "I never felt frightened until one horrible day."</p>

	<p>"What happened?" I asked.</p>

	<p>"Well, it must have been Autumn at the time. It was morning and we were up very early. Everyone seemed excited about today's battle, as if it were going to be a decisive day, somehow. As soon as the enemy started firing their guns, we were ordered into line. My master, being one of the bravest soldiers, got us up to the front of the battle line and said to me 'Captain, today will be a hard battle, but we will not give up the fight!'"</p>

	<p>"Then the officer shouted for us to 'Charge' the enemy. We all ran forward as fast as we could, caring very little about the danger before us. To my right and left I saw many of my companions fall. My master kept me running forward and as we did, the sounds of the guns and enemy shouting became louder and louder. To my right and left I now saw more British horses and soldiers running with me. No one was going to give up, just as my master had said. Seeing this, I became even braver and started running so fast I felt I might soon be flying. But then directly in front of me I saw one of the Russians' biggest guns fire. There was nothing but a cloud of red smoke. And just as my master was shouting encouragement to his fellow soldiers, I heard something fly past my head and my master suddenly became very quiet and stopped moving. The reins loosened and then he fell to the ground."</p>

	<p>"I didn't want to leave him there to be run over by all of the other horses, but there was nothing I could do to help him. I hadn't much time to think about it, because moments later another British soldier jumped onto my back and urged me to run forward."</p>

	<p>"I fought for the rest of the day, until the enemy defeated us. There was blood everywhere and cries of pain all around me. Most of my friends had been killed."</p>

	<p>"What about those who were still alive, like yourself? What happened then?" I asked.</p>

	<p>"We were taken back to England, along with the dead. Those horses who couldn't walk, due to their wounds, were shot. I am guessing that only a fourth of all the horses that had begun that battle went home alive."</p>

	<p>"I continued to fight in the army for many years after that, but I never admired or loved any of my masters the way that I loved and admired the one who died that day. I was injured a few times, but never too seriously, and when the fighting finally stopped, I returned to England, as healthy as I had been before I'd joined the army.</p>

	<p>"Did you ever find out why the countries were at war, or why you were fighting?" I asked.</p>

	<p>"No! It's something humans just do. But the enemy must have been pretty terrible, for so many people have traveled so far to fight."</p>
