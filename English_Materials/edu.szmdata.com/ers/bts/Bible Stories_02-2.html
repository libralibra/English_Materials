	<p class="storyTitle">2. Adam and Eve</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">A</span>mong the living things in the Garden of Eden was a snake. He crawled and hissed like the other snakes, but this snake was really God's enemy, Satan. He came to the garden to destroy all of the lovely things that God had made.</p>

	<p>One day the snake asked Eve if God had told her not to eat the fruit from the trees.</p>

	<p>"No," said Eve, "We can eat any fruit except the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. God said if we eat that fruit we will die."</p>

	<p>"You won't die," said the snake. "You will be wise like God if you eat that fruit."</p>

	<p>Eve looked at the beautiful fruit, and she thought if she could eat it then she would be wise like the snake said. So she picked a piece of the fruit. She bit into it then gave it to Adam so that he could have this wisdom also.</p>

	<p>The wisdom Satan promised did not come. Adam and Eve had disobeyed God and they felt very bad. Later that evening, God called to them but they didn't answer. They went to hide among the trees where they picked leaves to cover their bodies. God called, "Where are you, Adam?"</p>

	<p>Adam and Eve walked very slowly out to meet God. They were afraid of him now because they knew they had done the one and only thing God had asked them not to do.</p>

	<p>God was very sad when he saw Adam and Eve. When he asked Adam if they had eaten the fruit from the forbidden tree, Adam said, "It was Eve who handed me the fruit."</p>

	<p>"I'm not to blame," said Eve. "The snake tricked me." God explained to each of them that they could no longer live in the Garden of Eden because they had disobeyed him. Adam and Eve would have to go out into the world. They would have to work very hard to make crops grow. Weeds and thorns would grow up from the earth. The days would be long and tiring. And when they grew old, Adam and Eve would die and their bodies would return to the earth.</p>

	<p>"You chose to disobey me," said God. "Now you must live apart from me."</p>

	<p>Adam and Eve walked out of the Garden, and God sent angels with flaming swords to guard the entrance so they could not come back.</p>
