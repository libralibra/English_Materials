	<p class="storyTitle">CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">E</span>dna's father got angry when he heard that Edna was unwilling to attend her sister's wedding. Mr Pontellier, taking the advice of Doctor Mandelet, stayed out of the argument entirely. Edna's father was disappointed with her, as he could not persuade her to go with him. He could not imagine what Janet's reaction would be, and he was sure that Margaret would never forgive her.</p>

	<p>Edna was happy to see her father go. Mr Pontellier, left soon afterward, as well. He went to the wedding and gave the newly married couple a large amount of money, hoping to make up for his wife's absence.</p>

	<p>"You're not strong enough with her, Leonce," Edna's father said at the wedding, "You must show women that you are the boss. Don't let them get away with such behavior. That is the only way to deal with them. Believe me."</p>

	<p>Mr Pontellier did not respond, although he did sense that Edna's father's strict treatment of his own wife had eventually caused her death.</p>

	<p>Surprisingly, Edna was not as happy to see her husband go. He would be away for quite a long while. She found herself remembering all of his kindness and devotion all of a sudden. She helped him to pack and told him to be careful while he was away. She even cried as he left and told him that she would be very sad and lonely without him and that she would probably end up joining him in New York.</p>

	<p>But, after he was gone, Edna's feelings were quite different from what she expected. She felt a sense of calm and freedom. Even the kids were not around. Her mother-in-law had taken them to her country home, hoping that they might learn to appreciate life away from the city.</p>

	<p>She walked around her home as though it were her first time being there. She worked in the garden, pulling up the grass that had grown around her flowers. Her neighbor's little dog came and started to play with her as she worked. That evening, she sat down, by herself, to a wonderful dinner and a glass of excellent-tasting wine. Everything seemed to be just perfect. Afterward, she went into the library and read part of a book until she grew too sleepy to continue. Then, following a nice bath, she got into bed under the warmth of the sheets and enjoyed a feeling of relaxation unlike any she had ever felt before.</p>
