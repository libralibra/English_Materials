	<p class="storyTitle">31. The Lord's Tabernacle</p>

	<p class="z"><span class="dropCaps">T</span>he Israelites were ready to do whatever God asked of them. Moses told them to prepare to work six days a week on the tabernacle. No one would work on the seventh day, which was the holy sabbath.</p>

	<p>Moses asked for offerings to go into the tabernacle. People brought gold and silver jewelry and precious stones. Skilled carpenters began to carve the tables and altars. They hung beautiful blue, purple, and red draperies as God had said. This time Moses knew the tabernacle would at last be completed.</p>

	<p>The great cloud the people had seen many times on their journey came again to their camp. It hung over the tabernacle and glowed so brightly the people could not go inside.</p>

	<p>The next morning the cloud lifted from the tabernacle and began to move. This was a sign to the people that the Lord was with them, and they were to continue on their journey together. When the cloud stopped again, the people stopped, too. They put up the tabernacle and went inside to worship.</p>
