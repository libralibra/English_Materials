<p class="quotes">Every day of our lives we are on the verge of making those slight changes that would make all the difference.</p>

<p>It is a bittersweet day when we carefully wrap our holiday ornaments to store in the attic. But years ago, as I was about to take the stockings down, I thought, "If I put these away, there won't be presents in them until next December! That doesn't make sense." So I left one stocking up, where it stays all year. And every so often there's a present in it&mdash;for no reason whatsoever.</p>
<p>Sometimes my husband Bob or I will say to each other, "Have you checked the stocking?" It's never anything big&mdash;maybe a candy bar or a crossword puzzle book.</p>
<p>Every Christmas, we have an elegant dinner by candlelight. This year, as I felt glowingly aware of the uniqueness of the day, time stopped for me in a moment of bliss. And I said to Bob, "Why can't more days be like this?"</p>
<p>"They can't," he said. "This day is special because it comes once a year."</p>
<p>"But that's just in our minds. Life's too short to limit celebrations to what it says on a calendar."</p>
<p>We were savoring Yorkshire pudding when Bob said, "If we had this more often, we wouldn't appreciate it."</p>
<p>"Who says? Every summer when you bite into a lusciously ripe home-grown tomato, you close your eyes in a state of nirvana. Would you want one tomato a year?"</p>
<p>"No," he laughed. "But holidays are different."</p>
<p>"I think you're wrong. It's all what we tell ourselves. I don't want to wait until next December to feel holiday joy."</p>
<p>"But that's when the season comes."</p>
<p>"Why hold off until a certain date to rejoice?" I said. "We don't need an excuse to celebrate. Can't we resolve to make our own tradition of, let's say&nbsp;&#160;...&#160;having the first day of each month a make-your-own holiday? It doesn't have to be a huge deal. And it's only twelve days a year. We could do something special, like order take-out Chinese food&mdash;and eat it by candlelight."</p>
<p>On Christmas, Bob gave me a beautiful glass snow globe. When I gently shake it, snowflakes softly whirl around a dainty evergreen tree. On each limb is a tiny red candle. It's magical to watch the snow swirl as it slowly settles around the tree. And it brings back memories. When I was a little girl I'd watch snow twirl around a ballerina in a globe, making her seem alive as the flakes made their way toward her pink ballet slippers.</p>
<p>I'm not putting Bob's gift away, even though it's a Christmas scene. It's too beautiful to store in the attic. So it will rest on my mantle where I can treasure its beauty. And my favorite ornament, a hand painted oyster shell from Cape Cod, and of course the stocking, will stay downstairs so we can savor more bliss all year long.</p>
<p>I don't want to miss any potential for festivity. Why would I? Where is it written that corned beef is only for St. Patrick's Day or maple-glazed ham for Easter? Plus, must we wait for friends' birthdays to give them presents?</p>
<p>And so, we both made the resolution to celebrate the first day of every month. "If we don't set the date, we may not do it," I said.</p>
<p>And frankly, I think making our own traditions is just as meaningful as conventional rituals. Because they don't come from a calendar. They come from the love in one's heart.</p>
