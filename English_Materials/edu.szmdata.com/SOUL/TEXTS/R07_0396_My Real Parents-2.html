<p>I don't look like the rest of my family. As a matter of fact, I stand out quite a bit with my olive skin and almond eyes. When people see us together it is clear that I am adopted. I am happy to have such a loving and caring family, but sometimes I wish I knew who my birth parents were.</p>
<p>My friends often ask, "Are you sad that you don't know your real parents?" I know that they are just curious and concerned about me&mdash;I'm fine, for the most part&mdash;but I feel like there's something missing in my life, like a giant hole in my heart. My mother listens when I tell her about my feelings, and she feels that it is important for me to be in touch with my culture. Because of this, she and I go to Chinese Heritage Camp each year in Snow Mountain Ranch.</p>
<p>Chinese Heritage Camp is a two-day camp where hundreds of adopted kids like me spend time with each other. We talk about how it feels to be adopted, and we participate in fun outdoor activities. It's great because we can talk about our feelings without having the conversation get too intense. It makes me feel like I am not alone, and that there is someone out there going through the exact same emotions.</p>
<p>Whether we're talking, laughing, crying, or dancing, CHC is always an experience to remember. I adore all of the new people I meet, and I will keep them in my heart forever, because it always feels good to know there are people out there just like me.</p>
<p>Camp has changed the way I look at things. Each year seems to open up new surprises, adventures, and friendships. CHC taught me to learn that being adopted doesn't mean that I'm weird or strange, it just means that I wasn't born into the family I live with. Being adopted won't make my parents love me any less.</p>
<p>Thanks to Chinese Heritage Camp, now when people ask me, "Are you sad you don't know your real parents?" I can safely answer, "Maybe I don't know who my birth parents are, and that makes me a little sad. But I do know that I live with my real parents in a real house, with a real family, and I love my life just the way it is."</p>
