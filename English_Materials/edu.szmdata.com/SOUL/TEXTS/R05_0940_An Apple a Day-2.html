	<p>I never had a weight problem in my younger years. In college, when my friends and I bemoaned our "Freshman Fifteen," I simply gave up dessert and the pounds melted away like ice cream on a July afternoon. In my thirties, I added an hour of aerobic exercise a few times a week and managed to stay trim and fit. Even when I advanced into my forties and gained a permanent five pounds, I felt great and still looked good in a swimsuit.</p>

	<p>But then came the big 5-0.</p>

	<p>Turning fifty flipped a switch in my body. Within a month, five new pounds established themselves around my middle and wouldn't leave, no matter how much I exercised. Half a year later, those five pounds had turned to ten, and on the cold January day I celebrated my fifty-first birthday, I weighed fifteen pounds more than I had the year before.</p>

	<p>Then came the day I couldn't zip a pair of pants that had hung perfectly on my hips a year earlier. Something had to give. I embarked on a diet that included nothing but salad and water. Ugh! I was hungry all the time and felt too tired to exercise. The diet lasted three days, but I continued my exercise: walking two miles a day, several times each week.</p>

	<p>Not long after that, a television program caught my attention. The topic was eating habits and how to control hunger. A high-fiber diet makes you feel full. Apples are a great source of fiber and relatively low in calories. Eat one as you prepare dinner, and you'll be able to control your portions more effectively.</p>

	<p>Why not? I thought. It makes sense&mdash;I'll give it a shot.</p>

	<p>The next day I added apples to my grocery list. I ate one just before lunch and another while preparing dinner: a salad bright with carrots, yellow peppers, green spinach, and fat-free feta cheese alongside a new, low-fat Greek chicken recipe I had found in a magazine. I traded my usual glass of wine with dinner for a glass of Perrier. The chicken was delicious, and I was full after one serving. The apple trick was working. Day One of the new me.</p>

	<p>My low-fat diet and exercise routine continued, but I didn't see much change when I hopped on the scale each morning. Those pounds were as stubborn as the proverbial mule. I ate an apple with a serving of fat-free yogurt for breakfast and tried not to think about it.</p>

	<p>I started walking three miles instead of two and drinking an extra glass of water. My body was not going to win this argument.</p>

	<p>Twelve days later, the scale gave in and declared me a winner. I was three pounds lighter when I stepped into the shower that morning. Ridding myself of the extra pounds was taking longer than when I was in my twenties and thirties, but by golly, I was losing weight.</p>

	<p>Three more pounds disappeared by the end of February, a glacial pace compared to my younger days. But I was determined to win, determined to lose the weight, determined to get back in those pants I still couldn't zip.</p>

	<p>When I went for my annual physical a few weeks later, I stood on the digital scale in the doctor's office and watched in horror as the ten pounds my scale said I had lost registered as only six.</p>

	<p>"That can't be right!" I said, wondering how I could pack on four pounds in a few short hours.</p>
	<p>The nurse looked at me and smiled. "Does your scale say something different?"</p>
	<p>"It must be the wool pants and sweater," I mumbled, stepping off the scale. I wanted to kick it.</p>
	<p>I asked my doctor why it was so hard to lose the weight.</p>
	<p>"Your metabolism slows down as you age," she said. "Do you exercise?"</p>
	<p>"I walk three miles, four times a week."</p>
	<p>"That's good. Keep it up. Do any weights?"</p>
	<p>I didn't, so she suggested adding some hand weights to strengthen my upper body.</p>
	<p>"What about your eating habits?"</p>
	<p>I told her about the apple diet.</p>
	<p>"It can't hurt," she said. "A woman your age needs extra fiber to stay regular."</p>
	<p>Great. Add insult to injury.</p>
	<p>I bought the hand weights and another bag of apples on my drive home.</p>
	<p>"What's for dinner?" my husband asked when he got home from work that evening.</p>
	<p>"Chicken. Any recipe requests?"</p>
	<p>"I liked that Greek chicken you made a few weeks ago."</p>
	<p>So I made his new favorite dish, eating an apple as I cooked.</p>

	<p>The next morning, I added hand weights to my exercise routine. I had to take two ibuprofen that night to battle muscle soreness, but by the end of the week the pain was gone and I had increased the weight repetitions from ten to twenty. Four weeks later, I saw a difference in my arms. The flab was diminishing as muscles developed.</p>

	<p>Although I've had a few setbacks, an apple&mdash;or three&mdash;a day is one of the best secrets to my dieting success. Eating an apple before each meal makes me feel full, which makes portion control a lot easier. And the more I exercise, the better my mood. I really like those little endorphins running around inside my head.</p>

	<p>I can zip that troublesome pair of pants now. But best of all, I wore a sleeveless, size-eight dress to my college reunion this past spring.</p>

	<p>I found my solution to the problem of the "Fifty-something Fifteen" and it all started with a bag of apples.</p>
