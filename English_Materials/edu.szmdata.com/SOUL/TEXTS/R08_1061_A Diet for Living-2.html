<p>My foot hurt as I walked to the mailbox. Confused for a moment, I stopped, stretching my right foot and testing the feel of it. Tears streamed down my face as I walked back into the house and woke my husband with a gentle shake.</p>
<p>"My foot hurts," I said as I woke him and in his grogginess, he simply stared, trying to figure out why this warranted waking him up early and why I was crying.</p>
<p>"My right foot hurts," I repeated, adding emphasis to the word "right." His eyes widened and he grinned.</p>
<p>"It's working?"</p>
<p>"It's working," I replied and sat on the edge of the bed, holding his hand and crying tears of joy.</p>
<div style="text-indent:0px; text-align:center">* * *</div>
<p>The fireplace was crackling and one of the Trans-Siberian Orchestra's Christmas albums was playing while I sat in the middle of the living room floor, merrily wrapping presents.</p>
<p>With a reach and a stretch, I pulled a box to me and immediately felt a twinge in my back. At thirty-two, I was young and in relatively good health, though about 30 pounds heavier than I should be, so I cringed and whined a bit about the pain, but assumed it was nothing major. Then I took some over-the-counter painkillers and went back to my Christmas preparations.</p>
<p>Through the holidays and into the new year, the twinge and pain continued, so in mid-January I found a chiropractor who managed to stop the pain with just a few treatments. About the same time the back pain ended, I noticed my right foot began to go numb and seemed constantly beset with pins and needles. Blaming the chiropractor, I stopped my treatment and went to see my regular physician.</p>
<p>Over the next several months, I had dozens of X-rays and two MRIs. I saw a back surgeon, a neurologist and more of my physician than I ever wanted to.</p>
<p>I raced to the doctor's office, demanding to see someone immediately, the day the nurse called and said my back X-rays showed "something." I had spina bifida occulta, a minor birth defect in my spine that had gone undiagnosed for 32 years.</p>
<p>The X-rays also showed I had a sixth lumbar vertebrae, when normally people have five, and the neurologist mentioned he thought I might have multiple sclerosis. I wept in terror.</p>
<p>By mid-summer, the doctors concluded that I had sciatica. They recommended I lose those extra 30 pounds and perhaps take up some strengthening exercises, maybe yoga or tai chi. For the occasional back spasms, they recommended muscle relaxants and pain killers.</p>
<p>For a while I walked and tried to lose weight, but the constant tripping and stumbling made the doctor's advice difficult to follow. Sitting on a curb with scraped hands and knees as strangers asked if I was okay proved to be too much.</p>
<p>Over the next few years, I packed on another 20 pounds and fought semi-regular bouts of incredible pain. I couldn't walk half a mile without stumbling.</p>
<p>After four years, and a bout of double vision, the original diagnosis of MS reared its ugly head again. This time the lumbar puncture proved beyond a doubt that I had multiple sclerosis.</p>
<p>I cried myself to sleep, convinced the diagnosis doomed me to a wheelchair or worse. I imagined drooling on myself and being unable to take care of my own needs. I also gave up on getting back into shape.</p>
<p>By the fall of 2009, eight years after the original problem, I had put on another 20 pounds and lived a largely sedentary life. The pins and needles had increased in my right foot, sliding up toward my knee. I couldn't put my feet together, climb stairs, or sometimes walk without watching to see where my right foot was as the synapses had slowed their communication with my brain.</p>
<p>Then, someone commented on an article I had written about my MS diagnosis and suggested there might be a link between MS and gluten allergies.</p>
<p>I might have ignored the comment, except it triggered a distant memory of a doctor mentioning when I was a teen that I might have a gluten allergy.</p>
<p>The reporter and investigator in me kicked in and I did some research. Dozens of personal testimonies dotted the Internet. Particularly inspiring was the story of a marathon runner who had been nearly crippled by MS until she stopped eating gluten. Six months later, she was running again.</p>
<p>Never a runner, I had no delusions of such a recovery, but the idea of walking through the mall without stopping to rest or tripping and falling seemed like the promise of a whole new life. I talked it over with my husband and he agreed. We would try a gluten-free diet.</p>
<div style="text-indent:0px; text-align:center">* * *</div>
<p>On a bright and cold November morning, two weeks after purging gluten from our diet, I stepped on a stone on the way to the mailbox and my foot hurt.</p>
<p>As my husband held my hand and I cried, I tried to put into words what it felt like to suddenly feel my foot again. The diet gave me back a limb I had considered virtually useless.</p>
<p>Through the holidays we remained mostly gluten-free, and I felt the other MS symptoms begin to slip away.</p>
<p>For years, I had been told that a diet needs to be a life-changing event, a change in the way we eat and the way we think about eating. Cuter clothes and vague promises of better health were never what I needed to make the change work for me.</p>
<p>I needed measurable results and this time, I got it. I feel my foot!</p>
<p>I still need to work at the diet and overcome eight years of a sedentary life, but gluten-free means that I can suddenly walk down stairs without needing a handrail. The mental fear and distrust of my body lingers, so I worry about trying to run again, but each day my confidence returns a bit more as I discover I can walk without tripping or slide my feet together without looking.</p>
<p>This diet has changed my life. A healthier me is just the beginning.</p>
