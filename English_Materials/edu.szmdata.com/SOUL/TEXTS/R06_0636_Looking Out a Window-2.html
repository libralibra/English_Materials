<p>Following my mother's death after a long battle with breast cancer, my grief was so overwhelming that I stopped functioning for a while. At the same time, my husband's engineering business was struggling, and money was scarce. Christmas was approaching, and I wondered how we were going to buy gifts for our five children.</p>
<p>Two weeks before Christmas, my two walking buddies, Tami and Marian, showed up one morning with a beautifully decorated box. They urged me to open it right then. With trembling fingers, I did so. Inside I found treasure after treasure: exquisite handmade cards complete with stamps, a variety of fine chocolates, and two angel pins.</p>
<p>My eyes filled with tears as I took in the very personal gifts. Each was chosen with care, thought, and love.</p>
<p>The love my friends showed me during what had promised to be a dismal season reminded me that angels were watching over me. These angels appeared in the guise of friends.</p>
<p>Their loving gesture turned my attitude around. I found myself once again excited about Christmas, excited at the possibilities.</p>
<p>For the first time in months, I started looking outward rather than inward. My thoughts turned to others. What could I do to turn around the attitude of someone who was struggling just as I had been?</p>
<p>As my husband said, "You need to look out a window instead of in a mirror."</p>
<p>His words startled me. Was that what I had been doing? Staring in a mirror? Had I become so self-absorbed, so self-involved, that I had forgotten that others had problems?</p>
<p>The unfortunate answer was "Yes."</p>
<p>I resolved then and there to find what was positive in my life and to share that with others. I didn't have much money, but I did have time. I started to share that. I volunteered to take a seventyish widow in our church to doctor appointments and to the grocery store. I wrote cards to people who I knew were lonely and needed an extra dose of love.</p>
<p>My prayers were full of thanksgiving. I consciously counted my blessings and found them overwhelming. A husband who loved me. Sweet children who tried their best to help whenever they could. A group of devoted friends who were always there for me.</p>
<p>And then I did something that appeared to have nothing to do with building a positive attitude: I cleaned house. No, I don't mean scrubbing toilets (though I did that as well). I cleared out the clutter.</p>
<p>The clothes that no longer fit were sent to a charity thrift store. Books that had been read and re-read were donated to the local library for its yearly sale. Toys that the children no longer played with were given to a family with young children.</p>
<p>There was something freeing in cleaning out the clutter that had collected over the years.</p>
<p>Even as I was getting rid of unwanted items, I questioned my actions. Our family was struggling financially. Could we really afford to give things away? Should I save them for the garage sale I was always planning to hold? Shouldn't I be trying to make money?</p>
<p>The quiet peace in my heart was answer enough.</p>
<p>Cleaning out the physical clutter in my life prompted me to clean out the clutter in my heart. I made an effort to let go of old grudges and hurts. I worked to banish the obstacles that were holding me back from being the kind of person I wanted to be.</p>
<p>Can helping others and cleaning out clutter work for everyone in their quest of a positive attitude? Maybe. Maybe not.</p>
<p>But they, along with a pair of angels in sneakers and sweats, helped me find my way back to looking out a window rather than staring in a mirror.</p>
