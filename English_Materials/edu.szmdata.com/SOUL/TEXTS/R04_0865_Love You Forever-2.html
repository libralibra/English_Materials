<p>No one is ever ready to say goodbye to a parent, and I was no exception. When my mother suddenly passed away at the age of fifty-five, it was devastating. The only way I knew how to cope was to write. When it came time to write her eulogy, I welcomed the chance to honor her. After reading the eulogy at her funeral, I folded it neatly and tucked it between the pages of her favorite children's book, <em>Love You Forever</em>. When it was time to pay final homage to her, I felt satisfied as I placed my only copy of the book in her arms and helped to lower her casket.</p>
<p>Shortly thereafter though, I broke down. I could think of nothing but my mother. I missed her with every cell in my body. But most overwhelmingly, I could no longer grasp the concept of where she had gone. I found it impossible to believe that she was watching over me. If she were, I thought, then she would surely make her presence known. I pleaded with the Heavens to show me she was there, that she was still sending her love, and keeping a watchful eye. No such luck.</p>
<p>Weeks went by. I became depressed and broken, unable to fulfill simple tasks and care for myself. I stayed home. People came in and out, checking on me at all hours of the day. Family and friends tried to coax me out of the house, but all I wanted to do was hide. I wanted to hide from my harsh reality: I would never see or hear from my mother again. Finally, those who cared about me had had enough.</p>
<p>One night, my best friend and her partner came over with a plan to get me out of the house. I debated with them for over an hour, pleading for them to leave me alone. Two hours and a million excuses later, we finally compromised and I allowed them to take me on a quick trip to Target.</p>
<p>As we walked through the aisles my feet dragged. I didn't want to be there. I didn't want to be anywhere. Nonetheless, we perused the make-up, electronics, and home goods aisles. They were there to offer me an outlet, and I was only there to placate them. After several more minutes of mindless meandering I was done. I told them I had to go back home, that I needed to get out of there.</p>
<p>"Alright, but first we have to stop by the candy section. A little sugar will give you a pick-me-up," they reasoned.</p>
<p>I swallowed my pain and continued. I picked out a piece of candy just to avoid my friends' concerned stares. At the checkout, we dropped our items on the conveyor belt and waited in line. I looked at the merchandise arrayed at the checkout. At the top of a shelf, on top of the candy, hair ties, and hand sanitizer, sat a book, a copy of <em>Love You Forever</em>! I snatched the copy and skimmed the pages, enjoying the pictures of a mother cradling her child. Tears welled in my eyes.</p>
<p>"Ma'am? Ma'am? How would you like to pay for this?" the cashier asked.</p>
<p>I snapped back to reality, but ignored her question. "Why is this book here?" I demanded to know.</p>
<p>"I'm not sure, ma'am. Maybe someone was planning to buy it but chose not to in the end? They were probably just too lazy to put it back&#160;...&#160;It happens all the time, unfortunately. Thanks for pointing it out."</p>
<p>I felt compelled to know more, and am still not sure why I asked my next question.</p>
<p> "Where are the rest of the copies of this book?"</p>
<p>"Wow. You sure love that book. The rest are probably in our book section, but I'll scan it just to make sure. Sometimes when a book is on promotion it is moved."</p>
<p>She scanned it. The machine made a loud, shrill beep.</p>
<p>"Huh. That's weird. It's not scanning. Let me see&#160;...&#160;"</p>
<p>The few moments I waited felt like eternity. A ball of excitement mixed with anxiety formed in my stomach.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry, ma'am. This book isn't scanning because we have no other copies in-store. In fact, we haven't for a while. It says the last time we had this book in stock was two and a half years ago. I'm not really sure why it was sitting there&#160;...&#160;If you'd like to buy it ma'am, I apologize because I guess it's not really available for purchase. But&#160;...&#160;I mean&#160;...&#160;I guess you can&#160;...&#160;Just take it? It's not really ours to sell."</p>
<p>My heart fluttered as I gingerly took back the book. I cradled it in my arms and as I did, I felt a sense of security envelop me. I knew this was a message from my mother. It was a message of love, support, and understanding. It was her way of saying, "I will love You Forever, no matter what." And I've never doubted that since.</p>
