</div>	

	<p>My husband and I prepared for the arrival of our first baby with the attention of a general preparing for an invasion. We did it all: Lamaze classes, nutrition classes, even a pregnancy bra fitting, not an easy task for a girl who had been brought up to be modest at any cost.</p>

	<p>No amount of preparation, though, could equal the reality of giving birth.</p>

	<p>Two hours into labor, I promised to devote myself to good works if I survived.</p>

	<p>My husband held up a wedding picture for me to focus on. I ripped it to shreds and snarled, "I want drugs."</p>

	<p>"But, honey," my hapless spouse said, "we decided we were going to have a natural birth."</p>

	<p>I grabbed him by the neck of his hospital gown. "You have it natural. I want drugs."</p>

	<p>With my promise that I'd take a contract out on his life if he ever laid a hand on me (translation: got me pregnant) again ringing in his ears, he meekly asked the nurse for painkillers.</p>

	<p>At six hours, I vowed celibacy for the rest of my life as the back pains hit. You know the ones I mean&mdash;the kind that make the Inquisition rack seem like a session with a masseuse.</p>

	<p>By the tenth straight hour of agonizing pain, I changed my mind and decided to skip the hit man. I'd do it myself. I fantasized about ways to do in this man I'd promised to love and cherish. First, though, I'd make him suffer.</p>

	<p>Twelve hours into labor, I heard my husband excuse himself to go have breakfast. </p>

	<p>Seriously? The monster abandons me in my hour of need and goes to have breakfast? Death was too good for him.</p>

	<p>In between screaming, I plotted. Suffering took on new meaning.</p>

	<p>The doctor had yet to arrive. Alone with the nurse from Hades, I felt an uncontrollable need to push.</p>

	<p>"Get this thing out of me!" I yelled.</p>

	<p>"Pant, honey," the whey-faced nurse with ferret-like eyes encouraged.</p>

	<p>"You pant."</p>

	<p>"We don't have to be unpleasant," she chided.</p>

	<p>"We don't have to be anything," I snarled through gritted teeth.</p>

	<p>She snagged a doctor unfortunate enough to stroll into the room.</p>

	<p>"I'm not an obstetrician," he whined. "I'm a proctologist."</p>

	<p>With my last ounce of strength, I roused myself and grabbed him by the neck of his green scrubs. "I don't care if you do nose jobs," I said in a voice hoarse from screaming. "I want this thing out of me, and I want it out now."</p>

	<p>He stuck his head between my legs and held out his hands just in time to catch a nine-pound squalling scrap of humanity&mdash;a beautiful daughter.</p>

	<p>Eventually, I forgave my husband and allowed him to touch me again. The pain of giving birth must have faded for I endured it three more times. Each brought a miracle.</p>

	<p>Thank heaven for drugs.</p>
