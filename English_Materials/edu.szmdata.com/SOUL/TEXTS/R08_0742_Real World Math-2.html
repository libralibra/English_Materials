<p>It was my first year as a middle school math teacher, and in an effort to motivate and engage my students, I designed and implemented a classroom money system. Each day, students who came to class prepared earned a salary of twenty-five "royal" dollars. From the salary earned, the students paid monthly rent on their chairs and taxes on their classroom materials. My goals for the program were to help students learn the importance of financial management while also promoting positive classroom behavior.</p>
<p>I gave students daily opportunities to earn additional salary in the form of bonuses, such as ten dollars for catching my errors, fifty dollars for good mathematical arguments, and one hundred dollars for acing an assessment. Students deposited any money they earned in our class bank. As the banker, I maintained the accounts and notified students of dangerously low balances. After all, students knew what happened in the "real world" when you didn't have the money to pay rent, and none wanted to be evicted from his or her chair.</p>
<p>I explained that at the end of each quarter, after the students paid their rent, taxes and any fines, they could use discretionary money to bid on items in a class auction. Auction items varied from quarter to quarter, but typical fare included small trinkets, snacks, and school supplies.</p>
<p>My system worked beautifully. The students were fully engaged, especially when I began to distribute cash bonuses. I decided I could also minimize classroom disruptions if I levied fines. Students soon realized that use of inappropriate language or arriving tardy to class was not financially beneficial.</p>
<p>Three weeks into school Mayra met me at the door with a question.</p>
<p>"How much would it cost to buy my chair?"</p>
<p>"Buy your chair?"</p>
<p>"Well, if I could buy my chair, I won't have to pay you rent each month. Then I'll have more money to spend at the auction."</p>
<p>"That's really great thinking," I replied. "Let me think about it and I'll let you know."<br /> I quickly calculated a reasonable purchase price and announced to the class, "If you prefer to save your money and purchase your chair, you can buy it for six hundred dollars."</p>
<p>Mayra's hand immediately shot up.</p>
<p>"So if I sit on the floor for twenty more days, I'll have enough money to buy my chair. Can I do that?"</p>
<p>Without fully processing the implications of her plan, I responded, "Absolutely!"</p>
<p>She and several of her tablemates began to gather their materials and reposition themselves on the hard, wooden floor of our classroom. I thought to myself, "This will never last. They will be back in their chairs within a few minutes."</p>
<p>I certainly underestimated the resolve of middle school penny pinchers. Not only did Mayra and her crew last the hour, they resumed their positions the following day, with several peers joining in. By the end of the week, almost the entire class had selected seating on the floor. Each day, I stepped precariously over students to reach those who had questions. While it was slightly inconvenient for me, I reminded myself that these students were making a conscious decision to be frugal with their money.</p>
<p>The following Tuesday was Open House. Parent after parent flowed in to meet the teacher who was charging rent. They relayed stories of enthusiasm for the program from both their perspective and their child's. "Thank you for teaching my child the value of money!" was a common refrain. I was now more motivated than ever to continue.</p>
<p>Two weeks later, Mayra arrived at my door announcing, "Today, I can buy my chair!"</p>
<p>I looked at the handwritten ledger she excitedly held. With no direction from me, she had recorded each deposit she had made to the bank. After verifying her accounting, I announced congratulations to her. She proudly took her "purchased" seat at her assigned table.</p>
<p>At the end of class, Mayra approached me with another question, "Now, can I save more money and buy Jos&eacute;'s chair, and then charge him higher rent?"</p>
<p>I laughed. Clearly, my goal of improving financial management had been met by at least one of my students and I'm sure those skills will serve her well in the future.</p>
