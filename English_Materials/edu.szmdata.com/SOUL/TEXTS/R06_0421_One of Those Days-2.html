<p>It was one of those days.</p>
<p>I'd been cooped up in the house with two kids, had a work deadline, and could feel a sinus infection coming on.</p>
<p>The day had started pretty well. That morning, I was cuddling in bed with seven-year-old Jordan and two-year-old Jackson. Jordan said, "Jackson is so cute, I could die!"</p>
<p>Contented sigh.</p>
<p>But it was all downhill from there. Later that day, Jordan and Jax were playing with markers. At one point, I noticed that Jordan had scribbled "kick me" on Jax's lower back above his diaper. I had to laugh, but I also had to work at getting the marker off with an unscheduled bath.</p>
<p>As for the newly tattooed toddler, his day was spent screaming at the top of his lungs and taking off his diaper.</p>
<p>By two o'clock, I was ready to run out the door screaming. When the baby's naptime finally came, I tried to work, but then I realized that this was one of those times when I just needed to be still.</p>
<p>And so I was.</p>
<p>Turning off the computer, I poured myself a cup of tea, sat in my favorite chair and opened my journal.</p>
<p>With a smile, I saw that my life hadn't changed much in the past few months. One entry read: "Jordan brought me two dead crickets, a fake fingernail, and (oh, yes!) some crumpled rose petals from the bush in the backyard." As I kept reading about my little boys' antics, I started to chuckle. Hey, I thought, I don't need sitcoms or the funny papers. I have two boys!</p>
<p>Continuing in a quiet&mdash;and slowly improving&mdash;mood, I opened the scriptures.</p>
<p>The book of Isaiah is a particular favorite when I'm feeling insecure, frustrated or unsure. Once again, I was comforted and encouraged by the Word, and by being in God's presence.</p>
<p>I didn't hear any audible voices or bells ringing, but as I told my husband later, "The crazies went away." I was able to regain my equilibrium and realize that it's okay to feel nuts once in a while. God loves me anyway.</p>
<p>Contented sigh.</p>
<p>Those moments of grace in the midst of mommyhood help me remember that each day, with God's strength, I'm doing the best I can in the roles I've been given.</p>
<p>And that's enough.</p>
<p>I need those times with my Maker to remind me that my boys are not burdens&mdash;they are my biggest blessings! In the midst of Crazyville, He helps me keep my perspective&mdash;and a sense of humor.</p>
