	<p>I stood on the front porch blinking back tears I refused to cry, watching Olivia's pretty face glance sadly back from the window as they pulled away. Kentucky&nbsp;&#160;...&#160;practically a country away from where I stood and, as Anne of Green Gables would say, my "bosom friend" was moving there. All I could choke out after her was, "Don't forget to remember me."</p>

	<p>Olivia isn't just a friend; she is my "kindred spirit," sister in Christ, writing pal and all-around best friend. We share more than interests; we share faith, dreams, and real passions. Why did she have to leave me?</p>

	<p>I went inside feeling like God had let me down. Olivia's moving was hard, but I knew He brought us together and would hold us together through time and distance because He is greater and stronger than both, but what bothered me was that just after finding out her family planned to move, Chicken Soup for the Soul had chosen one of my poems for publication. It was my first published piece and, being a fellow aspiring writer, Olivia was more ecstatic than I was. And best of all, especially with her pending move, it was a poem I had written for her. God has a way of making beautiful memories out of heartbreaking experiences.</p>

	<p>I wanted so much to give Olivia a copy of the book with her special poem in it in person, as a parting gift, but this was our last visit and the books hadn't come yet. I kept asking God why He couldn't have made them come in time. I failed to remember that His timing is always on time.</p>

	<p>After watching her go I slipped upstairs to my room, my chest feeling both heavy and empty, took my cedar wood box from its place on a shelf, lifted the lid and took out the small pile of envelopes that were held safely in its keep. One by one I opened the cards and letters, smelling of sweet cedar like a peaceful forest, and read the notes my "bosom friend" had written me over time. They made me smile, laugh and cry all at once. The secret names we'd given each other, our "top secret" alphabet, cards, letters of sisterly love, etc. They all meant so much to me, but one card stood out among the rest. It was the Valentine's Day card Olivia had made me when I was away for a long while and getting lonesome and homesick. It had a wonderful poem on the front that brought tears to my eyes the first time I read it, and now tears filled my eyes again. I hadn't lost her. This wasn't goodbye. I closed the card, breathing in another wisp of that forest fragrance, clutched it to my chest and whispered, "Thank you God, I'm sorry for thinking you let me down. Your perfect timing is always right. I still trust you."</p>

	<p>The next afternoon the box of <em>Chicken Soup for the Soul: Just for Preteens</em> books arrived, each holding my poem, "Heart to Heart," under the chapter name, "Friendships to Last a Lifetime." A perfect name to describe our friendship, a perfect chapter to promise this wasn't the end&nbsp;&#160;...&#160;and it was one day too late. Or so I thought. But, as usual, God had a plan that was better than my own. "It will give you an excuse to see her again!" Mom said. "Call and see if she can swing by and get it on their way through." I hugged my wonderful mom and dashed upstairs to call Olivia. "I have something I have to give you before you go. Will you be coming through town on your way to Kentucky?" She didn't know for sure but promised to let me know when she did. It was Thursday night and they'd be leaving Saturday.</p>

	<p>I hung up the phone with peace in my heart. This was why the books had come a day later. If they had come when I thought, the day before would have been our last "see you soon" (we had decided not to say "goodbye"). But instead, angels carried them here just one day "too late" and God gave me the gift of seeing her off on the long road ahead and getting that one last hug in the memorable parting I had so badly wanted.</p>

	<p>I wrote a note on the inside cover of her book, tucked another telling her what page held the poem and how much I was going to miss her inside, and set it on the counter, knowing she would come by.</p>

	<p>Saturday afternoon, she did. I ushered her in the door and took the book from its place on the counter, handing it to her without a word. I was afraid if I said anything I'd burst into tears. She held it in her hands for a moment, saying, "Oh my gosh, I can't believe it's here! I can't believe it's here!" Her beautiful blue eyes filled with tears, and that was it for me. I hugged her tight and squeaked out, "I love you, Liv."</p>

	<p>"I love you too," she squeaked back. Mom grabbed the camera and snapped a couple of shots of us, teary-eyed and smiling, and Chicken Soup for the Soul actually ran one of those shots with a story on Liv and me in their contributor newsletter a couple of months later.</p>

	<p>After one more big hug, Olivia clutched the book and headed back to the truck. I stood in the driveway, still crying, and waved "see you soon" as they pulled away. Olivia's pretty face glanced back, wet with tears, but that contagious smile of hers was shining through this time. I'll never forget that look. It was the kind of goodbye I had prayed for, the kind that is treasured and remembered.</p>

	<p>When the truck was out of sight I turned to find Mom's open arms. She was crying too. Mom, my little brother and I had a tearful group hug and headed in. I took one more look over my shoulder. The road was empty, but my heart was full again.</p>
	<p>The Bible verse on the last card I sent Olivia read:</p>
	<p>"Love never gives up, never loses faith, is always hopeful, and endures through every circumstance." (1 Corinthians 13:7)</p>
	<p> That must be what had filled my heart because I was hopeful, I had faith, and I knew this friendship would endure through the circumstances.</p>
	<p>Moments later, Olivia texted me (she doesn't like texting, but I was out of minutes and I guess I'm special enough for her to make an exception). It read: "Crying. Thank you. It's more beautiful than you know." It was just a simple poem, but it was written from one heart to another.</p>
	<p>I gazed out at the hills to the east where my "kindred spirit" was heading, and whispered what was written inside the cover of the book she was holding somewhere on the road right then&nbsp;&#160;...&#160;</p>

	<p class="poemLine">"Until soon again,</p>
	<p class="poemLine">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My dear friend,</p>
	<p class="poemLine">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will remember you in the sunrise.</p>
	<p class="poemLine">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remember me in the sunset&nbsp;&#160;...&#160;</p>
	<p class="poemLine">The poem says the rest."</p>
