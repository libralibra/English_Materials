	<p>For years I was unhappy with most of the gifts I received for my birthday, Christmas or other occasions. I put a lot of thought into the gifts I gave to others, and it seemed to me that that they did not return the favor.</p>

	<p>Didn't those closest to me know that I didn't enjoy reading romance novels? Or that gadgets for my car would go unused? And surely they should have figured out that if they wanted to get me a food gift it had to be chocolate! But no, the stream of gifts that I put in the back of my dresser drawer, gave away, or even sometimes threw away, continued.</p>
	<p>I didn't speak up. I didn't want to hurt the feelings of those I loved and cared about, but my resentment began to grow. I felt like the most important people in my life didn't really know me, or maybe didn't care enough about me to think about my likes and dislikes.</p>
	<p>One day I was unwrapping a birthday gift from my teenage son&mdash;a blouse more stylish than I felt comfortable wearing. My first thought when I peeled back the tissue paper and saw the blouse was that it was another candidate to hang in the back of my closet. But when I looked up at Jason's face and saw him smiling at me with anticipation, I finally got it. It was an epiphany that made me readjust the attitude of a lifetime in a moment.</p>
	<p>"What do you think, Mom?" Jason asked, barely waiting for me to pull the blouse out of the box. "I thought it would look so nice on you."</p>
	<p>"It's beautiful," I was able to say authentically as I hugged him. In that moment of clarity I realized that Jason saw me as someone who would be open to receiving and wearing something more elegant than my usual attire. He wanted to give me something special.</p>
	<p>"Try it on&mdash;I want to see how it looks," Jason added.</p>
	<p>"I know just the skirt to try it with," I said as I headed towards my closet.</p>
	<p>When I re-entered the living room with the outfit on, Jason was waiting. "It looks just like I thought it would. It's pretty on you, Mom," Jason said.</p>
	<p>I tried to stop the tears that were welling in the corner of my eyes. "Thank you, honey. It is a beautiful blouse. I can tell you put a lot of thought into picking it out."</p>

	<p>"You're welcome Mom&mdash;glad you like it," Jason said, and he continued to smile as he gave me another quick hug before he walked away.</p>
	<p>Jason probably wondered why I was so emotional over the gift. He had no way of knowing that he'd given me much more than a blouse.</p>
	<p>I began to think back on gifts I'd rejected as a bad fit for me and grasped the fact that maybe the people who gave me the gifts saw something in me that I didn't see in myself. They might have thought I was more romantic, or adventurous, or saw me as a better cook than I gave myself credit for. I began to see myself as others saw me. That opened me up to change and growth.</p>
	<p>In the years since I received Jason's present, I have rarely felt disappointed when a gift doesn't match my interests or desires. I go into holidays with no expectation of receiving anything, and then everything I receive becomes a blessing. The idea that someone thinks of me, and spends precious time, thought and money to purchase and wrap a gift is more than enough for me. It is amazing how much more pleasant each occasion is, and how much more I appreciate my family and friends since this insight.</p>
	<p>There is definitely something special about receiving a gift that is perfectly suited for you. But I have found it is just as special to receive all gifts with an open mind and a grateful heart and spirit.</p>
