<p>When I decided my girlfriend Maria was the woman I wanted to marry, I told her I wanted to date her exclusively. A good friend of ours suggested we start "courting."</p>
<p>Since neither Maria nor I knew the difference between courting and dating, our ever-helpful friend quickly pointed out they were similar, but with significant differences. "Appropriate physical boundaries" needed to be respected; and a dedicated commitment would enable us to grow individually and as a couple.</p>
<p>Finally, according to my friend, courtship meant every time Maria and I saw each other, I was to give her a quarter. Yes, that's right&mdash;a quarter. Is this some mysterious, ancient ritual, I wondered? "Never mind," said my friend. "Just do it."</p>
<p>So I took the "quarter" challenge, and decided to make a game of it. It became second nature to check my pockets for the appropriate pieces of silver. A dime wouldn't do. I hid quarters under her plate in a restaurant or left them with notes on her steering wheel, or gently slipped them into her hand as we walked to the movies.</p>
<p>I loved to see the excitement and joy in her face every time I gave her a quarter. She saved each one and collected them in a green corduroy drawstring bag. When we were apart, Maria would hold the bag and think of all the fun we shared.</p>
<p>Finally, the right time came for me to ask the Big Question. Almost finished with our premarital classes at the church, I'd never been more positive about a decision in my life. But doubt crept into my mind&mdash;did Maria feel the same way?</p>
<p>More than anything, I wanted the proposal to be special and to incorporate our "quarter theme." Carefully, I formulated my plan.</p>
<p>First, I chose a nice restaurant across from the performing arts center and bought tickets to a jazz show I knew she wanted to see. Then, I put words onto paper about how much Maria meant to me:</p>


<p><em>The Last Quarter</em></p>

<p class="poemLine">In the first quarter a comfort level was formed,</p>
<p class="poemLine">In the second quarter a friendship was spawned,</p>
<p class="poemLine">In the third quarter silver tokens of affection did abound,</p>
<p class="poemLine">And in this final quarter&mdash;my true love I have found.</p>

<p><em>This is the last "quarter" I will give you to celebrate our "courting" stage. For today I ask you to be my wife, and in exchange for the silver tokens that daily show my love, I humbly ask you to accept a silver ring, and thus daily share my life. I love you, Maria.</em></p>
<p><em>Ward</em></p>

<p>I framed the poem and letter and placed a quarter inside, too. I arranged with the manager of the restaurant to have the frame placed on a secluded table with the menus set directly over it. My plan? When Maria lifted the menus she would find the poem and, at that point, I would drop to my knees and propose.</p>
<p>On the way to the restaurant, I felt confident. At least until Maria grabbed hold of my hand in the car.</p>
<p>"Your hand is clammy. Are you nervous about something?"</p>
<p>I made some lame joke in response while thinking, "This woman knows me pretty well." I took that as another sign I'd made a good decision.</p>
<p>About five minutes after we sat down, Maria lifted her menu and saw the framed poem beneath it. She picked it up and exclaimed, "Hey, they've got a quarter theme, too!"</p>
<p>I didn't say a word. Maria was still reading. A look of confusion crossed her face. I guessed she reached my name at the bottom. That was my cue.</p>
<p>I knelt down beside her and asked her those four little words: "Will you marry me?"</p>
<p>Well, would she? There was a tantalizing moment before everything sank in. Finally, Maria said the one word I most wanted to hear.</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>The waiter brought the champagne on cue. As we laughed and held each other, I handed Maria my cell phone, programmed with her mother's number, so she could tell her mom the good news.</p>
<p>Within a short while, Maria and I married. All the quarters I gave her remained in the same bag, sitting next to the framed poem.</p>
<p>Our marriage was wonderfully happy, but I found I missed our quaint little custom. So I planned another surprise. Over a year later, we moved into our new home and had a special dinner on Valentine's Day. When Maria opened a box of chocolates she found&mdash;wrapped in tissue in place of a chocolate&mdash;a quarter.</p>
<p>She looked at me, mystified. "Why am I getting a quarter?"</p>
<p>"I miss 'quarting' you." I rolled the quarter up her arm. "I want to quart you and court you for the rest of my life!"</p>
<p>Since then, I've been giving Maria a quarter every day. Sometimes I put them in the most unexpected places.</p>
<p>Maria puts all the "new" quarters in a ceramic jar on her nightstand. She stores them in quart-size mason jars in her hope chest and promises to keep them forever. I've no idea how many are in her collection, but I do know that many quarters make infinite riches&mdash;of love.</p>
