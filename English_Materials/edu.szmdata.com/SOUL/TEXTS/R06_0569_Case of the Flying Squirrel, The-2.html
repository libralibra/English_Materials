<p>Summer had finally arrived, after a long Canadian winter and a wet spring. The only problem was that the summer was looking like "monsoon season" and was putting a damper on my desire to go camping. But my husband had pulled our trailer to the mountains by the middle of June and I had promised that after the first weekend in July, I would join him. Friends that we camped with every year were also at the campground awaiting my arrival. I decided, rather grudgingly, to go even though the skies were dark and cloudy and the weather reports promised more rain.</p>
<p>It was good to see everyone and the next few weeks were a flurry of shared dinners and visits around the campfire. I spent time reading, walking with friends and taking photographs of the stunning mountains, sky and wildlife.</p>
<p>One evening as night closed in, we sat around the campfire laughing and teasing one another. Suddenly there was a crunching sound. We stared beyond the fire, into the darkness. Something was out there.</p>
<p>"Did you hear that?" one lady asked.</p>
<p>"I heard it," I said. My heart began to pound wildly. Maybe the cougar spotted a few days earlier had returned.</p>
<p>Silence prevailed as we strained to see anything beyond the rim of firelight. There was a plopping sound, then a grey creature moved across the gravel, just beyond the light.</p>
<p>What was it? We held our breath as the thing again dropped onto the gravel and scurried out of sight beyond our friend's trailer.</p>
<p>"Maybe it's a flying squirrel," someone said.</p>
<p>There was another plop and disappearance near the trailer. Something seemed odd. What was it?</p>
<p>A friend grabbed his camera and waited for the creature to return. We waited and waited. "I think it's gone," someone said.</p>
<p>But it landed again and just as quickly vanished.</p>
<p>"You'll have to tell me when to shoot," our camera buff said to me. "I can't see it fast enough."</p>
<p>I stood and waited. "Now," I shouted, and he tried but was unable to get a picture of the strange rodent.</p>
<p>He moved to the rim of the firelight, positioning himself for a better shot, then began to laugh. There was a crunching of gravel and from beyond the trailer's darkened end emerged the thirty-something son of a couple who were sitting around the campfire. He carried a fishing rod. On the end of the fishing line was a grey sock, stuffed to give it a head and body. We had all been duped by a flying grey sock!</p>
<p>Laughter prevailed. We sat long into the evening reminiscing of past years and other pranks. I smiled as I pulled a blanket around me to keep out the encroaching night chill. Yes the camping weather differed from most summers but the friendship remained the same. I looked at the faces, with firelight dancing across them, and thanked God for this group of friends. No, I corrected myself, these were more than friends. They were family, chosen summer family. And my heart swelled with love for them. I pulled the blanket closer and smiled. There was no place I'd rather be.</p>
