<p>I never thought I'd be a "runner."</p>
<p>I was the girl who finished her laps last in gym class. The girl who got winded after two flights of stairs. The girl who complained of blisters after a two-minute jog.</p>
<p>Pretty pathetic, really.</p>
<p>But a few years ago, I changed my tune. I was walking with a group of friends in the Race for the Cure, a 5K race designed to raise money for the fight against breast cancer, when one lady caught my eye.</p>
<p>She was one of the frailest looking women I've ever seen. She must have been close to seventy years old, wearing a bandanna to cover her bald head and a T-shirt with the word "Survivor." She was so small that it seemed as if a swift breeze could tip her over.</p>
<p>But, she was running.</p>
<p>And she was passing me and my group of twenty-something friends.</p>
<p>I couldn't stop staring at her. She ran slowly, but determinedly&mdash;as if each step pushed her cancer further into her past. She was practically stomping on her cancer every time her feet touched the ground.</p>
<p>Then, I looked at my friends. Here we were, in the prime of our lives, and this seventy-year-old cancer survivor was kicking our butts!</p>
<p>Right at that moment, I swore that in the next Race for the Cure, I'd be running along with her.</p>
<p>A week later, I found myself at the gym, tentatively approaching the treadmill. I got on and started to jog.</p>
<p>Three minutes after I started, my face was bright red. I was oozing sweat and felt like my lungs were going to burst. I had to slow down to a walk. I thought about the woman at the race. She made it look so easy.</p>
<p>I kept it up.</p>
<p>I was able to go a little longer each time. Three and a half minutes. Four minutes. Five.</p>
<p>A year later, I was at the Race for the Cure again, but this time, I queued with the runners.</p>
<p>When the race started, streams of runners passed me by. But I concentrated on putting one foot in front of the other. One step at a time, I ran forward.</p>
<p>By the second mile, my legs felt like rubber. But I kept moving forward.</p>
<p>As the end of the race approached, I wondered if I'd be able to do it. But then, I remembered the woman from the year before. One foot in front of the other, I ran as fast as I could until I finally crossed that finish line.</p>
<p>The sense of euphoria was incredible. I had just finished my first race! I had run just over three miles without stopping.</p>
<p>I looked down at my legs, amazed. They had done something I'd never thought possible. I have never felt stronger than in that moment.</p>
<p>And, I knew that I wanted to do it again.</p>
