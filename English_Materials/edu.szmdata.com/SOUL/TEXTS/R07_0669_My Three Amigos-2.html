</div>	

	<p>Birdsong and butterflies filled the air and threads of sunlight pierced through the canopy of trees as I walked along the lane outside the ancient city of Pompeii. It was lovely and serene. I, however, was far from peaceful; I was a very damp basket case.</p>

	<p>In just a few moments, I was due at the Villa de Misteri office to interview the chief archaeologist for the Vesuvius area. My interview questions were prepared, but I was not only nervous, I was as hot as a grilled sausage in the only business outfit I'd brought. A winter suit. Who knew that in late October in Italy, the temperatures could be unseasonably hot?</p>
	<p>Some women "glow" when hot, others might perspire. Me, I flat out sweat. Torrents of water poured off my head, down my face and spouted off the end of my nose. Hardly the way to conduct a dignified interview.</p>
	<p>I'd already had a few bad moments in Italy. In Rome I somehow managed to break security at the Vatican and ended up in the Papal courtyard. As the Swiss Guard grabbed my arm and two others ran over, I quickly prayed to Saint Peter to put a good word in for God to help me. This was his house; surely he knew I meant no harm. After a mere two minutes of questioning, the guards determined that this grandma in tennis shoes was no terrorist and released me with the admonition to, "Go and trespass no more."</p>
	<p>Another harrowing incident occurred in Herculaneum. I was so busy photographing all the glorious sights, I somehow allowed my bag to slip off my shoulder. Not only was my credit card in there, so was a considerable sum of money and, most importantly, my memory card with about five hundred photos of Rome. After running wildly up and down the ruins without result, I reported my loss and gave my cell phone number to the guard office, then left for Naples.</p>
	<p>"Gee, Lynne, you're handling this well," my companions commented.</p>
	<p>"We gotta have faith; there are still good people in this world."</p>
	<p>But, in my secret heart, I was worried. I sat on a bench and lifted my head in prayer. Noticing the church of Saint Anthony across the piazza, I petitioned him to intercede. Twenty minutes later, I received a call&nbsp;&#160;...&#160;my bag had been found! A messenger delivered it to me that afternoon with all the items intact.</p>
	<p>The third incident took place in Sorrento. I have the language skills of a pigeon, so an Italian friend was to confirm my appointment with the archaeologist. It was essential that I meet with him the next day, as my window of opportunity was very tight. I stood on the Corso Tasso waiting for my translator so we could place the call. The archaeologist's office would be closing soon; time was running out. I toe-tapped, strutted and muttered and still my friend didn't show up.</p>
	<p>Across the street I saw a church dedicated to Saint Francis. Since prayer had already worked so nicely for me, again I prayed. Before I even got to the Amen, my friend came stomping across the cobblestones on her stilettos.</p>

	<p>So, now I was in Pompeii about to meet the professor. A little bit shaky and quite damp, I prayed one simple prayer, "Oh, God, please help me."</p>
	<p>Immediately, an indescribable peace wafted over me like a clean linen sheet. I felt cool, both in body and spirit. As I continued to stroll toward the Villa di Misteri, I had a physical sense of Saint Anthony behind me, Saint Peter in front and Saint Francis beside me.</p>
	<p>The interview went splendidly. Today my three amigos still walk with me wherever I go, putting in a good word to God whenever I need them.</p>
