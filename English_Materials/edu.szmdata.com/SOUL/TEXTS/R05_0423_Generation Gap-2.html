	<p>I'm five and my mom is everything. She smells good, she makes me great things to eat and she washes my "blankey." She dries my tears and cleans my skinned knee.</p>

	<p>I'm twelve and now she is embarrassing; how could she make me wear that dress?</p>
	<p>All the kids laughed at me. A tear slides down my face as she intones, "Don't be such a drama queen."</p>
	<p>I'm seventeen and all I can manage is an eyeball roll at her antiquated lectures. Tears flow in frustration&mdash;she just doesn't understand me!</p>
	<p>I'm twenty-one and she seems a little smarter now. I tell her that "things will be different with my kids; I will raise them right." Now she rolls her eyes at me with a slight smile playing across her face.</p>
	<p>I'm twenty-four and as I hear my daughter's first cry, tears of joy run down both my face and my mother's.</p>
	<p>I'm thirty and my daughter is six. "See Mom, how close my daughter and I are? I really think I understand you better now." There are tears in the corners of her eyes as she hugs me and whispers quietly in my ear, "Not yet honey, not yet."</p>
	<p>I'm thirty-seven and my fourteen-year-old daughter yells at me for emerging from the car when I pick her up at the dance. She yelled, "How embarrassing, Mom." As I cried out my hurt feelings to my mom, she says to me, "You're getting closer, dear."</p>

	<p>I'm forty and my seventeen-year-old knows all the answers and they seem to be eluding me. I cry because my mom is dying and I now realize her wisdom.</p>
	<p>I'm forty-five and my daughter is off to war. I cannot protect her, and she makes her own decisions now. And Mom, if you can hear me, "I think I caught up and I love you and I'm so sorry!" Tears of sorrow for missing her mix with tears of joy at having had her as my mother.</p>
	<p>My daughter calls from overseas. After an argument she tells me, "Things will be different; I will raise my children right!" Are my eyeballs rolling?</p>
	<p>I'm fifty and my daughter is expecting. It is a girl. As I hold my hand against her protruding belly the baby kicks. My daughter smiles and says, "I think I understand you better now, Mom."</p>
	<p>I smile and think, "You're getting closer, honey."</p>
