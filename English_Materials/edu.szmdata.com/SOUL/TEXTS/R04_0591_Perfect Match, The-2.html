<p class="storyAuthor">Marie Williams</p>
<p>Single again after eighteen years of marriage. Ugh! Basically, I'd been married my entire adult life. I got married at twenty-two, and I was now forty-one. How in the world does a woman in her forties date? Where would I even meet men? Pretty much everyone I knew was part of a couple. I wasn't in college anymore, which is where I had met my ex. I didn't want to do the bar scene. What to do? What to do?</p>
<p>A number of people told me I should try online dating. "It's just like shopping!" my girlfriend told me gleefully. "You just go on the website, browse through the photographs, and click on the one you want."</p>
<p>Well, that didn't seem too painful. Okay, I decided, I'll go for it. I figured I'd start with the site that I had heard the most about. A lot of people will be members. Might as well put the odds in my favor for meeting an eligible bachelor.</p>
<p>I signed up, answered all the questions, even wrote a little biography about myself. The only thing missing was a decent picture to post. I decided to have one of my friends take a digital photo of me. In the meantime, I went ahead and charged three months to my credit card and clicked "submit."</p>
<p>I signed on the next day, and to my delight had several e-mails waiting for me. Wow! And I had thought guys were so visual. I didn't even have a picture posted, but several guys were interested in me anyway. I replied to the e-mails, and a couple of days later finally had a picture taken to include in my profile. Once I uploaded my photograph, I decided to start my own search.</p>
<p>I kept it very generic. Didn't use the "advanced search;" just checked off the boxes for "female seeking male," "age range 35&ndash;45" (what can I say, I like younger guys) within "20 miles of my zip code." I clicked on "search" and sat back, anxiously waiting to see who the mighty match-making gods would fix me up with.</p>
<p>Take a wild guess. Who do you suppose turned up as the Number 1 match for me? Does the song "Escape" ring a bell with anyone? You know, the one about "If you like pi&ntilde;a coladas&nbsp;&#160;...&#160;" Yep&nbsp;&#160;...&#160;of course&mdash;my ex-husband was the number one man who the match-making gods thought would be my perfect match. What kind of sick game is this? I leapt from my desk chair and paced around the house, mumbling "This is so wrong. This is so very, very wrong!"</p>
<p>I wasn't jealous, which I was glad about. It just seemed so icky and weird. So, even though I'd paid for a three-month membership and had only been a member for a few days, I decided to cancel.</p>
<p>Here's the rub. Even though you cancel your membership, your profile is still available for others to see unless you request that your profile be hidden. Something I didn't realize until the next day when I received an e-mail from my ex. "Fancy meeting you here," he wrote. A modern-day twist I suppose on that classic '70s song.</p>
<p>But my version doesn't end up with the guy and the girl realizing that they were really meant for each other all along. Instead, I realized that sometimes the match-making gods simply get it wrong.</p>
