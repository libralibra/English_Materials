<p>I was pooped, plain and simple. A young mother, occupied with a household of four active little ones that I'd birthed in a six-year span, I felt my world close in on me one dreary Sunday afternoon.</p>
<p>"I just need to sleep," I whined to my husband. "Sleep will cure me. I crave it. I need it. I deserve it. I just want a nice, long&nbsp;&#160;...&#160;"</p>
<p>"Consider it done," he interjected.</p>
<p>"&#160;...&#160;uninterrupted nap."</p>
<p>His eyebrows darted upward as he glanced pointedly at the rain pounding on the patio. He gestured at our housebound children.</p>
<p>"Uninterrupted? Really?" He shook his head and gave a dry laugh. "With this crew, that's asking a lot."</p>
<p>If it hadn't been as tired as the rest of me, I'm sure my jaw would have clenched. Instead, I merely repeated myself, tossing the word a bit desperately over my shoulder as I scurried upstairs to bed.</p>
<p>"Uninterrupted. I want an UN-interrupted nap."</p>
<p>I fluffed my pillow, pulled a warm afghan to my chin, and curled into a ball. My eyes had barely drifted shut when I heard my redheaded toddler holler from the stairway.</p>
<p>"Mommy! Mommy!"</p>
<p>I pulled the afghan over my head.</p>
<p>"Mommy? Where are you?"</p>
<p>"I should've known this wouldn't work," I grouched to myself and heaved a sigh. But before I could toss back the covers and drag myself from bed, my husband manfully shouldered his mantle of responsibility.</p>
<p>"Pssst. Koy, come back down here," he half whispered, although he knew I couldn't possibly be asleep already. "Mommy's napping. If there's something you want, son, you need to ask Daddy instead. Okay?"</p>
<p>"Okay," said Koy, his two-year-old voice loud and agreeable.</p>
<p>Satisfied, I closed my eyes again.</p>
<p>"Well, then," my husband's voice rose as he prompted, a bit impatiently, "tell me what it is you want."</p>
<p>"Mommy," said Koy, plaintively. "I want my mommy."</p>
