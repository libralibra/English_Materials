	<p>Once upon a time, I had an amazing job. I went to work every day enthusiastic and eager to enjoy my job. Then I'd do it again the next day just as excited as the day before.</p>
	<p>This wonderful ride lasted about eight years. Then things changed. My dream job became a nightmare. Swinging-door leadership turned our once congenial and cooperative staff into disgruntled and disgusted employees. As for me, I was a walking pity party, inviting family and friends to listen to how miserable my job and life were. You can imagine how popular I was.</p>

	<p>About that time, something I considered insignificant happened. I had recently returned from an amazing six-week exchange trip to Mexico and presented a program to the local Rotary club that had sponsored me.</p>
	<p>My minister was in the audience that night. After the program, he came up to me and said, "Linda, I didn't know you could speak Spanish. You know our church sends a medical and construction team to Bolivia every year. We've never had anyone who could speak even a few sentences of Spanish. I'd like you to think about going with us this year."</p>
	<p>I knew about the trip&mdash;and I also knew the trip was rough, rugged and not my kind of travel. But, to be courteous, I told him I'd think about it.</p>
	<p>As he left, he said, "I'll check back with you."</p>
	<p>He did. At 8:15 the next morning, he was sitting in my office. He told me the plans for that year: staffing a medical clinic and working on a church in Colqueamaya, a poor village high in the Andes Mountains. He said, "We will float a river on a raft, walk to and from the job sites and sleep on straw mats. Maybe there'll be latrines and maybe not. It'll be exciting, and I know you'll enjoy it!"</p>
	<p>I listened politely, but on the inside, I was rolling my eyes and thinking, "No way." At that time, I was a sissy, prissy traveler. Camping and roughing it were for my husband and sons, avid campers and backpackers. I told my minister I would think about it.</p>
	<p>In spite of my travel misgivings, I began to consider going. The idea my minister had planted began to flourish. I thought, "I'll go on this trip so I can put some time and distance between me and my job. Maybe it will help me decide what to do."</p>
	<p>I decided to go on the trip for very selfish reasons. It would be a break from my job and unhappiness. I made a deal with myself: If things were better when I returned, I would know that I was the problem and I would have to leave the job.</p>
	<p>My husband and sons thought, "They'll life-flight her back on the first plane. She won't make it. She can't handle it."</p>
	<p>But I did make it. I surprised myself and amazed my family. I loved the experience!</p>
	<p>On the trip, we experienced all the adventures my minister had promised and more. I worked with people who lived in extreme poverty. Most were herders or subsistence farmers. They lived in adobe brick houses with thatched roofs, slept on hard-packed dirt floors with a few blankets for warmth, and often ate only one simple meal a day. In spite of all this, they were happy, even joyful, and lived as if they had no cares in the world.</p>

	<p>Their happiness puzzled and confused me. They had nothing and were happy. I had everything they didn't have, and I was miserable.</p>
	<p>I took a long, hard look at myself in the mirror. What I saw was not pretty. I asked myself, "What's wrong with this picture? What's wrong with you?"</p>
	<p>The truth was ugly. I was all about ego, status, money and show. My priorities were upside down. I had some serious thinking and changing to do.</p>
	<p>When I returned to my job, another surprise awaited me. Instead of the situation being better, it was much worse. I hadn't considered that possibility. My decision to leave the job was easy; the financial consequences were not. Fortunately, my husband was supportive, and we downsized before it became popular.</p>
	<p>I didn't have another full-time job for two years. My 4,000-mile detour to Bolivia had derailed me from the fast track and the road to fame and fortune. I had many moments to consider what I had learned on the detour.</p>
	<p>I realized that money is only a thing. People&mdash;family, friends and relationships&mdash;are more important than things. I learned that for me, a simple life is best. I am now blessed with less. My current job pays much less and has few perks&mdash;and I'm happy. Interestingly, the people around me are happier too!</p>
	<p>Another plus&mdash;I've learned to rough and tough it with the best&mdash;and I like it! I go back to Bolivia as frequently as I can for a refresher course on what's really important in life and for the right reasons.</p>
	<p>So, if you find yourself on a rough, rocky road in life, keep putting one foot in front of the other. Maybe you'll come to a detour like I did that will lead you to simple, happy experiences and adventures in your life.</p>
