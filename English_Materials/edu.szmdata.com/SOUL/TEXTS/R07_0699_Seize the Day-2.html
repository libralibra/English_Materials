<p>"We are food for worms, lads," declared Professor Keating, the unorthodox English teacher played by Robin Williams in the 1989 film <em>Dead Poets Society</em>. "Each and every one of us is one day going to stop breathing, turn cold, and die."</p>

<p>Those words, addressed to his pink-cheeked students, iced the blood in my veins when I watched the movie a few years back. Perhaps it was all in the timing. Only months earlier, I had survived the Big 5-0 and already the New Year was waving a greeting in the near distance. It seemed like the years were passing by while I simply clung to a kite tail. I felt staid, dissatisfied, unfulfilled. In short, I felt my own mortality.</p>

<p>This, perhaps, is why I scooted to the edge of my seat, transfixed and determined not to miss one profound word from the professor's mouth.</p>

<p>"Carpe diem, lads. Seize the day!" he preached to the literature class at the exclusive Welton Academy. "Make your lives extraordinary!"</p>

<p>Later in the movie, the teacher urged the boys to stand on his desk, as a reminder to look at the world in a different way because the universe was broader than their view of it. Everyone, I thought to myself, should have such a bohemian insurrectionary in their lives.</p>

<p>As I inhaled scene after moving scene, the rallying classroom cry, "Carpe diem!" sang in my ears like a mantra. I recognized the words from my four years of high school Latin class, only back then Mrs. Maag had taught the more literal translation of "carpe diem" &ndash; "pluck the day."</p>

<p>I liked that image better, I decided. Pluck the day.</p>

<p>Seize the moment. </p>

<p>Or, as Robert Herrick so poetically penned centuries ago, "Gather ye rosebuds while ye may."</p>

<p>Entranced, I sat as the last movie credits rolled down the screen, impulsively reevaluating my life and rethinking my annual goals.</p>

<p>To date, I had lived mostly from the detailed, itemized lists I created annually when the old year faded and the new one offered a fresh start. So dedicated was I to this system that I used to make separate goal lists for each of my four children, another for my husband, and even one for the dog. Why, I was known to make master lists that organized my battalion of lists! Now, however, I knew I needed to make a drastic change.</p>

<p>What would happen, I wondered, if I set aside my lists this next year and took Professor Keating's advice to "suck out all the marrow of life." Could I survive without daily, weekly, and monthly guides to order my hours? Could I still be productive? Reliable? Successful?</p>

<p>And, just that quickly, I resolved to give it a try.</p>

<p>I decided to embrace the unknown. I opted to live life with deliberation. I chose to make my life extraordinary.</p>

<p>But what, exactly, did that look like?</p>

<p>For me, it meant transcending the mundane in order to accept change. I discovered elasticity in me that I never knew existed. I learned to embrace serendipitous opportunities and to discover delight in the moment. Above all, this new outlook left me open to possibility.</p>

<p>Yes, I still dealt with the day-to-day reality of&nbsp;&#160;...&#160;oh&nbsp;&#160;...&#160;you know&nbsp;&#160;...&#160;the kinds of minutiae written on the lists that once consumed me. But those demands no longer determine my days. Instead, I'm open to chatty phone calls, a spontaneous lunch with a friend, and an evening walk with my husband. I'm freer to entertain, eager to extend an invitation to houseguests, and willing to organize a family reunion. I'm no longer reluctant to travel, to commit to a community project, to volunteer as an election judge.</p>

<p>Now, I focus less on my housework and more on enjoying my home. Instead of worrying about weight, I find pleasure in fresh food and homegrown vegetables. Rather than list all I need to do, I keep a gratitude journal of the new blessings I discover in each waking hour.</p>

<p>So, this New Year, as in the past few, I will make only a single resolution. A resolution I find satisfaction in writing and joy in keeping: Carpe diem!</p>
