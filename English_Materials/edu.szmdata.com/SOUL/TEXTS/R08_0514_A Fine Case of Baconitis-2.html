	<p>Pregnant with my first and only child, I did the typical things&mdash;threw up as soon as I got out of bed in the morning, threw up at lunch, and threw up when anything smelled stronger than a saltine cracker. One sunny Sunday morning before I knew I was expecting, I decided to cook bacon. Bad, bad move. By the time the bacon had crisped in the frying pan, I'd raced to the bathroom more than once.</p>

	<p>Please understand that I'm a bacon lover. My heart sings at the sound of bacon crackling in the hot grease of a frying pan and at the smell of the meat's smoky scent wafting through the house. It takes me back to Saturday morning breakfasts long ago, when life seemed to be a ribbon-bedecked gift, waiting to be opened.</p>

	<p>So, it's understandable that in my state of prenatal ignorance, I decided only one thing could cause me to feel that sick at the smell of bacon: an advanced disease. Something with a weird medical title, such as Second Stage Pork-inoma or Third Degree Baconitis.</p>

	<p>The morning following the bacon fiasco, I felt fine. Odd disease, that Third Degree Baconitis&mdash;one minute my stomach felt great, the next I was driving the porcelain bus. Being late for work, I didn't have time to ponder the oddity of the symptoms. However, I'd learned my lesson, and there would be no leftover bacon for me that morning. Instead, I grabbed a handful of grapes and an opened, now fizzless root beer. When I got to the workplace, where I developed film for a cancer research company, I topped off my breakfast with a custard doughnut that sat on a plate on the receptionist's desk&mdash;last week's leftover doughnut.</p>

	<p>It didn't take long before I lay curled up on the cold, linoleum floor in the darkroom, holding my nose with one hand to block the acrid scent of photo chemicals&mdash;a smell that only made the nausea worse&mdash;and rubbing my stomach with the other.</p>

	<p>"This Third Stage Baconitis is advancing rapidly," I muttered to myself through gritted teeth. "I have to make an appointment immediately to see a doctor." Then I jumped up and dashed to the bathroom.</p>

	<p>Several weeks later, the doctor confirmed it. No, not Third Stage Baconitis, but a three-month pregnancy. I walked out of her office elated. Now it all made sense. No disease, no treatments involving chemo or radiation, just six more months of waiting for a baby&mdash;a cute, sweet baby to fill our lives with joy.</p>

	<p>I was so happy I didn't even wait until we arrived back at our little nest to tell my husband. I told him in the car&hellip; and then we drove home faster than the wind so I could go throw up again.</p>
