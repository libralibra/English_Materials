<p>When my granddaughter Emily was five she was a go-getter who tried my patience to the limit. With big blue eyes the size of saucers and blond hair that looked like it was combed with an eggbeater, she was a whirlwind in motion. After one of her visits, I would head for the bottle of aspirin and fill the tub with hot water for a bubble bath, some medication and meditation.</p>
<p>During one particular visit, she was in rare form. She had twirled into a lamp and broken it, stuck her toe into the nightlight and burned it, and clogged the toilet by flushing a napkin down it, all in the course of twenty-four hours.</p>
<p>She was up at the crack of dawn the next morning and found my cosmetics. I was practically scared out of my wits when a small ghoulish form in full make-up crawled into bed with me. I was ready to scold her, but my heart melted when Emily said, "Nana, you always look so pretty. Would you teach me to wear make-up just like you do?"</p>
<p>I decided that day we would do a craft project together to keep Emily out of mischief and maybe this time we would bond a little. I sat at the kitchen table with scrapbooking tools of every description, papers in various hues of the rainbow and scissors that cut every which way. I was working hard at lining up letters on a page while Emily twirled around the room in circles.</p>
<p>"Emily, please sit down!" I practically yelled across the kitchen. "I'm getting a headache watching you."</p>
<p>"But, Nana, I love to see the colors in my skirt go round and round," she replied.</p>
<p>Pushing on my temples, I tried to will away the throb that was building behind my eyes.</p>
<p>"Emily, you're not helping Nana's headache," I cautioned.</p>
<p>"What's wrong, Nana? I'm just twirling. I'm not hurting anything."</p>
<p>Why did Emily drive me crazy? I had done fine with my own children but this granddaughter was getting on my nerves. I must be a terrible grandmother, I thought as I lay in bed that night listening to her hum to herself. Why couldn't she sit still? Where had I gone wrong? I was more determined than ever to make her visit a happy experience. Maybe we would form a connection. Living two hours away, I didn't get to see her as often as I would have liked.</p>
<p>The next morning I gave up on scrapbooking and let Emily play dress-up with my costume jewelry and old evening dresses. Heels, purses, boas and scarves kept her busy the rest of the afternoon. As I busied myself in the kitchen, I watched her out of the corner of my eye. She seemed to have more fun tramping around the room singing than trying to do a craft project with me. I felt like the worst grandma in the world.</p>
<p>That evening I called Emily's mom, Jennifer.</p>
<p>"Jen, I'm just doing terrible as a grandmother," I confessed.</p>
<p>"What makes you say that, Mom?"</p>
<p>"Well, I can't seem to relate to Emily. She's a bundle of energy and never sits still long enough for us to get to know one another," I said, practically in tears.</p>
<p>My daughter began to chuckle, "Mom, you don't get it, do you?"</p>
<p>"What?" I asked.</p>
<p>"She's you! You two are exactly alike&mdash;two peas in a pod."</p>
<p>"Me? You're kidding, right? I'm not like her."</p>
<p>"Yes, Mom, you! You're both bundles of energy. You both like glittery clothes, shiny jewelry, and are drama queens at heart. Give yourself a chance."</p>
<p>"A drama queen? Really!" I couldn't believe my ears.</p>
<p>I paused to think. Could it be? Was she right? She had made some good points. I had to admit it&mdash;maybe she was right on.</p>
<p>"You know, Jen, I just didn't see it. I may have been going about this all wrong. I have an idea that might work. We'll talk again tomorrow night," I said, gently hanging up the phone.</p>
<p>The next day I decided to try a different approach. I dragged out the Karaoke machine and Emily's eyes lit up. She loved to sing and dance, just as I had at her age. I remembered the feel of the conical toe shoes in ballet class and the sound of tap clicks on the wooden floor of the dance studio. I was never happier than when I was singing or dancing. I loved make-up and wearing bling.</p>
<p>"Emily, would you like it if Nana put on a show with you?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Oh goodie," she said, clapping her hands and jumping up and down.</p>
<p>We moved the furniture around and hung up a sheet in the entry hall. We used the tiled foyer as our stage. Then we proceeded to put on a wild floorshow, complete with improvised costumes, lots of beads and make-up. The afternoon flew by as we glided and stomped across the floor. Emily and I moved to the beat of the Stones, and giggled and hugged when we took our bows. It felt good to feel so young and alive again. Maybe I wasn't such a bad grandma after all.</p>
<p>"Can we do it again tomorrow, Nana?"</p>
<p>"Sure," I replied. I had found the magic key. That night in bed we cuddled and recollected our day. I got a big kiss goodnight and an extra long hug.</p>
<p>Emily and I got bolder as the week went on. We danced to Chubby Checker, Herman's Hermits, Buddy Holly, and did our own version of <em>Grease</em>. Emily didn't know where I got all the material, but little did she know her Nana was once a hoppin' and boppin' teenager.</p>
<p>Ten years have gone by and Emily has lived in Japan and Washington. Even though she is far away she sends me pictures of funky clothes she likes, via e-mail. I see her pictures on Facebook and I mail her glittery costume jewelry that I find.</p>
<p>Our love has evolved over time and we are now in sync. I can relate to her and I love her enthusiastic approach to life. What was once so annoying to me is now as refreshing as the baths I used to take when she left. Emily is a sophomore in high school and is moving back to our area this year. She now does performances in local theater and in her school's talent show. I can't wait to be there in person. I'll be the one cheering in the front row. I know when she bows she'll blow a special kiss just for me. We're two peas in a pod.</p>
