<p>"Great drive!" one of my girlfriends remarked.</p>
<p>"Your longest yet," said another.</p>
<p>"Thanks," I replied sheepishly, as I put the head cover on and gently placed the golf club in my bag.</p>
<p>"What did you use?" one of the girls asked.</p>
<p>"Oh, it's a club from the garage."</p>
<p>"Let's see it."</p>
<p>I pulled it out and tugged the cover off. The candy-apple red head glistened in the bright sun, the black shaft accentuated the brilliant color.</p>
<p>"But that's a seven wood."</p>
<p>"Yeah, you know I can't hit a driver. I lose control of the big head on the down swing."</p>
<p>"Well, you hit that club further than all of us off the tee. Good job."</p>
<p>Weeks went by and I hit the sweet spot on that seven wood each and every time. It felt great to finally get some good drives down the fairway. But I knew it wouldn't last.</p>
<p>"You're really hitting that club well. Where'd you get it?"</p>
<p>"Ummmm," I hedged, not wanting to reveal the truth.</p>
<p>"Well, where did you buy it?"</p>
<p>"I didn't. It's my husband's club. And he doesn't know I have it."</p>
<p>"You didn't ask him if you could borrow it?"</p>
<p>"Nope, and if he finds out, I'm dead. He made the mistake of letting me use it once when we were playing together. I'd flubbed a shot off the tee so he handed me the seven wood and said, 'Here, try this.' So I did, and fell in love."</p>
<p>"So why can't you tell him you're using it?"</p>
<p>"When I asked him if I could borrow it he said no, it's a man's club with a graphite extra stiff shaft or something." I smiled, then added, "He probably thinks I'd wreck it."</p>
<p>My girlfriend started to laugh, then said, "So what are you doing&mdash;sneaking it out of his bag?" She glanced at me sideways.</p>
<p>I looked at her. "He plays with the guys on Saturdays, and I play with you girls on Wednesdays. I pull it out of his bag after he leaves for work and I put it back as soon as I get home."</p>
<p>"And he can't tell that you've used it?"</p>
<p>"Not yet."</p>
<p>We finished that hole and went up to the next. I stuck the tee in the hard ground, placed my ball on top and adjusted my stance. Then I took careful aim with what I now called "my sneaky seven wood," then let the ball fly. It went quite a way, resting in the middle of the fairway with a great approach to the green. I began to walk back to the cart and flipped up the club to look at the bright red head. That's when I noticed a nick, probably from the wooden tee.</p>
<p>"Oh, man, look at that," I said to my girlfriend.</p>
<p>"You'd better polish that out," she replied.</p>
<p>Scrubbing the head and face of the club when I got home from a golf game became a weekly ritual. I tried different polishes to bring the luster back and to remove the scratches. I knew my husband only used it in the fairway, and scratches from a wooden tee would raise an eyebrow or two. He was sure to suspect something if it looked used.</p>
<p>Months later, even though I was keeping the club polished, guilt got the better of me. I wanted to tell him, but I didn't want to give up what was now my favorite club. "Honey," I said one afternoon, "remember when you let me use your seven wood off the tee? I want to get one of my own, just like it."</p>
<p>"That's a man's club, made for a man. It's not right for you."</p>
<p>Stiff shaft or not, it was perfect for me, but I couldn't tell him I'd been hitting with it for almost a year. "So where did you buy it?"</p>
<p>"I got it from a friend of mine who designed it specifically for me and my swing. It's one of a kind."</p>
<p>Later, I dug out the receipt and called his friend. He agreed to make a club for me, with the exact same specs as the one he made for my husband. And he agreed to keep it a secret.</p>
<p>A few weeks later, I picked it up. Candy-apple red head, black shaft&mdash;a gorgeous club, just like the other one. That Wednesday I met the girls at the course.</p>
<p>"Guess what? I got a seven wood of my very own!" I shouted.</p>
<p>"But will you hit it as well?" they said. "We think you liked that club just because it was forbidden."</p>
<p>"You might be right. Let's see how this new one works today." I pulled out my brand new club and approached the tee. Just like before, I hit the sweet spot and sent the ball sailing through the air. "Magic!" I shouted.</p>
<p>"Well, you've got the number with that club. No need for you to ever get a driver. You hit that thing farther than all of us."</p>
<p>Did I ever tell my husband I used his club for almost a year? Nope. Some things a woman just has to keep a secret. And that sweet, candy-apple red club is one of mine.</p>
