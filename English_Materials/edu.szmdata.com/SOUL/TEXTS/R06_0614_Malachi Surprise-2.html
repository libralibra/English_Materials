</div>
<p>I received the notice in the mail from the bank. Make at least one mortgage payment by the next Monday or foreclosure proceedings would be initiated.</p>
<p>I had no idea what to do. My wife, Joan, had recently quit her job as a registered nurse to be a stay-at-home mother to our two young sons, Michael and Daniel. We had met with our pastor and he reaffirmed our decision for Joan to concentrate on raising the boys.</p>
<p>"There may be financial problems, but the Lord will provide," he had said. "Taking care of children is not a hassle, as some parents seem to think. It is a ministry to the Lord."</p>
<p>I had a good job, but not an executive position. It was during the late 1970s, and the economy was a mess. Double-digit inflation; double-digit interest rates; long lines to purchase gasoline.</p>
<p>I did not earn enough money from my salary to support a family of four.</p>
<p>All that week, I grappled with the problem. It burrowed into my mind like a mole. "You made a big mistake. You are going to lose your home."</p>
<p>I spent most of my time worrying. I knew the Bible advised: "Be anxious about nothing." But no matter how hard I tried to climb the hill of faith, I kept slipping back into the mire of apprehension.</p>
<p>The situation seemed hopeless. I could not come up with the money or even a clue of how to get it. Within a few days, legal action would be initiated that would take away my family's home.</p>
<p>Friday was payday, but most of that money had to be committed to necessities such as food for my family. The rest did not constitute nearly enough to make a mortgage payment.</p>
<p>I told no one, not the pastor, not the associate pastor, nor anyone else at the church, about the financial plight of my family as I struggled with a new problem. As a Bible-believing Christian, I felt it was my duty to God to contribute a tithe of my income to His church. But suppose I skipped a week? I could make up for it some other time. If I kept the tithe money in my wallet, I'd be that much closer to being able to make the mortgage payment.</p>
<p>I turned in my Bible to the book of Malachi and read: "Bring the whole tithe into the storehouse, that there may be food in my house. Test me in this," says the Lord Almighty, "and see if I will not throw open the floodgates of heaven and pour out so much blessing that you will not have room enough for it."</p>
<p>My decision was made. On Sunday morning, I placed my tithe check in the offering plate.</p>
<p>Then I went right back to worrying. I worried through the rest of the morning. I worried all afternoon. In the evening, Joan and I returned for another church service and I managed to worry all the way through it.</p>
<p>After the evening service, the associate pastor came up to me with a smile on his face and handed me an envelope. "The Lord told me to give this to you," he said, then turned and walked away.</p>
<p>In the envelope was a check for precisely the amount needed for the mortgage payment.</p>
<p>I don't know how the associate pastor became informed of my problem, or how he decided he should do something about it. But I do know this: I tithed and God kept His promise by pouring out a blessing.</p>
<p>From that Sunday thirty years ago, to the present time, my family has not encountered serious financial difficulties of any kind.</p>
