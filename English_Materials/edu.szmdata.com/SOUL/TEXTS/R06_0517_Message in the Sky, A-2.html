<p class="quotes">The LORD is close to the brokenhearted and saves those who are crushed in spirit.</p>
<p class="quote_author">&mdash;Psalm 34:18</p>
</div>
<p>One evening, feeling anxious and longing for solitude, I stepped out into a quiet October night and walked to the towering pine in my front yard. Slumping down onto the cool ground, I pulled my legs close for warmth. Overhead, the sky stretched wide like a dark blanket as sounds of the night swirled around me.</p>
<p>The past few months had been filled with unspeakable sadness. At forty-seven, my sister found herself facing an unwanted divorce, ending a marriage of twenty-six years&mdash;a marriage nobody ever expected to end, and for reasons that could only be described as heartbreaking.</p>
<p>Since hearing the news, not a day had gone by that I didn't find myself overcome with grief. I pleaded with God to change hearts and minds, but it appeared the heavens were brass.</p>
<p>I'm not sure what I expected on this particular night, but an urgency consumed me as I sat there. I needed an answer. I had to know that God was still out there listening.</p>
<p>"Where are you, Lord?" I said, my words coming out in desperate sobs. "I need to know that you are with me in all of this turmoil and grief. I need to know that you hear me. Can you hear me, God? I need to know!"</p>
<p>My frantic plea floated across the lawn and faded into the night. I waited, anxious for a sign. A bird singing. A wind chime catching the breeze. Something indicating that God had heard me.</p>
<p>But there was only silence of the deepest kind.</p>
<p>With a heavy heart, I leaned back against the trunk of the pine and closed my eyes, letting the tears fall. I don't remember how long I sat there, but I will never forget what happened next.</p>
<p>When I opened my eyes, there, suspended in the blue heavens directly in front of me, framed perfectly between the branches of a neighbor's tree, was what appeared to be the biggest diamond I had ever seen.</p>
<p>An enthusiastic observer of the heavenly bodies, I knew immediately that it was the magnificent Venus. Though it's often called the morning and evening "star," Venus is not a star at all. Venus is a planet&mdash;the most brilliant planet in the solar system, so brilliant it can often be seen in daylight hours.</p>
<p>Had I been sitting two inches to the left or to the right, I would have missed this sight altogether. But there it was&mdash;Venus, flickering in a stunning display of colors. Its light entered my grief and took my breath away.</p>
<p>I knew it was God's gift to me&mdash;the sign I had longed for&mdash;because, for the first time in a long time, I felt Him there, filling the vast space around me. And I sensed that He was reassuring one of his despondent children: I am here, dear child. Morning and evening, I will always be here.</p>
