	<p>I picked a bad time to become a minimalist. My daughter had just moved home from college with armloads of clothing and boxes of electronic gadgets. She planned to live at home for a few months before her wedding.</p>

	<p>On move-back day, she struggled to carry the box we had purchased four years earlier for under-bed storage.</p>
	<p>"Don't you want to leave that in the garage?" I asked.</p>
	<p>"No, these are my shoes," she answered.</p>
	<p>My recent vow to clear my house of unnecessary stuff was quickly buried in piles of college T-shirts, mismatched kitchenware and boxes labeled "Italian flashcards."</p>
	<p>I was living in a feng shui nightmare!</p>
	<p>I decided to declutter after spending a summer week living in a Vermont college dormitory room while I attended a conference. A college dormitory without students is a blank canvas&mdash;no posters, no carpet, empty shelves and gaping closets. In my small white room with no television, no computer, no telephone and no distractions, I slept better than I had in months.</p>
	<p>Inspired, I returned home and cleared bookcases, boxed photographs and cleaned closets. And then Emily returned home to plan her wedding.</p>
	<p>The capable, organized daughter who had navigated college with skill now left a trail of destruction in her wake&mdash;soggy tea bags, empty snack packages, straws, lists, junk mail.</p>
	<p>Had I forgotten? Was she always like this, or had I become one of those cranky women who would rather dust than rock her babies? In high school Emily had left a trail of burning lights. I could follow her path around the house by snapping off lamp switches. But I didn't remember being bothered by her trails of clutter.</p>
	<p>Before Emily moved home, I had imagined that the three months before the wedding would be girl time when we could watch movies, shop and talk. I didn't anticipate turning into Clutter Cop&mdash;constantly chiding her about her housekeeping and depositing her bits of trash in the doorway of her room, where they stayed&nbsp;&#160;...&#160;unnoticed.</p>
	<p>I had once considered myself to be quite flexible and easygoing about messes. When my three kids were younger a neighbor asked, "Just how many kids do you have?" There were so many children in the yard, he could not figure out which belonged to me.</p>
	<p>I never minded when my kids finger-painted, shook thousands of sprinkles on homemade cookies, or dyed Easter eggs. A few splatters of paint on the wall or colored sugar in the kitchen corners was a small price to pay for creativity and family traditions. But that was before my children left for college and I became enamored with simplicity and order.</p>

	<p>When Emily moved home, I realized that the problem with being a minimalist was that it didn't leave room for the clutter of family life. Where does a minimalist put a four-foot-tall stack of bridal magazines with color-coded tabs? Rolls of ribbon to tie on tiny vials of bubbles? Or a note that says, "Mom, sorry about the mess, I'll pick it up when I get home. I love you."</p>
	<p>A minimalist can get quite grumpy when her children move home. That's why I decided to postpone becoming a minimalist. Because if I didn't, I was afraid I would find myself in that small, white room again, but this time there would be padding on the walls.</p>
