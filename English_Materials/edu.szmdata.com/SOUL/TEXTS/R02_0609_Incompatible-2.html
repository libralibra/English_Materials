<p>It's 3 a.m. and I'm lying in bed beside him thinking how totally incompatible we are. We went to a brilliant play this afternoon&mdash;<em>Brief Encounter</em>&mdash;with some of the most creative staging I've ever seen, and he thought it was "boring." And we came home and watched a gripping <em>Brothers and Sisters</em> episode on television, and at every commercial he switched to the Knicks game. How could he not be able to sit through one of my TV shows once a week without interrupting it with bits and pieces of a basketball game? What ever made me think we were suited to each other?</p>
<p>A song begins to run through my mind&#160;...&#160;"Incompatible&#160;...&#160;that's what you are; Incompatible&#160;...&#160;though near or far&#160;...&#160;" What was that song and who sang it? It suits us to a "T."</p>
<p>"Are you awake?" he asks.</p>
<p>"Yes, and I'm trying to think of a song that goes tum de dum de dum, that's what you are&#160;...&#160;"</p>
<p>"What time is it?" he asks groggily.</p>
<p>"Three a.m. and what is the song that goes tum de dum de dum&#160;...&#160;that's what you are? It was sung by a famous black singer&#160;...&#160;I can't think of his name."</p>
<p>"Are you trying to think of his name or the song?" he says, beginning to come awake.</p>
<p>"Both. Tum de dum de dum. His daughter sang it with him after he was dead."</p>
<p>"Um, yes. I've got it. Cole Porter."</p>
<p>"Cole Porter was not a black singer and his daughter didn't sing with him when he was dead."</p>
<p>"How could she sing with him if he was dead?"</p>
<p>"Never mind that. She just did. All right. I'll tell you the words and they apply to you. Incompatible&#160;...&#160;that's what you are&#160;...&#160;"</p>
<p>"You're lying there in the middle of the night and singing a Cole Porter song that says I'm incompatible?"</p>
<p>"It's not a Cole Porter song&#160;...&#160;it's this famous black singer&#160;...&#160;"</p>
<p>"Should we get up and look it up on the Internet?"</p>
<p>"At three o'clock in the morning you want to get on the Internet? Yes, I think we should."</p>
<p>We get out of bed and feel our way into our office, each going to our own computers.</p>
<p>"How do you look up tum de dum de dum?" he asks.</p>
<p>"No, look up famous black singer."</p>
<p>"I think his name is Cole something."</p>
<p>"He's not named Cole. Whose daughter sang with him after he was dead? Look up that! And then look up the name of the song&#160;...&#160;"Incompatible&#160;...&#160;that's what you are!" I sing it again for him. "I will go crazy if I don't think of the name of the song and the singer."</p>
<p>"Are you sure it's not "Uncompatible&#160;...&#160;that's what you are?"</p>
<p>"It's IN&#160;...&#160;" I scream. "In-compatible!"</p>
<p>"Is it Nat King Cole?"</p>
<p>"Yes, that's it. That's it! That's it!"</p>
<p>"And his daughter Natalie?"</p>
<p>"Oh, yes, yes. Thank God, that's it!"</p>
<p>"And was the song 'Unforgettable&#160;...&#160;That's what you are?'"</p>
<p>"You've got it! You've got it. You're wonderful. Amazing!"</p>
<p>"And not 'Un-compatible?'" He leaned across to my computer and kissed me.</p>
<p>"In-compatible. No, you're incredible."</p>
<p>He sings, "It's three o'clock in the morning. Can we go to bed now?"</p>
<p>I follow him back to the bedroom and I curl around him, spoon style.</p>
<p>"Am I still incompatible?" he whispers.</p>
<p>I think for a minute. Who else would get up at three o'clock in the morning and look up a black singer whose daughter sang with him after he was dead?</p>
<p>"No, you're unforgettable! Go to sleep."</p>
