	<p>I promised my daughter that she could do my make-up on Saturday night. My husband and I were going to a party, a casual affair, outdoors, and I thought, why not? My girl would love this chance to play with all the goodies in my make-up drawer, and I could always re-do any collateral damage in the car.</p>

	<p>I was ill-prepared for the grandness of the event at hand. Not the party&nbsp;&#160;...&#160;the makeover. When I came upstairs to dress, she had arranged all of her tools and color choices on the counter. Brushes, shadows, blushes, liners, concealers and powders, all artfully displayed in my bathroom.</p>
	<p>"Ready, Mom?"</p>
	<p>"I'm dressing first, and then I'll be ready for make-up, Abigail."</p>
	<p>"I'm not so sure about that black shirt," she says, eying me.</p>
	<p>I take a deep breath.</p>
	<p>"I think it's good with the rest of the outfit, Abby."</p>
	<p>She gives me a look filled with doubt. She is ten.</p>
	<p>"Mom, I'm just saying&nbsp;&#160;...&#160;long sleeves?"</p>
	<p>"Yes," I answer, realizing suddenly that I have stepped into an episode of "What Not to Wear, The Tween Years."</p>
	<p>The make-up portion of the evening is sounding better and better, so I finish dressing and approach the bathroom.</p>
	<p>I begin to moisturize, and she watches.</p>
	<p>"What kind do you use?" she asks. I tell her, and take the moment to talk about sunscreen.</p>
	<p>"Good point," she says.</p>
	<p>She reaches for the blush, and I stop her, needing to first blend in a mineral foundation. She watches, entranced.</p>
	<p>"Oh, shoot!" I exclaim. "I forgot my eye cream."</p>
	<p>"What's eye cream for?" Abby asks.</p>
	<p>"Dark circles."</p>
	<p>"Yeah, you're gonna want that."</p>
	<p>I feel my lips twitch with unspoken words, but she is right.</p>
	<p>I blend in the under-eye cream, and then it is her turn. She begins with my eyes, showing me her color choices, seeming shocked that I don't question her decisions. There is no need; she is right about everything. The browns, the golds, the colors to highlight my best features and conceal the imperfections. There is even a little extra sparkle for nighttime. She holds my face in her hands and uses a light touch. It takes a while, and I am in no hurry. I let her apply my eyeliner, my mascara, and then powder, lipstick, and blush.</p>
	<p>"I want to use a darker blush, Mom. I think it will be pretty."</p>
	<p>I okay the decision, and when I look in the mirror, it is her face I see first, next to mine, waiting for a reaction. For a moment, I am stunned by the job she has done. My make-up is soft, it is luminous&mdash;it is exactly the way I would want to look for this particular night.</p>
	<p>"Abby, you did such a good job. A really, really good job. I'm beautiful."</p>
	<p>"Do you think so?"</p>
	<p>Do I think so? That's a huge question. How often do I feel it? Like many women, perhaps rarely. And say it out loud? Perhaps never. But she had created on me (and in me) such a difference, that it was easy to give in to the moment. I was beautiful, by her hand, and she had given me this unexpected gift. This beauty. This beautiful moment.</p>
	<p>I add the cardigan to the black T-shirt. I'm not sure if she is impressed and I find myself actually wanting her opinion, but it is late, and I need to leave.</p>

	<p>"You need more gloss," she says.</p>
	<p>I stop in the doorway of the bedroom and allow her to touch up my lips.</p>
	<p>"There," she says, satisfied.</p>
	<p>"Thank you," I say, meaning it.</p>
	<p>"You're welcome." She is beaming.</p>
	<p>How is it that I feel like a movie star but it is Abby's face that is shining, with no make-up at all?</p>
	<p>Hers is true beauty glowing from within&nbsp;&#160;...&#160;no compacts, no glosses, no tubes. And if I could bottle up that beautiful feeling, that beautiful moment, that beautiful girl, I would. And on a day that is bound to come, a day when she questions her own beauty, I would open that bottle and give back to her this beautiful gift that she has so freely given to me.</p>
