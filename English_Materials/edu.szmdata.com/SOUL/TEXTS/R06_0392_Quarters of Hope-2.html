<div class="quotations">
	<p class="quotes">A wise lover values not so much the gift of the lover as the love of the giver.</p>
	<p class="quote_author">&mdash;Thomas &aacute; Kempis</p>
</div>	

	<p>My daughters, Hope and Hannah, have been blessed with many things: loving parents, keen intellect, great humor, athletic abilities, and beauty&nbsp;&#160;...&#160;inwardly and outwardly. My home is full of ribbons, medals, certificates, and various other awards they have accumulated over the years.</p>

	<p>But the one thing they have never had in abundance is money.</p>

	<p>In fact, with parents who work as ministers, they will never get a lot of money from home. They have worn hand-me-downs, thrift store clothing and have done without many things because of our low income. They never complained, never cried out for something we could not afford. In fact, I think they are more appreciative and well rounded because their feelings of worth do not come from external things.</p>

	<p>When my older daughter Hope was five years old she was looking for a gift to give me for Christmas. Not having any money of her own, Hope went to different neighbors and asked if she could do odd jobs to make some money. I don't know how she did it, but that Christmas she gave me a gift I will never forget.</p>

	<p>Because money was so tight, I had not been able to subscribe to the newspaper. Reading a newspaper is one of my pleasures, and I would gather one at doctors' offices or anywhere else a free one might be found.</p>

	<p>Hope knew this as we often read these freebies together. Thus, her gift.</p>

	<p>It was wrapped tightly in bright festive paper and taped together with several layers of clear tape.</p>

	<p>Small enough to be held in the palm of my hand, I questioned the contents of this precious gift.</p>

	<p>Hope laughed, "You'll love it!"</p>

	<p>Inside were two quarters.</p>

	<p>"It's for a newspaper," she said. "We can go get one fresh out of the machine!" I held those precious quarters in my hand and knew then that I was a vey rich woman.</p>

	<p>That was many years ago. Hope is in college now. When she left for college, I gave her a jar of quarters, a reminder that her love was priceless to me. It was a reminder that love costs nothing, but means everything to a mother and her daughter.</p>
