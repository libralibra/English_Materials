	<p>It had been five years since the younger of our two daughters left home. Both moved to southern California, while we lived in Phoenix a good five-hour drive away.</p>
	<p>Doug and I were actually enjoying an empty nest. The house stayed clean longer, we ate out more often, and we didn't have that constant sense of worrying that comes with parenting.</p>

	<p>When Chris called to say she was coming to Phoenix on Friday for a business meeting, I was thrilled.</p>
	<p>"I'll be there Labor Day weekend, Mom."</p>
	<p>In a nanosecond, I had the entire weekend planned out. I'll take her to that cute Italian restaurant, I thought. And she's never seen the new mall. Oh, and she'll love just being home and relaxing on the couch. We'll make memories.</p>
	<p>Chris's business meeting was over early on Friday, and the three of us hung out at the house having a great time. At dinner, she shared stories about her job and we laughed about silly, goofy things only families with wonderful memories understand.</p>
	<p>And then she said it. Casually. Without any hesitation. As though words couldn't possibly sting.</p>
	<p>"Some of my church friends are having a holiday get-together," she mentioned. "If it's okay with you guys, I think I'd like to go home tomorrow."</p>
	<p>Home? Tomorrow?</p>
	<p>The room sank into grayness, and my thoughts spun like the giant wheel on a TV game show. The kind where the contestant either wins an exciting prize or lands on the wrong slot&mdash;and goes bankrupt.</p>
	<p>She wants to go home tomorrow. Isn't this home?</p>
	<p>My feeling-wheel kept spinning in a rush of unexpected emotions. I had no idea where it was going to land.</p>
	<p>My first instinct was to stop at the slot marked "Angry: How could you grow up and leave me?" I could halt the spinning right there and be content in my anger.</p>
	<p>Chris stared at me. Could she see the spinning wheel, too?</p>
	<p>It kept turning, to pause on "Hurt: I've worked hard to make this your home."</p>
	<p>Keep going, keep going, my inner audience urged. "Attitude: I'm gonna clam up and punish you for ruining the wonderful, weekend plans I had for us."</p>
	<p>The wheel kept going. I didn't feel in control of it and feared this wonderful evening could dissolve into a bad memory, if it landed in the wrong spot.</p>
	<p>"Pity: I've gotten old and there is no more purpose for my life."</p>
	<p>"Detach: Act like you don't care."</p>
	<p>"Guilt: No explanation needed here&nbsp;&#160;...&#160;"</p>

	<p>Chris waited for a response.</p>
	<p>And as I gazed at her through a maze of confusion, I saw this beautiful young woman. A person of faith, value, and integrity. Hard-working, funny, and likable. I was privileged to be her mom.</p>
	<p>And her life was in southern California.</p>
	<p>I felt the wheel slow down. I had control of it, after all, and searched for the one slot that had been blurred by the others. The one marked "Acceptance: It will be okay, let her go, she still loves you."</p>
	<p>Easy? No.Worth it? Absolutely.</p>
	<p>Chris and I spent the rest of Friday evening eating too much ice cream and sharing too much gossip. Me and my beautiful daughter, my friend, creating a new memory. In fact, Chris had so much fun&mdash;she stayed until Sunday.</p>
	<p>I had won the prize, after all.</p>
