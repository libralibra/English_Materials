	<p class="quotes">Let me close as I did in Gander on September 11, 2002 when I went to that community to thank the people of Gander and the people of Canada for the overwhelming support and help that was given to us in the wake of those attacks on September 11, 2001.</p>

	<p>Four Corvettes. Four couples. Four weeks. We were going on a road trip with our friends; each of the four couples would be driving a Corvette and we would be away for four weeks. The planning for our adventure took about six months. It takes a lot of planning and coordination to get dates that work for eight people, figure out what everyone wants to see, plan a route, reserve the hotels and pack. Packing for four weeks in a Corvette's tiny luggage space takes lots of creativity. You wind up wearing the same outfits more than a few times. It's a good thing that we were all such good friends! Our strategy was to make everything fit in the car and still leave room for shopping along the way.</p>

	<p>Finally it was time to leave. We all lived in California, so our route took us east and north through Montana and then into Canada. We tried to stay off the major highways so that we could see as much of the beautiful, natural scenery as possible. We crossed over the border into Canada after driving through Glacier National Park. The border crossing was a small kiosk on a lovely two-lane country road. There were no buildings or people to be seen&mdash;just open road for as far as you could see. There was one person stationed in the kiosk&mdash;how lonely for him! We slowed down, preparing to stop but he just tipped his hat to us and waved us on&nbsp;&#160;...&#160;right into Canada. We didn't even have to stop. Now I must say we were pretty spiffy looking&mdash;four Corvettes of various colors, all in a row. I think he was impressed.</p>
	<p>We were impressed. Canada is beautiful. Our first few nights were spent in Calgary. And then it was on to the Banff Springs Hotel for some time in the Banff National Forest. What an amazing place. Driving through the Canadian Rockies was so breathtakingly beautiful. On our last night at the hotel we had a fabulous dinner in the main dining room and then sat in the immense lobby talking with our friends. We felt as if we were in a fairy tale. We never wanted it to end.</p>
	<p>But end it did. Abruptly. The next morning was September 11, 2001. We awoke to the news of the terrorist attacks on our country. This nightmare just couldn't be happening. But it was. We met our friends in the hotel restaurant for coffee. No one felt like eating anything. There were groups of people gathered around television sets and radios, watching and listening as the horror unfolded. Everyone was in shock. The disbelief on the faces of the people told the whole story. No one knew what to do&nbsp;&#160;...&#160;or what to say.</p>
	<p>We were in a foreign country and all we wanted to do was go home. We wanted to be with our families. We wanted to hug our kids. But we couldn't go home. The borders were closed. No one could cross. Thank goodness for cell phones! At this point we were just midway through our trip. Even though we still had plans to be in Canada for a while longer, it was weird knowing that we couldn't go home if we wanted to. It was a scary, spooky feeling. And we were to be on the road again. We were moving on to Lake Louise.</p>
	<p>Our somber group of caravaners hit the road. When we pulled up to Chateau Lake Louise we were again in awe of the beautiful surroundings&mdash;both the natural beauty around us and the beauty of the hotel itself. But the thing that impressed us the most was the wonderful Canadian people. Our four Corvettes did attract attention. And our cars had California license plates that made it pretty obvious we were visitors from the United States. Strangers&mdash;hotel guests and employees alike&mdash;came over to us to offer us their condolences on the tragedy that had happened in our country. Strangers became friends. Without exception, people asked us if there was anything that they could do for us. They assured us that our two countries were united&mdash;that the border between us was just an imaginary line. And I'll never forget this. There were two flags flying at the hotel overlooking beautiful Lake Louise&mdash;the Canadian flag and the flag of the United States of America. Both were flying side by side&mdash;at half-staff. It brought tears to my eyes.</p>
	<p>At dinner that night, people in the restaurant were quiet and subdued. No music played. Word had gotten around that the table of eight over in the corner of the room was a table of people from California. People kept coming over to comfort us and to console us. Was there anything that they could do for us? Did we need anything? In times of tragedy, the true goodness and kindness of people comes forth. It certainly did for us at that time.</p>
	<p>And the warmth and friendliness of the Canadian people continued as we travelled on down the road. From Lake Louise to Jasper to Whistler to Victoria, the story was the same. The towns were different but the people were the same. They reached out to us to offer a kind word and a hug. We were completely impressed by the physical beauty of Canada and by the warmth, hospitality and generosity of the Canadian people.</p>
	<p>When it was time to go home, the borders between our two countries were once again open. We were to board the ferryboat in Victoria and return to U.S. soil in Washington.</p>
	<p>This time our border crossing was quite different. Because of the attacks, the security was tight&mdash;to say the least. We were required to arrive at the loading area three hours early. Each car that was going onto the ferry was searched completely; each piece of luggage and its contents were checked thoroughly. Mirrors were used to check underneath all cars. Passports were checked and rechecked. Once you and your car had been cleared you couldn't leave the locked yard. Not for any reason. But all Canadian security personnel were polite and professional. They made a difficult situation as easy as possible for us.</p>

	<p>Finally we were allowed to drive our cars onto the ferry for the crossing. We arrived at Port Angeles, Washington. We were back in the United States. Disembarking was just as difficult as embarking. You couldn't just drive off the ferry. Cars and luggage were checked again, passports were checked again, people were questioned again. Security personnel even had bomb-sniffing dogs checking around each and every car. Difficult, yes&mdash;but we were home!</p>
	<p>We will never forget Canada. It is such a beautiful country. And we will never, ever forget the Canadian people. How wonderful they were. They taught us a lesson during the time we were there. We all need to reach out to others with kindness and compassion. It really does help and comfort during tough times and it really does make a difference. Thank you, Canadian people. We really appreciate you. We are making plans to come back soon and explore more of your wonderful country. You'll know it's us. We'll be the four couples driving those four Corvettes of various colors, all in a row. Don't forget to wave when you see us!</p>
