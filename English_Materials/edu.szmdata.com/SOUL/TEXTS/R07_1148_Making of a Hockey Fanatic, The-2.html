<p>If someone had told me ten years ago that I would become a hockey fanatic, I would have told them they were crazy. And if someone had told me that I would find myself standing outside of the Detroit Red Wings locker room shaking hands with Drew Miller, I would have told them they had lost their mind! But, both things did in fact happen.</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong&mdash;I love sports, but hockey had been nowhere near the top of my list. I grew up watching football, baseball and auto racing with my dad. He didn't like hockey because he didn't like "all the fighting." So I formed the impression early on that hockey was a divisive sport and not worth my time. That all changed when I met my would-be husband Andy.</p>
<p>Andy loved sports, Andy loved hockey, and despite living in Pennsylvania, Andy loved the Detroit Red Wings. As his new girlfriend, it was my duty to show an interest in the things that he liked. On Halloween night in 2001, Andy took me to see a minor league hockey game. The Grand Rapids Griffins&mdash;the Red Wings' minor league team&mdash;came to town to play against our local team, the Hershey Bears. I was open to the idea of trying something new, and I must say that it was quite exciting. I don't remember much about the game, but the highlight for me was watching Andy as he joyfully taunted the Bears' players who served time in the penalty box. Hockey was proving to be pretty fascinating after all, and I think I scored a few points with Andy that night!</p>
<p>Andy's passion for hockey continued and so did our courtship. We were married in 2003. With marriage came change&mdash;the birth of our daughter, moving (a few times), and new jobs for each of us. But hockey was still ever present in our lives. I enjoyed sitting and watching the Wings' games on television with Andy. It was a chance for us to unwind and spend some time together at the end of a long day. I learned more about the game and the players, and Andy could tell that I was really starting to enjoy it, almost as much as he did.</p>
<p>In 2009, we went to our first Red Wings game in Columbus. Andy was all decked out in layers, sporting a Red Wings hat, T-shirt, sweatshirt and Datsyuk jersey. The game against the Blue Jackets was great (Wings won!) and I found myself cheering, screaming and jumping out of my seat with Andy and the rest of the fans. I could feel the excitement in the air. It was as though the arena had come to life, and so had I. Was this really happening? Had I become a genuine hockey fan?</p>
<p>It was clear to me that my interest in hockey was no longer about impressing Andy&mdash;I was hooked! Almost immediately after the game, Andy and I began scheming about our next hockey game. But this time, we had to go to Detroit, to Joe Louis Arena. We knew there would be nothing like watching a Wings home game at the Joe. We planned our trip to Detroit for the following February to celebrate our anniversary. Andy wore the usual layers, but this time with a Franzen jersey. I had not yet committed to a favorite player, and I decided it was time to choose. I didn't want to choose a popular and well-established player. I've always favored the underdog, the new guy.</p>
<p>The Wings hosted the Buffalo Sabres and their star goalie Ryan Miller. Andy mentioned that the Wings had signed his younger brother Drew earlier in the season. In the program for the game, there happened to be an article about Drew Miller. It talked about his time at Michigan State, his disappointing start in the NHL, and his desire to contribute to the success of the Red Wings. I told Andy, "That's him&mdash;that's the guy!" And so I found myself even more connected to the game by choosing a player to follow and committing my loyalty to him as a fan.</p>
<p>Andy and I decided to continue with our new anniversary tradition and went to Detroit again in February 2011. In addition to celebrating our marriage, we were also celebrating another important occasion&mdash;I had just reached the five-year benchmark of being free of breast cancer. Unfortunately, the celebration did not last long. Shortly after returning home from our trip, I learned that the cancer had recurred. The news was devastating and the timing seemed too ironic. Our feelings quickly turned from joy to sorrow. We took our time processing this sad news; however, it did not take Andy long to come up with the ultimate plan to lift my spirits. He told me that he had contacted the Detroit Red Wings and shared my story. They would be hosting us for a game in the fall, and I would soon be meeting Drew Miller!</p>
<p>I spent my spring and summer dealing with surgeries and chemotherapy, but the anticipation of going to Detroit kept me encouraged. Finally September arrived, and the new hockey season was upon us. We were contacted by Christy Hammond from the Red Wings' Community Relations Office. She invited us to come up for their Breast Cancer Awareness Night in October. This time Andy and I decided to take our daughter Kaitlyn with us to share in the fun. The seats were amazing and the game was thrilling, but I was anxious the entire time waiting for what would happen after the game!</p>
<p>The game ended and we quickly headed downstairs where we were escorted to the Red Wings locker room. My heart and my thoughts were racing as we walked down the hallway. What a difficult year this had been, and now I was being treated to a very special evening! I was so grateful to be sharing it with my precious daughter and my loving husband, who had been so thoughtful.</p>
<p>Drew and Christy greeted us outside the locker room. They were very kind and gracious hosts. We were given a personal tour of the locker room, we had several pictures taken with Drew, and we left with some great gifts and autographed memorabilia. It was an amazing and unforgettable experience!</p>
<p>It may have taken many years, but I finally discovered that my first impression was far from the truth. Hockey is about much more than "all the fighting." Hockey does not bring division but unity. It fosters a connection between a husband and wife. It shows that community extends far beyond the boundaries of a city or state. And it can bring healing when your spirit is broken. Thank you Andy, thank you Detroit Red Wings, and thank you hockey for bringing joy to my life and for being there when I needed you most.</p>
