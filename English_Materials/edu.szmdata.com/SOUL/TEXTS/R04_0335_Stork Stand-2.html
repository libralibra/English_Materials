<p>"We have to go, Mom," my young son had pleaded. "Dad needs to be there."</p>
<p>My husband had set up the trip to Kauai, Hawaii months ago. It was supposed to be for our 14th anniversary. Now, instead of a celebration, I was watching as my seven-year-old son Keefer spread part of my husband's ashes in the beautiful waves. It wasn't my idea. I didn't want to make the trip. I wanted to cancel it and try to make sense of what was left of my life. My son had different ideas.</p>
<p>Several months after we had returned from Kauai we were down on the Washington coast near our home when I watched my son step into the edge of the Pacific Ocean. He lifted his left leg, placed his foot against the inside of his right knee, drew his hands into a prayer position and bowed his head. I watched this for a couple of minutes, amazed at his balance and concentration. Finally I approached him and whispered, "What are you doing?"</p>
<p>He opened one eye and turned his head slightly toward me. "Talking to Dad," he said quietly.</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>He placed his left leg back down on the ground, turned to me and took my hands in his. "I'm talking to Dad."</p>
<p>"How?" I questioned, confused.</p>
<p>"Mom," he said, shaking his head back and forth. "We placed Dad's ashes in the Pacific Ocean while we were in Hawaii."</p>
<p>"Yeah." I looked into his eyes a little deeper.</p>
<p>"Well Mom, anywhere there's an ocean, I can talk to Dad. He's everywhere now."</p>
<p>That statement took my breath away. He was right of course. All of the oceans connect, so anywhere there's an ocean, his dad, my husband will be there.</p>
<p>In that moment, I felt my husband's spirit touch my heart just as my son's had.</p>
