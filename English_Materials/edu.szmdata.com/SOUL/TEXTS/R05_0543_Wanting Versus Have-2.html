<p>"Mom, I can't wait to own a fast Porsche someday and peel out and lay rubber in front of my friends," announced sixteen-year-old Steve, as he drove our old family car home after he passed his test for a Florida driver's license. I studied my son's excited face as he fantasized about his future transportation.</p>
<p>"I hope you get your dream car, but a Porsche is expensive," I replied. "You'll have to work hard to earn one."</p>
<p>Over the next several years Steve excelled. After high school he received a full scholarship to the prestigious Coast Guard Academy and graduated as an Ensign. Later he earned an MBA and a master's degree in engineering and got a job with a large corporation. The demands of working long hours competed with family obligations to his wife and young son.</p>
<p>One day he called and sounded happy.</p>
<p>"Hey, Mom. I'm inviting you and Dad to spend the weekend with us. Andrew is eager to play with his grandparents and Stephanie wants you to come for dinner on Friday."</p>
<p>"We'll be there."</p>
<p>We arrived to a round of hugs, and then Steve asked me to stand in front of the garage. I noticed a mysterious look on his face.</p>
<p>"I want to show you something, Mom."</p>
<p>He opened the garage door.</p>
<p>I shrieked and my mouth dropped open. I stared at the silver Porsche convertible, with the top down.</p>
<p>"Oh Steve! What a gorgeous car! It's your dream come true!"</p>
<p>My son grinned. I noticed tears of happiness in his eyes.</p>
<p>"It's a used 911 Carrera 4 Cabriolet, in mint condition, and one of the fastest cars on the road. I got a good deal, for less than half its original cost of a hundred grand. C'mon, let me take you for a ride and show you what this car can do. I'll take Dad later."</p>
<p>After I buckled up in the jazzy sports car, I studied my son's excited face, as I had the day he got his driver's license and fantasized about this car. Then he started the engine and we sped off. When my head was thrown against the headrest I clutched the door handle for support.</p>
<p>First, we roared from zero to sixty on an open stretch of road. Next, we raced up a steep bridge where I feared we'd go airborne, until Steve downshifted the engine. Finally, we executed a fast 180-degree turn in a deserted parking lot before we headed for home.</p>
<p>"Wow! That was a white knuckle ride!" I gasped, as I climbed out of the bucket seat.</p>
<p>"This car exceeded all my expectations," Steve said with pride.</p>
<p>Months later, during another visit, I stood next to Steve in his garage and admired his immaculate sports car. I was unprepared for what came next.</p>
<p>"I've decided to sell the Porsche," he said.</p>
<p>"Why?" I asked, in disbelief.</p>
<p>"I don't have time to enjoy it, and it's too small for our family."</p>
<p>Then, after a thoughtful pause, Steve shared an important lesson.</p>
<p>"I have discovered wanting a Porsche&nbsp;&#160;...&#160;was more fun than having one."</p>
