<p>My Reeboks awaken from their winter hibernation. It was a long, cold, and snowy New England winter. Although it is not quite spring, the weather has eased a bit so that I can resume my daily walk.</p>
<p>In the room next door, I can hear my sister Gail rummaging through her closet trying to locate her sneakers as well. "Are you ready?" I call out to Gail.</p>
<p>"I'm ready," she answers.</p>
<p>As we step out the door, I notice that Gail's jacket is not zipped closed and the lace on her left sneaker is loose. I quickly remedy this, and we begin our walk.</p>
<p>There is an eight-year difference in our ages. Actually, the age difference is much greater. Gail is developmentally disabled. Although she is 46 years old, she has the enthusiasm and curiosity of a young child and functions at about the level of a six-year-old.</p>
<p>We have a usual route that we take for our walks. Any walk with Gail includes a running barrage of questions.</p>
<p>We pass several people walking their dogs. "What kind of dog is that?" she asks.</p>
<p>"It's a German Shepherd," I say.</p>
<p>"Is it a boy or a girl?" asks Gail.</p>
<p>Granted, I've never seen this animal or its owner before, but Gail needs an answer from her big sister. To Gail, I am a fountain of all knowledge, and I do my best to provide the information&mdash;even if I do so with a little white lie.</p>
<p>"It's a girl," I say.</p>
<p>"What's her name?" says Gail.</p>
<p>"Gloria," I say. A few minutes later, we pass another dog, and Gail asks the same three questions. "Pug. Boy. Toby," is my rapid reply.</p>
<p>Babies are another of Gail's interests. Each baby she sees gets a smile. After they pass us, Gail always asks, "How old is that baby?"</p>
<p>I do my best to estimate the age of the baby. "Eight months old."</p>
<p>I could say any number. The actual number is unimportant, as she doesn't have a clear understanding of what various numbers mean. She simply wants answers to her questions.</p>
<p>I don't know when or how Gail and I ended up bonding so tightly. I think our chemistry was a gradual process that began in childhood and blossomed throughout the years. It may have started when she was a toddler and occasionally would have a mild seizure. I was a kid myself and didn't understand what was going on. I just knew Gail was in distress. I would sit by her side and hold her hand until the seizure passed. I guess that's when I started being a family caregiver.</p>
<p>Gail is thankful for even the smallest gesture. Little things like buying a package of her favorite brand of cookies. Hunkering down on the couch on a rainy afternoon and watching a movie together. Spontaneously singing and dancing in the living room when a popular song plays on the radio. No matter what it is, it brings a smile to her face.</p>
<p>I'm not pretending that there aren't challenges to being the caregiver to an adult with special needs. Every day, there are issues that cause me concern. I worry about her safety. I worry that she is healthy. I worry that others will be kind to her. Most of all, I worry that she's happy. I don't have a magic wand that can make everything better for Gail, but I try to make sure she has a good life.</p>
<p>Because of her developmental limitations, there can be some moments of frustration for both of us. Sometimes I can't figure out what's going on in her head, and she can't always express her thoughts clearly, which often leads to some tears. But her feelings are easily soothed.</p>
<p>As we pass a gnarly-looking tree, Gail suggests, "That tree looks like the one in the scary movie with the little girl."</p>
<p>The computer in my brain turns on and starts running through all the scary movies we've watched. "You mean <em>Poltergeist</em>?"</p>
<p>"You're right. You're right!" she says, delighted that I filled in the blank for her.</p>
<p>After we've walked about a mile or so, we turn around, and the questions resume. We pass a gray house, and Gail wants to know who lives there. We hear an airplane overhead, and Gail wants to know where it's going.</p>
<p>"There's those little men dogs," says Gail as two Jack Russell Terriers pass by with their owner.</p>
<p>"What's that squirrel doing?" Gail asks.</p>
<p>"He's looking for food," I answer.</p>
<p>"He must be hungry," says Gail. "Does he like spaghetti and meatballs?"</p>
<p>"No," I say. "He likes nuts."</p>
<p>After a walk with Gail, I feel like the smartest kid in the class because I'm able to answer all her questions. And that's all she really wants&mdash;just someone to connect with. Isn't that what we all want?</p>
<p>As much as she enjoys our walks, I think I get more from our relationship and time spent together than she does. Gail will never fully understand that going for a walk with her is quite simply the best part of my day.</p>
