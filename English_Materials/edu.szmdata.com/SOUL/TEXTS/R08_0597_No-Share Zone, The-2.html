<p>I am a disciplined person, especially when it comes to food. I watch what I eat. I regularly consume admirable quantities of fruits and vegetables. I strictly monitor my intake of sweets, resisting that deep craving to sink into the blissful blur of sugary extremes. I do not keep cookies, candy or cakes in the house. I rarely allow myself to order dessert in a restaurant. If I must have chocolate, I make sure I have to walk to the store (preferably through rain or snow) to get my candy fix.</p>
<p>But my discipline disappears when it comes to the Personal Box of Chocolates.</p>
<p>When such a gift comes into my life, I abandon all pretense of sensible eating and sink into that rare environment that many adults silently yearn for&mdash;the No-Share Zone.</p>
<p>This is what happened when a dear friend handed me a wrapped birthday present.</p>
<p>"Don't leave this sitting out in the heat," she said and I knew it contained chocolate. That night, I tore into the wrappings, then reverently removed the plastic that protected a small Whitman's Sampler.</p>
<p>I eased off the lid and smiled when I saw eight pieces of cozily cradled candies.</p>
<p>That small box of chocolate transported me to that mystical Zone, where politeness yielded to the primal and I embraced a supremely selfish, divinely decadent indulgence of the highest order. I was home alone. I was going to eat what I wanted, how I wanted, and I was not going to consider any other human being in the process.</p>
<p>Lavishly, I bit into two chocolates, the caramel and the coconut. I loved the insolence of only partially eating each one.</p>
<p>Then I reviewed the remaining chocolates, thinking about the order I might sample them in. I had no thoughts of calories or restraint&mdash;I had only the pure joy of possession.</p>
<p>Normally, of course, I loved to share. Had someone been around, I might have pleasantly offered her a chocolate. Had my friend given me a larger box, I would have saved it for a party or meeting. But she wisely fulfilled the secret wish of the chocolate-obsessed: permission to graze, glory, gorge and revel in sweet sensation.</p>
<p>When I was growing up, the Whitman box came into our household once a year, a symbol of romance from my father to my mother. My mother, normally a very sharing person, kept tight rein on the Sampler. Her face looked almost pained as she offered my brother and me one chocolate each. I remember studying the map of those chocolates more carefully that I ever studied any atlas. Nuts, chews, creams, caramels&mdash;making the right choice was crucial. After that one luscious candy, the box would disappear, hidden somewhere in my mother's bedroom.</p>
<p>At the time I thought my mother was selfish and unfair. But now, I understood and applauded her. Like so many moms, I realized how much she had to share, all day, every day. I imagined how utterly luxurious she must have felt, surveying her box of chocolates, sampling, tasting, and savoring, without worry that anyone would interfere.</p>
<p>Like my mother before me, my candy box allowed me to simply care for myself. The bliss of the No-Share Zone, that lovely luxury of not worrying about even one other person, renewed and delighted me.</p>
<p>My small Sampler was an invitation to be frivolous and beautifully indulgent. I took a bite of a nut bar and let the flavors flow through my mouth. For this moment, I was feeding only myself and that made the chocolate even sweeter.</p>
