<p>I was thirty-seven in 2009 when I got married. By that time I had an established career as a lawyer with the U.S. Government. Before my wedding, a number of people asked me if I planned to change my last name&mdash;something that has gone out of vogue for some women in established careers. My standard response was: "Wouldn't you?"</p>
<p>If you are a hockey fan, as I am, the answer is undoubtedly "You bet!" Who, in their right mind, would give up the opportunity to take the coolest last name ever&mdash;Zamboni? Not me. As a kid, I can remember eagerly anticipating the time between periods when that magnificent machine would come out and do what nothing else in the world can do&#160;...&#160;clean the ice methodically and perfectly. I remember my mom telling me the name of the machine was a Zamboni. Of course at the time I thought that was what the machine was named. I hadn't realized that Zamboni was a name brand, like Xerox or Kleenex. I thought it was the perfect name for the perfect machine. I love everything about the Zamboni machine: its boxy shape; the pattern it creates when cleaning the ice; and the beautiful shiny ice that it leaves in its path.</p>
<p>Imagine my delight when years later I met this wonderful guy named Zamboni. I loved the last name so much that I didn't use his first name at all. I just called him Zamboni. It was only after our relationship got more serious that I made an effort to use his first name, because I thought my family would think it weird to call my boyfriend by his last name. But that wasn't the case at all. When I first introduced him to my mother, she said: "So you are the Iceman." They hit it off immediately.</p>
<p>After changing my name to Zamboni, I couldn't wait for people's reaction when I introduced myself. "Did she really say her name was Zamboni?" But the reactions have not all been what I expected. Sure, if I'm in a hockey town like Pittsburgh or Boston there are signs of recognition. The most commonly asked question I get is: "Are you related to the family that invented the Zamboni?" My answer is "Yes." I have no idea if we are or not, but who am I hurting by claiming some relation to the inventor, Frank J. Zamboni? And, in a weird coincidence, my dad's first name is Frank and his middle initial is J.</p>
<p>I am incredibly disappointed when someone asks, "How do you spell that?" WHAT?? Who does not know how to spell Zamboni? Obviously not a hockey fan, I imagine. My husband had warned me that it happens more often than you would think. Something about the name starting with the letter "Z" throws people for a loop.</p>
<p>The second most commonly asked question I get is whether I have driven a Zamboni. My answer to this question depends on the audience, because there are two truthful answers: no and yes. No, I have never driven an actual Zamboni machine. But yes, whenever I am in the driver's seat with my husband as a passenger, I am indeed driving a Zamboni. One of these days I will submit a r&eacute;sum&eacute; to be a Zamboni driver and hope to at least get an interview for the job.</p>
