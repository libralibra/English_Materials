	<p>As I watched the woman walk by our table I said to my husband, "Get a look at her outfit. It looks like an artist's palette blew up on it. I wonder what she was thinking when she bought it."</p>

	<p>"Probably the same thing you thought when you bought it," he replied and popped a French fry in his mouth.</p>

	<p>Puzzled, I asked, "What are you talking about?"</p>

	<p>My French fry froze midway to my mouth when he replied, "You have the exact outfit at home."</p>

	<p>I devoured my French fry in quick, angry bites as I realized he was right. I demanded he tell me why he didn't say anything when I bought it.</p>
	<p>"I wasn't with you when you bought it."</p>

	<p>"Well, when I got home and tried it on why didn't you tell me I looked awful in it?"</p>

	<p>"I thought you knew. Besides, you seemed so happy."</p>

	<p>"You thought I intentionally bought a hideous outfit?"</p>

	<p>"Yes."</p>

	<p>"Why would you think that?"</p>

	<p>"Because you're always telling me I have no taste in clothes and that's why it's imperative you buy my clothes for me. Remember?"</p>
	<p>"Oh. Shut up and eat your French fries. When I ask for your honest opinion I expect you to give it to me."</p>
	<p>"No you don't."</p>
	<p>"Why would you say that?"</p>
	<p>"Remember when we first got married and went to the beach and you asked for my honest opinion of the bikini-clad girl who walked by?"</p>
	<p>"Yes. What's that got to do with anything?"</p>
	<p>"Well, thanks to your physical reaction I haven't walked upright since. And since I'm fond of all my bits-n-pieces I haven't given you my honest opinion in over twenty-five years. It works for us."</p>
	<p>"Then it's time we turn over a new leaf and be totally honest with each other. I've matured. I'll be able to handle the truth. Ready?"</p>
	<p>"Oh, this isn't going to end well."</p>
	<p>"So, now that we're being honest&nbsp;&#160;...&#160;that orange and black striped blouse I&nbsp;&#160;...&#160;"</p>
	<p>"Made you look like a bumblebee&mdash;a cute bumblebee, but a bumblebee nonetheless."</p>

	<p>"What about the low-cut blouse?"</p>
	<p>"I loved it. Honestly."</p>
	<p>"What about the color?"</p>
	<p>"Don't know. Don't care. Just loved how low-cut it was. Honestly."</p>
	<p>"What about the earrings I wore with it?"</p>
	<p>"Earrings? You wore earrings? Honestly, I never noticed. Did I tell you how much I loved the blouse?"</p>
	<p>"Certainly you must have liked the plaid, button down shirt I bought you."</p>
	<p>"Nope, I hated it. It's still in my closet, in the wrapper."</p>
	<p>"Oh."</p>
	<p>"I must say I had no idea honesty could be so refreshing and liberating. While we're at it, that purple and green dress you bought was a major mistake. And that Christmas sweater&nbsp;&#160;...&#160;I wonder what in the world you were thinking when you bought it."</p>
	<p>"Before I separate you from your bits-n-pieces why don't you cram the honesty and the French fries in your mouth?"</p>
	<p>"I told you this wouldn't end well."</p>
	<p>Honesty&mdash;don't believe the hype.</p>
