			<p>I love travelling in the country, but I don't like losing my way. I went on an excursion recently, but my trip took me longer than I expected.</p>
			<p>'I'm going to Woodford Green,' I said to the conductor as I got on the bus, 'but I don't know where it is.'</p>
			<p>'I'll tell you where to get off,' answered the conductor.</p>
			<p>I sat in the front of the bus to get a good view of the countryside. After some time, the bus stopped. Looking round, I realized with a shock that I was the only passenger left on the bus.</p>
			<p>'You'll have to get off here,' the conductor said. 'This is as far as we go.'</p>
			<p>'Is this Woodford Green?' I asked.</p>
			<p>'Oh dear,' said the conductor suddenly. 'I forgot to put you off.'</p>
			<p>'It doesn't matter, 'I said. 'I'll get off here.'</p>
			<p>'We're going back now,' said the conductor.</p>
			<p>'Well, in that case, I prefer to stay on the bus,' I answered.</p>
