			<p>Once a year, a race is held for old cars. A lot of cars entered for this race last year and there was a great deal of excitement just before it began. One of the most handsome cars was a Rolls-Royce Silver Ghost. The most unusual car was a Benz which had only three wheels. Built in 1885, it was the oldest car taking part. After a great many loud explosions, the race began. Many of the cars broke down on the course and some drivers spent more time under their cars than in them! A few cars, however, completed the race. The winning car reached a speed of forty miles an hour&#151;much faster than any of its rivals. It sped downhill at the end of the race and its driver had a lot of trouble trying to stop it.</p>
			<p>The race gave everyone a great deal of pleasure. It was very different from modern car races but no less exciting.</p>
