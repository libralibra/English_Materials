			<p>When the Ambassador of Escalopia returned home for lunch, his wife got a shock. He looked pale and his clothes were in a frightful state.</p>
			<p>'What has happened?' she asked. 'How did your clothes get into such a mess?'</p>
			<p>'A fire extinguisher, my dear,' answered the Ambassador drily. 'University students set the Embassy on fire this morning.'</p>
			<p>'Good heavens!' exclaimed his wife. 'And where were you at the time?'</p>
			<p>'I was in my office as usual,' answered the Ambassador. 'The fire broke out in the basement. I went down immediately, of course, and that fool, Horst, aimed a fire extinguisher at me. He thought I was on fire. I must definitely get that fellow posted.'</p>
			<p>The Ambassador's wife went on asking questions, when she suddenly noticed a big hole in her husband's hat.</p>
			<p>'And how can you explain that?' she asked.</p>
			<p>'Oh, that,' said the Ambassador. 'Someone fired a shot through my office window. Accurate, don't you think? Fortunately, I wasn't wearing it at the time. If I had been, I would not have been able to get home for lunch.'</p>
