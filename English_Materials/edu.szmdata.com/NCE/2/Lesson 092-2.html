		<p class="storyTitle">Asking for trouble</p>
			<p>It must have been about two in the morning when I returned home.I tried to wake up my wife by ringing the doorbell, but she was fast asleep, so I got a ladder from the shed in the garden, put it against the wall, and began climbing towards the bedroom window. I was almost there when a sarcastic voice below said, 'I don't think the windows need cleaning at this time of the night.' I looked down and nearly fell off the ladder when I saw a policeman. I immediately regretted answering in the way I did, but I said, 'I enjoy cleaning windows at night.'</p>
			<p>'So do I,' answered the policeman in the same tone. 'Excuse my interrupting you. I hate to interrupt a man when he's busy working, but would you mind coming with me to the station?'</p>
			<p>'Well, I'd prefer to stay here,' I said. 'You see, I've forgotten my key.'</p>
			<p>'Your what?' he called.</p>
			<p>'My key,' I shouted.</p>
			<p>Fortunately, the shouting woke up my wife who opened the window just as the policeman had started to climb towards me.</p>
