			<p>The secretary told me that Mr. Harmsworth would see me. I felt very nervous when I went into his office. He did not look up from his desk when I entered. After I had sat down, he said that business was very bad. He told me that the firm could not afford to pay such large salaries. Twenty people had already left. I knew that my turn had come.</p>
			<p>'Mr. Harmsworth,'I said in a weak voice.</p>
			<p>'Don't interrupt,'he said.</p>
			<p>Then he smiled and told me I would receive an extra thousand pounds a year!</p>
