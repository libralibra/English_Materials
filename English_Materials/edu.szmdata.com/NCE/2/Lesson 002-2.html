		<p class="storyTitle">Breakfast or lunch?</p>
			<p>It was Sunday. I never get up early on Sundays. I sometimes stay in bed until lunchtime. Last Sunday I got up very late. I looked out of the window. It was dark outside. 'What a day!' I thought.'It's raining again.' Just then, the telephone rang. It was my aunt Lucy. 'I've just arrived by train,' she said. 'I'm coming to see you.'</p>
			<p>'But I'm still having breakfast,' I said.</p>
			<p>'What are you doing?' she asked.</p>
			<p>'I'm having breakfast,' I repeated.</p>
			<p>'Dear me!' she said. 'Do you always get up so late? It's one o'clock!'</p>
