			<p>I crossed the street to avoid meeting him, but he saw me and came running towards me. It was no use pretending that I had not seen him, so I waved to him. I never enjoy meeting Nigel Dykes. He never has anything to do. No matter how busy you are, he always insists on coming with you. I had to think of a way of preventing him from following me around all morning.</p>
			<p>'Hello, Nigel,' I said. 'Fancy meeting you here!'</p>
			<p>'Hi, Elizabeth,' Nigel answered. 'I was just wondering how to spend the morning&#151;until I saw you. You're not busy doing anything, are you?'</p>
			<p>'No, not at all,' I answered. 'I'm going to&#160;...&#160;'</p>
			<p>'Would you mind my coming with you?' he asked, before I had finished speaking.</p>
			<p>'Not at all,' I lied, 'but I'm going to the dentist.'</p>
			<p>'Then I'll come with you,' he answered. 'There's always plenty to read in the waiting room!'</p>
