			<p>Last week at a dinner party, the hostess asked me to sit next to Mrs. Rumbold. Mrs. Rumbold was a large, unsmiling lady in a tight black dress. She did not even look up when I took my seat beside her. Her eyes were fixed on her plate and in a short time, she was busy eating. I tried to make conversation.</p>
			<p>'A new play is coming to "The Globe" soon,' I said. 'Will you be seeing it?'</p>
			<p>'No,' she answered.</p>
			<p>'Will you be spending your holidays abroad this year?' I asked.</p>
			<p>'No,' she answered.</p>
			<p>'Will you be staying in England?' I asked.</p>
			<p>'No,' she answered.</p>
			<p>In despair, I asked her whether she was enjoying her dinner.</p>
			<p>'Young man,' she answered, 'if you ate more and talked less, we would both enjoy our dinner!'</p>
