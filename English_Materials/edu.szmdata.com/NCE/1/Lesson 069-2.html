			<p class="storyTitle">The car race</p>
			<p>There is a car race near our town every year.</p>
			<p>In 1995, there was a very big race.</p>
			<p>There were hundreds of people there.</p>
			<p>My wife and I were at the race.</p>
			<p>Our friends Julie and Jack were there, too.</p>
			<p>You can see us in the crowd.</p>
			<p>We are standing on the left.</p>
			<p>There were twenty cars in the race.</p>
			<p>There were English cars, French cars,</p>
			<p>German cars, Italian cars,</p>
			<p>American cars and Japanese cars.</p>
			<p>It was an exciting finish.</p>
			<p>The winner was Billy Stewart.</p>
			<p>He was in car number fifteen.</p>
			<p>Five other cars were just behind him.</p>
			<p>On the way home, my wife said to me,</p>
			<p>'Don't drive so quickly!</p>
			<p>You're not Billy Stewart!'</p>
