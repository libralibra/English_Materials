		<title>Lesson 73: The way to King Street</title>
	</head>
	<body>
			<p class="storyTitle">The way to King Street</p>
			<p>Last week Mrs. Mills went to London.</p>
			<p>She does not know London very well, and she lost her way.</p>
			<p>Suddenly, she saw a man near a bus stop.</p>
			<p>'I can ask him the way,' she said to herself.</p>
			<p>'Excuse me,' she said.</p>
			<p>'Can you tell me the way to King Street, please?'</p>
			<p>The man smiled pleasantly.</p>
			<p>He did not understand English!</p>
			<p>He spoke German.</p>
			<p>He was a tourist.</p>
			<p>Then he put his hand into his pocket, and took out a phrasebook.</p>
			<p>He opened the book and found a phrase.</p>
			<p>He read the phrase slowly.</p>
			<p>'I am sorry,' he said.</p>
			<p>'I do not speak English.'</p>
