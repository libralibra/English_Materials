			<table border="0">
				<tr><td class="roles">MR. FRITH:</td><td>I like this television very much. How much does it cost?</td></tr>
				<tr><td class="roles">ASSISTANT:</td><td>It's the most expensive model in the shop. It costs five hundred pounds.</td></tr>
				<tr><td class="roles">MRS. FRITH:</td><td>That's too expensive for us. We can't afford all that money.</td></tr>
				<tr><td class="roles">ASSISTANT:</td><td>This model's less expensive than that one. It's only three hundred pounds. But, of course, it's not as good as the expensive one.</td></tr>
				<tr><td class="roles">MR. FRITH:</td><td>I don't like this model. The other model's more expensive, but it's worth the money.</td></tr>
				<tr><td class="roles">MR. FRITH:</td><td>Can we buy it on instalments?</td></tr>
				<tr><td class="roles">ASSISTANT:</td><td>Of course. You can pay a deposit of thirty pounds, and then fourteen pounds a month for three years.</td></tr>
				<tr><td class="roles">MR. FRITH:</td><td>Do you like it, dear?</td></tr>
				<tr><td class="roles">MRS. FRITH:</td><td>I certainly do, but I don't like the price. You always want the best, but we can't afford it. Sometimes you think you're a millionaire!</td></tr>
				<tr><td class="roles">MR. FRITH:</td><td>Millionaires don't buy things on instalments!</td></tr>
