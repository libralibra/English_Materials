		<title>Lesson 143: A walk through the woods</title>
	</head>
	<body>
			<p class="storyTitle">A walk through the woods</p>
			<p>I live in a very old town which is surrounded by beautiful woods.</p>
			<p>It is a famous beauty spot.</p>
			<p>On Sundays, hundreds of people come from the city to see our town and to walk through the woods.</p>
			<p>Visitors have been asked to keep the woods clean and tidy.</p>
			<p>Litter baskets have been placed under the trees, but people still throw their rubbish everywhere.</p>
			<p>Last Wednesday, I went for a walk in the woods.</p>
			<p>What I saw made me very sad.</p>
			<p>I counted seven old cars and three old refrigerators.</p>
			<p>The litter baskets were empty and the ground was covered with pieces of paper, cigarette ends, old tyres, empty bottles and rusty tins.</p>
			<p>Among the rubbish,</p>
			<p>I found a sign which said,</p>
			<p>'Anyone who leaves litter in these woods will be prosecuted!'</p>
