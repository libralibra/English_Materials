				<tr><td class="roles">LADY:</td><td>I'm afraid this green dress is too small for me as well. It's smaller than the blue one.</td></tr>
				<tr><td class="roles">LADY:</td><td>I don't like the colour either. It doesn't suit me at all. I think the blue dress is prettier.</td></tr>
				<tr><td class="roles">LADY:</td><td>Could you show me another blue dress? I want a dress like that one, but it must be my size.</td></tr>
				<tr><td class="roles">ASSISTANT:</td><td>I'm afraid I haven't got a larger dress. This is the largest dress in the shop.</td></tr>
