		<title>Lesson 141: Sally's first train ride</title>
	</head>
	<body>
			<p class="storyTitle">Sally's first train ride</p>
			<p>Last week, my four-year-old daughter, Sally, was invited to a children's party.</p>
			<p>I decided to take her by train.</p>
			<p>Sally was very excited because she had never travelled on a train before.</p>
			<p>She sat near the window and asked questions about everything she saw.</p>
			<p>Suddenly, a middle-aged lady got on the train and sat opposite Sally.</p>
			<p>'Hello, little girl,' she said.</p>
			<p>Sally did not answer, but looked at her curiously.</p>
			<p>The lady was dressed in a blue coat and a large, funny hat.</p>
			<p>After the train had left the station, the lady opened her handbag and took out her powder compact.</p>
			<p>She then began to make up her face.</p>
			<p>'Why are you doing that?' Sally asked.</p>
			<p>'To make myself beautiful,' the lady answered.</p>
			<p>She put away her compact and smiled kindly.</p>
			<p>'But you are still ugly,' Sally said.</p>
			<p>Sally was amused, but I was very embarrassed!</p>
