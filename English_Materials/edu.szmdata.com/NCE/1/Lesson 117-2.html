		<title>Lesson 117: Tommy's breakfast</title>

			<p class="storyTitle">Tommy's breakfast</p>
			<p>When my husband was going into the dining room this morning, he dropped some coins on the floor.</p>
			<p>There were coins everywhere.</p>
			<p>We looked for them, but we could not find them all.</p>
			<p>While we were having breakfast, our little boy, Tommy, found two small coins on the floor.</p>
			<p>He put them both into his mouth.</p>
			<p>We both tried to get the coins, but it was too late.</p>
			<p>Tommy had already swallowed them!</p>
			<p>Later that morning, when I was doing the housework, my husband phoned me from the office.</p>
			<p>'How's Tommy?' he asked.</p>
			<p>'I don't know,' I answered,</p>
			<p>'Tommy's been to the toilet three times this morning, but I haven't had any change yet!'</p>
