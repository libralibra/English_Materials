			<p class="storyTitle">A true story</p>
			<p>Do you like stories?</p>
			<p>I want to tell you a true story.</p>
			<p>It happened to a friend of mine a year ago.</p>
			<p>While my friend, George, was reading in bed, two thieves climbed into his kitchen.</p>
			<p>After they had entered the house, they went into the dining room.</p>
			<p>It was very dark, so they turned on a torch.</p>
			<p>Suddenly, they heard a voice behind them.</p>
			<p>'What's up? What's up?' someone called.</p>
			<p>The thieves dropped the torch and ran away as quickly as they could.</p>
			<p>George heard the noise and came downstairs quickly.</p>
			<p>He turned on the light, but he couldn't see anyone.</p>
			<p>The thieves had already gone.</p>
			<p>But George's parrot, Henry, was still there.</p>
			<p>'What's up, George?' he called.</p>
			<p>'Nothing, Henry,' George said and smiled.</p>
			<p>'Go back to sleep.'</p>
