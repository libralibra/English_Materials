<p class="subTitle">5.46 used with the present perfect</p>
<p>When you use the present perfect to mention something that is still relevant to the present, you can add an adjunct of frequency to indicate that the action was repeated.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>I've</i> <b>often</b> <i>wondered why we didn't move years ago</i>.</li>
	<li><i>Britain and other Western nations have</i> <b>frequently</b> <i>told South Africa that they want Mandela released</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The use of the present perfect to talk about situations which are still relevant is explained in paragraph <b>5.33</b>.</p>
<p class="clgm_hw">5.47</p>
<p>Note that if you are talking about a quality, attitude, or possession that still exists or is still relevant, you need to use the present perfect with an adjunct of duration.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>We</i><b>'ve had</b> <i>it</i> <b>for fifteen years</b>.</li>
	<li><i>He</i><b>'s always liked</b> <i>you, you know</i>.</li>
	<li><i>I</i> <b>have known</b> <i>him</i> <b>for years</b>.</li>
	<li><i>My people</i> <b>have been</b> <i>at war</i> <b>since 1917</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p class="clgm_hw">5.48</p>
<p>If you use the present perfect and the present perfect continuous to mention a continuing activity that began in the past, you can add an adjunct of duration to indicate how long it has been going on.</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>For many years</b>, <i>the TUC</i> <b>has been advocating</b> <i>child care facilities at work</i>.</li>
	<li><i>They</i> <b>have been meeting</b> <i>together weekly now</i> <b>for two years</b>.</li>
	<li><i>He</i> <b>has looked</b> <i>after me well</i> <b>since his mother died</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The use of the present perfect and the present perfect continuous to talk about activities that began in the past is explained in paragraph <b>5.35</b>.</p>
