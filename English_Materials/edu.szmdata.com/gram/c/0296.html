<p class="subTitle">2.141 USAGE NOTE</p>
<p>You can use some submodifiers in front of 'the same as' and 'the same'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>They are</i> <b>virtually the same as</b> <i>other single cells</i>.</li>
	<li><i>'You two look</i> <b>exactly the same'</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is a list of submodifiers used with 'the same as' and 'the same':</p>
<ul>
	<li class="c_list"><b>exactly, just, more or less, much, nearly, virtually</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Submodifiers are explained in paragraphs <b>2.145 to 2.173</b>.</p>
<p class="clgm_hw">2.142</p>
<p>You can put a noun such as 'size', 'length', or 'colour' after 'the same'. For example, if you want to say that one street is as long as another one, you can say that the first street is 'the same length as' the second one, or that the two streets are 'the same length'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>Its brain was about</i> <b>the same size</b> <i>as that of a gorilla</i>.</li>
	<li><i>They were almost</i> <b>the same height</b>.</li>
</ul>
