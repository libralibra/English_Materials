<p class="subTitle">6.48 position in clause</p>
<p>You can use adverbs of degree in the usual positions for adjuncts.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>I admired him</i> <b>greatly</b>.</li>
	<li><i>I</i> <b>greatly</b> <i>enjoyed working with them</i>.</li>
	<li><i>Protesters say that tunnels could</i> <b>greatly</b> <i>reduce the environmental disturbance</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, you rarely use an adverb of degree at the beginning of a clause. For example, you do not usually say 'Greatly I admired him'. For more information about placing adverbs at the beginning of a clause, see paragraph <b>10.93</b>.</p>
<p>A few adverbs of degree are nearly always used in front of the main verb: , almost, largely, nearly, really, virtually</p>
<p>For example, you usually say 'He almost got there', not 'He got there almost'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>The president of the European Commission</i> <b>largely</b> <i>ignored the British conditions</i>.</li>
	<li><i>He</i> <b>really</b> <i>enjoyed talking about flying</i>.</li>
	<li><i>The result</i> <b>virtually</b> <i>ensures Scotland's place in the finals</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some adverbs of degree are almost always used after the main verb: , altogether, enormously, hard, outright, somewhat, tremendously, well</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>This was a different level of communication</i> <b>altogether</b>.</li>
	<li><i>Mr Botha exaggerated</i> <b>somewhat</b> <i>in comparing the incursion with Hitler's invasion of Poland</i>.</li>
	<li><i>Spear says she admires Lloyd's</i> <b>tremendously</b>.</li>
</ul>
