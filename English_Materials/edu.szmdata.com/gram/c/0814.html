<p class="subTitle">5.7 The present</p>
<p>In situations where you are discussing an existing state of affairs, you use a verb which is in the present tense. Usually, the verb tense is sufficient to indicate that you are referring to the present. You normally only use an adjunct of time for emphasis, or to refer to something which is unrelated to the present moment.</p>
