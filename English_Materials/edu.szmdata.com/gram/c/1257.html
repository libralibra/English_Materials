<p class="subTitle">9.42 'this' and 'these'</p>
<p>The use of 'this' to refer back to something was explained in paragraphs <b>9.7 to 9.10</b>. You can also use 'this' or 'these' to refer forward to what you are about to say. They can be both pronouns and determiners. Note that 'these' can only be a pronoun when it is the subject.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>Well, you might not believe</i> <b>this</b> <i>but I don't drink very much</i>.</li>
	<li><i>Perhaps I shouldn't confess</i> <b>this</b><i>, but I did on one occasion break the law</i>.</li>
	<li><b>This</b> <i>chapter will follow the same pattern as the previous one</i>.</li>
	<li><b>These</b> <i>were the facts: On a warm February afternoon, Gregory Clark and a friend were cruising down Washington Boulevard in a Mustang</i>.</li>
	<li><i>On the blackboard</i> <b>these</b> <i>words were written: Reading. Writing. Arithmetic</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p class="clgm_hw">9.43</p>
<p>When 'this' and 'these' are used to refer forward to something, they are most commonly used with nouns which refer to a piece of writing (see paragraph <b>9.23</b>). Sometimes they are used with nouns which refer to what is said (see paragraph <b>9.19</b>) and with nouns which refer to ideas (see paragraph <b>9.20</b>). They occasionally occur with nouns which refer to actions or events (see paragraph <b>9.21</b>).</p>
