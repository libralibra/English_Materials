<p class="subTitle">6.28 USAGE NOTE</p>
<p>If there is no adverb related to an adjective, and you want to give additional information about an event or situation, you can often use a prepositional phrase.</p>
<p>In some cases, the prepositional phrase involves a noun that is related to the adjective. For example, there is no adverb related to the adjective 'difficult', but you can use the related noun 'difficulty' in the prepositional phrase 'with difficulty' instead.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>He stood up slowly and</i> <b>with difficulty</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>In other cases, for example with adjectives that end in '-ly', a general noun such as 'way', 'manner', or 'fashion' is used.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>'Fishing?' she said</i> <b>in a silly way</b>.</li>
	<li><i>He greeted us</i> <b>in his usual friendly fashion</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Prepositional phrases may be used even if an adverb does exist, for example when you want to add more detailed information or to add emphasis.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>She comforted the bereaved relatives</i> <b>in a dignified, compassionate and personalized manner</b>.</li>
	<li><i>At these extreme velocities, materials behave</i> <b>in a totally different manner from normal</b>.</li>
</ul>
