<p class="subTitle">3.75 indirect objects in prepositional phrases</p>
<p>Instead of putting the indirect object in front of the direct object, it is possible to put it in a prepositional phrase that comes after the direct object.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>He handed his room key</i> <b>to the receptionist</b>.</li>
	<li><i>Ralph passed a message</i> <b>to Jack</b>.</li>
	<li><i>He gave it</i> <b>to me</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>This structure is used particularly in cases where you want to focus on the indirect object. You can use it, for example, when the indirect object is significantly longer than the direct object.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>He had taught English</i> <b>to all the youth of Ceylon and India</b>.</li>
	<li><i>The Express offered $100</i> <b>to any reader who could relate what Bal had said</b>.</li>
</ul>
