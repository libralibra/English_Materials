<p class="subTitle">2.215 PRODUCTIVE FEATURE</p>
<p>There are many nouns which refer to groups that can be used as partitives. They are linked by 'of' to plural nouns which indicate what the group consists of.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>It was evaluated by an independent</i> <b>team of</b> <i>inspectors</i>.</li>
	<li><i>A</i> <b>group of</b> <i>journalists gathered at the airport to watch us take off</i>.</li>
	<li><i>...a</i> <b>bunch of</b> <i>flowers</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is a list of partitives referring to groups:</p>
<ul>
	<li class="c_list"><b>audience of, bunch of, clump of, company of, family of, flock of, gang of, group of, herd of, team of, troupe of</b></li>
</ul>
<p>This use of partitives referring to groups is a <b>productive feature</b>of English because you can use any noun referring to a group of people or things in this way. For example, you can talk about 'an army of volunteers'. Productive features are explained in the Introduction.</p>
