<p class="subTitle">10.30 focusing on what someone wants or needs</p>
<p>If you want to focus on the thing that someone wants, needs, or likes, you can use a cleft sentence beginning with a clause consisting of 'what' followed by the subject and a verb such as 'want' or 'need'. After this clause, you use the verb 'be' and a noun group referring to the thing wanted, needed, or liked.</p>
<p>Here is a list of verbs which can be used with 'what' in this structure:</p>
<ul>
	<li class="c_list"><b>adore, dislike, enjoy, hate, like, loathe, love, need, prefer, want</b></li>
</ul>
<p>For example, instead of saying 'We need a bigger garden', you can say 'What we need is a bigger garden'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>What we as a nation want is not words but deeds</i>.</li>
	<li><i>What you need is a doctor</i>.</li>
	<li><i>What he needed was an excuse to talk</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can use 'all' instead of 'what' with the verbs 'want' or 'need' if you want to emphasize that someone wants or needs a particular thing and nothing else.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>All they want is a holiday</i>.</li>
	<li><i>All a prisoner needed was a pass</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you do not want to mention the agent in the above structures, you can use a passive form of the verb, after 'what' or 'all that'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>What was needed was an organized struggle</i>.</li>
	<li><i>All that was needed was to place strips of the paper in a thin rubber tube</i>.</li>
</ul>
