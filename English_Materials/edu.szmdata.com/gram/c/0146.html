<p class="subTitle">1.168 generalizing</p>
<p>Another group of nouns which can be used with just 'the' are nouns which are normally <b>count nouns</b> but which are used in the singular to refer to something more general.</p>
<p>For example, you can use 'the theatre' or 'the stage' to refer to all entertainment performed in theatres. Similarly, 'the screen' refers to films in general, and 'the law' refers to the system of laws in a country.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>For him</i>, <b>the stage</b> <i>was just a way of earning a living</i>.</li>
	<li><i>He was as dashing in real life as he was on</i> <b>the screen</b>.</li>
	<li><i>They do not hesitate to break</i> <b>the law</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some nouns which normally refer to an individual thing or person can be used in the singular with 'the' to refer generally to a system or service in a particular place. For example, you can use 'the bus' to refer to a bus service and 'the phone' to refer to a telephone system.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>How long does it take on</i> <b>the train?</b></li>
	<li><i>We rang for</i> <b>the ambulance</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Nouns referring to musical instruments can be used in the singular with 'the' when you are talking about someone's ability to play a particular kind of instrument.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>'You play</i> <b>the oboe</b>, <i>I see,' said Simon</i>.</li>
	<li><i>Geoff plays</i> <b>the piano</b> <i>for hours</i>.</li>
</ul>
