<p class="subTitle">7.40 reporting suggestions</p>
<p>When someone makes a suggestion about what someone else, not their hearer, should do, you report it by using a 'that'-clause. This clause often contains a <b>modal</b>, usually 'should'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>He proposes</i> <b>that the Government should hold an inquiry</b>.</li>
	<li><i>It was definite enough for a doctor to advise</i> <b>that she should have treatment</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that this structure can also be used to report a suggestion about what the hearer should do. Consider the example: 'Her father had suggested that she ought to see a doctor'; her father might have suggested it directly to her.</p>
<p>If you do not use a modal, the result is more formal.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>Someone suggested</i> <b>that they break into small groups</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Notice that when you leave out the modal, the verb in the reported clause still has the form it would have if the modal were present. This use of the base form is sometimes called the <b>subjunctive</b>.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>It was his doctor who advised that he</i> <b>change</b> <i>his job</i>.</li>
	<li><i>I suggested that he</i> <b>bring</b> <i>them all up to the house</i>.</li>
	<li><i>He urges that the restrictions</i> <b>be lifted</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is a list of reporting verbs which can be followed by a 'that'-clause containing a modal or a subjunctive:</p>
<ul>
	<li class="c_list"><b>advise, agree, ask, beg, command, decree, demand, direct, insist, intend, order, plead, pray, prefer, propose, recommend, request, rule, stipulate, suggest, urge</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Note that 'advise', 'ask', 'beg', 'command', 'order', and 'urge' can also be used with an object and a 'to'-infinitive, and 'agree', 'pray', and 'suggest' can also be used with 'that'-clauses without a modal.</p>
<p class="clgm_hw">7.41</p>
<p>When someone makes a suggestion about what someone else should do, or about what they themselves and someone else should do, you can report this using one of the reporting verbs 'suggest', 'advise', 'propose', or 'recommend' with a non-finite clause beginning with a present participle.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>Barbara suggested</i> <b>going to another coffee-house</b>.</li>
	<li><i>Deirdre proposed</i> <b>moving to New York</b>.</li>
</ul>
