<p class="subTitle">7.12 indicating the way that something is said</p>
<p>When you use a quote structure or a report structure, you can give more information about the way that something is said by putting an adverb or a prepositional phrase after the reporting verb.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>'I've got the key!' he announced</i> <b>triumphantly</b>.</li>
	<li><i>His secretary explained</i> <b>patiently</b> <i>that this was the only time he could spare from his busy schedule</i>.</li>
	<li><i>He replied</i> <b>with disgust</b><i>, 'Most of them were too young.'</i></li>
</ul>
<p>You can indicate how the thing that is said fits into the conversation by using a prepositional phrase.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>'They moved her to Rose Cottage,' Emily shouted</i> <b>in explanation</b>.</li>
</ul>
