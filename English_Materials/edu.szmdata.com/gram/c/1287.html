<p class="subTitle">10.13 USAGE NOTE</p>
<p>When people in general are the agents, an <b>active</b> form of the verb is sometimes used instead, with 'you' or 'they' as the subject. 'One' is used as the subject in this kind of clause in formal speech and writing.</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>You</b> <i>can't buy iron now, only steel</i>.</li>
	<li><b>They</b> <i>say she's very bright</i>.</li>
	<li><i>It is a matter of personal belief, like the colour of socks</i> <b>one</b> <i>prefers to wear or the television programmes</i> <b>one</b> <i>chooses to watch</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>For more information, see the section on personal pronouns beginning at paragraph <b>1.96</b>.</p>
<p>You can also use the <b>indefinite pronouns</b> 'someone' or 'something'. This allows you to mention an agent, without specifying who or what they are. For more information about indefinite pronouns, see paragraphs <b>1.127 to 1.140</b>.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>I think</i> <b>someone</b><i>'s calling you</i>.</li>
	<li><b>Something</b> <i>has upset him</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Ergative verbs</b> can also enable you to avoid mentioning the performer of an action. For example, instead of saying 'She opened the door', you can say 'The door opened'. See the section on ergative verbs in paragraphs <b>3.60 to 3.68</b>.</p>
