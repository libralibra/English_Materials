<p class="subTitle">1.28 quantifying</p>
<p>Although uncount nouns refer to things which cannot be counted and are not used with numbers, you often want to refer to an amount of something which is expressed by an uncount noun.</p>
<p>Sometimes, you can do this by putting a <b>general determiner</b> such as 'all', 'enough', 'little', or 'some' in front of the noun.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>It gave him</i> <b>little</b> <i>time</i>.</li>
	<li><i>There's</i> <b>some</b> <i>chocolate cake over there</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>For more information on general determiners which can be used with uncount nouns, see paragraph <b>1.210</b>.</p>
<p>You can also put a <b>quantifier</b> in front of the noun. For example, when you refer to water you can say 'drops of water', 'a cup of water', 'four gallons of water', and so on.</p>
<p>The use of quantifiers with uncount nouns is explained in paragraphs <b>2.193 to 2.210</b>.</p>
