<p class="subTitle">6.5 adding meaning to verb groups</p>
<p>The most common way in which adverbial groups give additional information is by adding something to the meaning of a verb group within a clause.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>He nodded and smiled</i> <b>warmly</b>.</li>
	<li><i>The report says that hospitals and rescue services coped</i> <b>extremely well</b>.</li>
	<li><i>Nevertheless, he does dramatize</i> <b>pretty faithfully</b> <i>this Joan of Arc period</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Prepositional phrases have a wider range of meanings.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>It was estimated that at least 2,000 people were</i> <b>on the two trains</b>.</li>
	<li><i>Kenny Stuart came second, knocking two minutes</i> <b>off his previous best time</b>.</li>
	<li><i>Unemployment has fallen</i> <b>below two million</b> <b>for the first time</b> <b>since 1980</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Many <b>intransitive verbs</b> normally require an adjunct. See paragraph <b>3.11</b> for more information about these.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>Ashton had behaved</i> <b>abominably</b>.</li>
	<li><i>She turned and rushed</i> <b>out of the room</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some <b>transitive verbs</b> normally require an adjunct after the object of the verb. For more information about these, see paragraph <b>3.20</b>.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>I put my hand</i> <b>on the door</b>.</li>
</ul>
