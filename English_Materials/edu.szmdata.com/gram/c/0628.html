<p class="subTitle">4.43 Forming negative statements</p>
<p>When you want to say that something is not true, is not happening, or is not the case, you normally use a <b>negative statement</b>. Negative statements contain words like 'not', 'never', or 'nowhere'. These are called <b>negative words</b>.</p>
<p>Here is the list of negative words in English:</p>
<ul>
	<li class="c_list"><b>neither, never, no, nobody, none, no one, nor, not, nothing, nowhere</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Negative words indicate the opposite of something or an absence of something.</p>
<p class="clgm_hw">4.44</p>
<p>There are some other words such as 'unhappy' or 'meaningless' which give a negative meaning to a statement because they contain a negative affix such as 'un-' or '-less'. These words are explained in paragraphs <b>4.76</b> to <b>4.82</b>.</p>
<p>Another group of words such as 'scarcely' and 'seldom' can be used to make a statement almost negative. These words are called <b>broad negatives</b>. They are explained in paragraphs <b>4.83 to 4.90</b>.</p>
<p class="clgm_hw">4.45</p>
<p>If a statement about the existence of something has a negative word in it, you use 'any' (not 'no') as a determiner in front of the following noun group. You can also use a word beginning with 'any-' such as 'anyone' or 'anywhere'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>We had</i><b>n't any</b> <i>money</i>.</li>
	<li><i>He writes poetry and</i> <b>never</b> <i>shows it to</i> <b>anyone</b>.</li>
	<li><i>It is</i> <b>impossible</b> <i>to park the car</i> <b>anywhere</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>For another use of 'any' see paragraph <b>2.168</b>.</p>
