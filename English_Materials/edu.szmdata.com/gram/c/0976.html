<p class="subTitle">6.68 prepositions with comparative forms</p>
<p>'Near', 'near to', and 'close to' have comparative forms that can also be used as prepositions.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>New lockers had been installed</i> <b>nearer their workplace</b>.</li>
	<li><i>Venus is much</i> <b>nearer to the Sun</b> <i>than the Earth</i>.</li>
	<li><i>The judge's bench was</i> <b>closer to me</b> <i>than Ruchell's chair</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p class="clgm_hw">6.69</p>
<p>If you want to say more exactly which part of the other thing an object is nearest to, or exactly which part of an area or room it is in, you can use one of the following prepositions: 'at', 'by', 'in', 'near', 'on', 'round'. 'To' and 'towards', usually used to indicate direction, are used to express position in a more approximate way.</p>
<p>The objects of the prepositions are nouns referring to parts of an object or place, such as 'top', 'bottom', and 'edge'. Here is a list of words which are used to refer to parts of an object or place:</p>
<ul>
	<li class="c_list"><b>back, bottom, edge, end, front, left, middle, right, side, top,  --- , east, east-west, north, north-east, north-west, south, south-east, south-west, west,  --- , bankside, bedside, dockside, glenside, graveside, hillside, kerbside, lakeside, mountainside, poolside, quayside, ringside, roadside, seaside, waterside</b></li>
</ul>
<p>When the place that you are referring to is obvious or has been stated earlier, you use the nouns in the singular with the determiner 'the'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>I ran inside and bounded up the stairs. Wendy was standing</i> <b>at the top</b>.</li>
	<li><i>He was sitting</i> <b>towards the rear</b>.</li>
	<li><b>To the north</b> <i>are the main gardens</i>.</li>
	<li><i>We found him sitting</i> <b>by the fireside</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other determiners, for example 'this' and 'each', can be used with nouns such as 'side', 'end', and 'edge', because an object or place may have several sides, ends or edges.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>Roger sharpened a stick</i> <b>at both ends</b>.</li>
	<li><i>Standing</i> <b>on either side</b> <i>of him were two younger men</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the person or thing has been mentioned or is obvious, a possessive determiner can be used.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>It was a very tall elm and there were thorn bushes</i> <b>round its base</b>.</li>
	<li><i>There was a gate</i> <b>on our left</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p class="clgm_hw">6.70</p>
<p>Note that two or three word prepositions which include the word 'of' are more specific because 'of' can be followed by any nominal group.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>She turned and rushed</i> <b>out of the room</b>.</li>
	<li><i>There was a man standing</i> <b>in front of me</b>.</li>
	<li><i>My sister started piling the books</i> <b>on top of each other</b>.</li>
</ul>
