<p class="subTitle">3.39 indicating a brief event</p>
<p>One difference in meaning between using a delexical structure and a verb with a similar meaning is that the delexical structure can give the impression that the event you are describing is brief. For example, 'She gave a scream' suggests that there was only one quick scream, whereas 'She screamed' does not suggest that the event was brief.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>Mr. Sutton</i> <b>gave a shout</b> <i>of triumph</i>.</li>
	<li><i>Zoe</i> <b>gave a sigh</b> <i>of relief</i>.</li>
	<li><i>He</i> <b>gave a laugh</b>.</li>
</ul>
