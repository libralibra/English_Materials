<p class="subTitle">5.114 Adjuncts of frequency</p>
<p>Some adverbs and adverbial expressions indicate approximately how many times something happens:</p>
<p><b>again and again, a lot, all the time, always, constantly, continually, continuously, ever, frequently, from time to time, hardly ever, infrequently, intermittently, much, never, normally, occasionally, often, periodically, rarely, regularly, repeatedly, seldom, sometimes, sporadically, usually</b></p>
<ul>
	<li><i>We</i> <b>often</b> <i>swam in the surf in front of our seaside cottages</i>.</li>
	<li><b>Sometimes</b> <i>I wish I was back in Africa</i>.</li>
	<li><i>We were</i> <b>always</b> <i>being sent home</i>.</li>
	<li><i>He blinked</i> <b>a lot</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>'Never' is a negative adverb.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>She</i> <b>never</b> <i>goes abroad</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>'Ever' is only used in questions, negative clauses, and 'if'-clauses.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>Have you</i> <b>ever</b> <i>been to a concert?</i></li>
</ul>
<p>'Much' is usually used with 'not'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>The men did</i><b>n't</b> <i>talk</i> <b>much</b> <i>to each other</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some adverbs of frequency such as 'often' and 'frequently' can also be used in the comparative and superlative.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>Disasters can be prevented</i> <b>more often</b> <i>than in the past</i>.</li>
	<li><i>I preached much</i> <b>more often</b> <i>than that</i>.</li>
	<li><i>They cried for their mothers</i> <b>less often</b> <i>than might have been expected</i>.</li>
	<li><i>...the mistakes which women make</i> <b>most frequently</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p class="clgm_hw">5.115</p>
<p>To indicate how many times something happens, you can use a specific number, 'several', or 'many' followed by 'times'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>We had to ask</i> <b>three times</b>.</li>
	<li><i>It's an experience I've repeated</i> <b>many times</b> <i>since</i>.</li>
	<li><i>He carefully aimed his rifle and fired</i> <b>several times</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the number you are using is 'one' you use 'once' (not 'one time') in this structure. If it is 'two' you can use 'twice'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>I've been out with him</i> <b>once</b>, <i>that's all</i>.</li>
	<li><i>The car broke down</i> <b>twice</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>If something happens regularly, you can say how many times it happens within a period of time by adding 'a' and a word referring to a period of time.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>The group met</i> <b>once a week</b>.</li>
	<li><i>You only have a meal</i> <b>three times a day</b>.</li>
	<li><i>The committee meets</i> <b>twice a year</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also use a frequency expression such as 'once' with a unit of time preceded by 'every' to say that something happens a specified number of times and on a regular basis within that unit of time.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>The average Briton moves house</i> <b>once every seven and a half years</b>.</li>
	<li><i>We meet</i> <b>twice every Sunday</b>.</li>
	<li><b>Three times every day</b>, <i>he would come to the kiosk to see we were all right</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>If an event happens regularly during a specific period of the day, you can use the period of day instead of 'times':</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>I used to go in</i> <b>three mornings a week</b>.</li>
	<li><i>He was going out</i> <b>four</b> <i>and sometimes</i> <b>five nights a week</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>A regular rate or quantity can also be expressed by adding 'a' and a general time word. 'Per' can be used instead of 'a', especially in technical contexts.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>They again ordered him to pay</i> <b>ten shillings a month</b>.</li>
	<li><i>I was only getting</i> <b>three hours of sleep a night</b>.</li>
	<li><i>...rising upwards at the rate of</i> <b>300 feet per second</b>.</li>
	<li><i>He hurtles through the air at</i> <b>600 miles per hour</b>.</li>
</ul>
