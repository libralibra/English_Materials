<p class="subTitle">4.99 attitude to intentions</p>
<p>You can use modals to indicate your attitude towards the things you intend to do, or intend not to do. For example, if you say 'I won't go without Simon', you are expressing strong unwillingness to do something. If you say 'I can't go without Simon', you are expressing unwillingness, but at the same time you are indicating that there is a special reason for your unwillingness. If you say 'I couldn't go without Simon', you are indicating that you are unwilling to go without Simon, because to do so would be unfair or morally wrong.</p>
