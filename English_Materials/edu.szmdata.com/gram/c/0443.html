<p class="subTitle">3.16 different types of object</p>
<p>Many verbs which are only used in transitive clauses can take a large range of objects. For example, there are many things you can 'want': money, a rest, success, and so on.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>She</i> <b>wanted</b> <i>some help</i>.</li>
	<li><i>I</i> <b>put</b> <i>my hand on the door</i>.</li>
	<li><i>She</i> <b>described</b> <i>her background</i>.</li>
	<li><i>I still</i> <b>support</b> <i>the government</i>.</li>
	<li><i>He</i> <b>had</b> <i>always</i> <b>liked</b> <i>Mr Phillips</i>.</li>
	<li><i>Japan</i> <b>has</b> <i>a population of about a hundred million</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some transitive verbs have a restricted range of objects, because of their meaning. For example, the object of the verb 'kill' must be something that is alive. The object of the verb 'waste' must be something you can use, such as time, money, or food.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>They</i> <b>killed</b> <i>huge elephants with tiny poisoned darts</i>.</li>
	<li><i>Why</i> <b>waste</b> <i>money on them?</i></li>
</ul>
<p class="clgm_hw">3.17</p>
<p>Here is a list of verbs which are transitive:</p>
<ul>
	<li class="c_list"><b>achieve, address, admire, affect, afford, avoid, bear, believe, blame, build, buy, calm, carry, catch, claim, commit, complete, concern, consider, control, correct, cover, create, cut, damage, demand, describe, design, desire, destroy, discover, discuss, display, do, dread, enjoy, equal, exchange, expect, experience, express, favour, fear, fill, find, free, get, give, grant, guard, handle, hate, have, hear, heat, hire, hit, imagine, include, influence, introduce, issue, justify, keep, kill, know, lack, like, list, lower, maintain, make, mean, mention, name, need, own, plant, prefer, prevent, process, produce, pronounce, protect, provide, raise, reach, receive, recommend, record, release, remember, remove, rent, report, respect, reveal, risk, see, seek, specify, spot, support, take, test, threaten, trust, upset, use, value, want, warm, waste, wear, welcome</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Note that 'do' and 'have' are also very often used as <b>auxiliaries</b>.</p>
<p>'Have got' and 'has got' are often used instead of the present tense of 'have' when talking about possession. The forms of 'have' behave like auxiliaries when used like this before 'got'. 'Had got' is sometimes used when referring to the past, but 'had' is often used instead.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>I</i><b>'ve got</b> <i>an umbrella</i>.</li>
	<li><i>She</i><b>'s got</b> <i>a degree</i>.</li>
	<li><i>He</i><b>'d got</b> <i>over fifty horses</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>'Measure' and 'weigh' are sometimes considered to be transitive verbs when used to state measurements and weights. This use is explained in paragraph <b>2.269</b>. 'Cost' is used to state the cost of something, as in 'An adult ticket costs 90p'.</p>
