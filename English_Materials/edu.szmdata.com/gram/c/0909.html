<p class="subTitle">5.119 particular occurrences of an event</p>
<p>The adverbs 'first', 'next', and 'last' are used to indicate the stage at which an event takes place.</p>
<p>The adverb 'first', the noun group 'the first time', and the prepositional phrase 'for the first time' can indicate the first occurrence of an event.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>He was, I think, in his early sixties when I</i> <b>first</b> <i>encountered him</i>.</li>
	<li><i>They had seen each other</i> <b>first</b> <i>a week before, outside this hotel</i>.</li>
	<li><i>...the tactical war games which were</i> <b>first</b> <i>fought in Ancient Greece</i>.</li>

	<li><b>For the first time</b> <i>Anne Marie felt frightened</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The repetition of an event or situation that has not happened for a long time can be indicated by using 'for the first time' with 'in' and the plural form of a general time word.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>Diesel is cheaper than petrol in Britain</i> <b>for the first time in years</b>.</li>
	<li><i>You're alone</i> <b>for the first time in months</b>.</li>

<ul>
	<li><i>Don't do it again. I mightn't forgive you</i> <b>next time</b>.</li>
	<li><b>The next time</b> <i>I come here, I'm going to be better</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The use of 'next' with statements referring to the future is described in paragraph <b>5.62</b>.</p>
<p>The most recent occurrence of an event can be indicated by using 'last' as an adverb or the noun groups 'last time' or 'the last time'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>He seemed to have grown a lot since he</i> <b>last</b> <i>wore it</i>.</li>
	<li><i>He could not remember when he had</i> <b>last</b> <i>eaten</i>.</li>
	<li><i>When did you</i> <b>last</b> <i>see him?</i></li>
	<li><i>You did so well</i> <b>last time</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The final occurrence can be indicated by 'for the last time'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>For the last time</b> <i>he waved to the three friends who watched from above</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The use of 'last' in statements about the past is described in paragraph <b>5.41</b>.</p>
<p>You can also use 'before', 'again', and noun groups with an <b>ordinal</b> and 'time' to say whether an event is a first occurrence, or one that has happened before.</p>
<p>You can use 'before' with a perfect tense to indicate whether something is happening for the first time or is a repeated occurrence.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>I've never been in a policeman's house</i> <b>before</b>.</li>
	<li><i>He's done it</i> <b>before</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The adverb 'again' can be used to indicate a second or subsequent occurrence of an event. Ordinals can be used with 'time', in noun groups or in more formal prepositional phrases with 'for', to specify a particular occurrence of a repeated event.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>Someone rang the front door bell. He stood and listened and heard it ring</i> <b>again</b> <i>and then</i> <b>a third time</b>.</li>
	<li><i>'We have no reliable information about that yet,' he found himself saying</i> <b>for the third time</b>.</li>
