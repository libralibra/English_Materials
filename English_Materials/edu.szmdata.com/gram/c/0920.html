<p class="subTitle">5.134 approximate duration</p>
<p>If you want to be less precise about how long something lasts, you can use one of the following approximating adverbs or approximating expressions: 'about', 'almost', 'nearly', 'around', 'more than', 'less than', and so on.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>The family had controlled the time for</i> <b>more than</b> <i>a century</i>.</li>
	<li><i>They have not been allowed to form unions for</i> <b>almost</b> <i>a decade</i>.</li>
	<li><i>The three of us travelled around together for</i> <b>about</b> <i>a month that summer</i>.</li>
	<li><i>In</i> <b>less than</b> <i>a year, I learned enough Latin to pass the entrance exam</i>.</li>
	<li><i>He had been in command of HMS Churchill for</i> <b>nearly</b> <i>a year</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>When making a general statement about the duration of something, you can indicate the maximum period of time that it will last or take by using 'up to'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>Refresher training for</i> <b>up to</b> <i>one month each year was the rule for all</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also use expressions such as 'or so', 'or more', 'or less', 'or thereabouts' to make the duration less specific.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>He has been writing about tennis and golf for forty years</i> <b>or so</b>.</li>
	<li><i>Our species probably practised it for a million years</i> <b>or more</b>.</li>
	<li><i>...hopes which have prevailed so strongly for a century</i> <b>or more</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>'Almost', 'about', 'nearly', and 'thereabouts' are also used when talking about when an event takes place; see paragraph <b>5.99</b> for details of this.</p>
