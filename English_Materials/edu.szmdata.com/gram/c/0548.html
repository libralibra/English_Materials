<p class="subTitle">3.163 verbs of causing</p>
<p>If you want to say that someone or something causes a person or thing to have a particular quality, you can use one of a group of transitive verbs, with an adjective as the complement.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>He said waltzes</i> <b>made him dizzy</b>.</li>
	<li><i>They'</i><b>re driving me crazy</b>.</li>
	<li><i>Then his captor</i> <b>had knocked him unconscious</b>.</li>
	<li><i>She</i> <b>painted her eyelids deep blue</b>.</li>
	<li><i>He</i> <b>wiped the bottle dry</b> <b>with a dishcloth</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is a list of verbs which can be used in this way:</p>
<ul>
	<li class="c_list"><b>cut, drive, get, knock, make, paint, pat, pick, plane, render, rub, send, shoot, sweep, turn, wipe</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Most of these verbs can have only one adjective or a very small range of adjectives as their complement. However 'make' and 'render' can be used with a wide range of adjectives.</p>
