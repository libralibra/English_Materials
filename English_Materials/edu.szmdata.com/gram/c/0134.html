<p class="subTitle">1.150 Asking questions: interrogative pronouns</p>
<p>One way of asking questions is by using an <b>interrogative pronoun</b>.</p>
<p>The interrogative pronouns are 'who', 'whose', 'whom', 'what', and 'which'. They can be used as the subject or object of a clause, or as the object of a preposition. Other words, such as 'where', 'when', 'why', and 'how', can also be used to ask questions.</p>
<p>Interrogative pronouns are not used as the indirect object of a clause.</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Who</b> <i>was at the door?</i></li>
	<li><i>'There's a car outside'</i> <b>'Whose</b> <i>is it?'</i></li>
	<li><i>'A duel, Pa?</i> <b>Whom</b> <i>did he fight?'</i></li>
	<li><b>What</b> <i>are you doing?</i></li>
	<li><b>Which</b> <i>came first, the chicken or the egg?</i></li>
</ul>
<p>For more information about structures in which interrogative pronouns are used, see paragraphs <b>4.10 to 4.30</b>.</p>
<p class="clgm_hw">1.151</p>
<p>Interrogative pronouns refer to the information you are asking for.</p>
<p>'Who', 'whose', and 'whom' are used when you think that the answer to the question will be a person.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>'He lost his wife.' '</i><b>Who?</b> <i>Terry?'</i></li>
	<li><i>He looked at the cat. '</i><b>Whose</b> <i>is it? Have you ever seen it before?'</i></li>
	<li><i>'To</i> <b>whom</b>, <i>if I may ask, are you engaged to be married?' 'To Daniel Orton.'</i></li>
</ul>
<p>'Which' and 'what' are used when you think that the answer to the question will be something other than a person.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>'Is there really a difference?</i> <b>Which</b> <i>do you prefer?'</i></li>
	<li><b>'What</b> <i>did he want?' 'Maurice's address.'</i></li>
</ul>
