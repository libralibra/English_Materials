<p class="subTitle">1.85 use of hyphens</p>
<p>Some compound nouns are written with hyphens instead of spaces between the words.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>The only experience I've got of foreign languages is</i> <b>pen-friends</b>.</li>
	<li><i>Can't you find a</i> <b>baby-sitter</b> <i>and come over for dinner?</i></li>
	<li><i>Judy's elder</i> <b>brother-in-law</b> <i>lived with his family</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some are written with either a hyphen or a space between the words. For example, both 'air-conditioner' and 'air conditioner' are widely used.</p>
<p>A few compound nouns which consist of more than two words are written partly with hyphens and partly with spaces, for example 'back-seat driver' and 'bring-and-buy sale'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>...children from</i> <b>one-parent families</b>.</li>
	<li><i>Another route is by active participation in a</i> <b>Parent-Teacher Association</b>.</li>
</ul>
