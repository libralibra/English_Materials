<p class="subTitle">4.177 Making an offer or an invitation</p>
<p>Modals are often used to make an offer or an invitation.</p>
<p>You use 'will' or 'would' with 'you' to ask someone to accept something, or to make an invitation.</p>
<p>You use 'can', 'may', 'shall', or 'should' with 'I' or 'we' when you are offering to help someone.</p>
<p>Some of these structures are similar to those described in the previous section.</p>
