<p class="subTitle">8.36 putting the verb first</p>
<p>In formal or literary English, if the first verb in an 'if'-clause is 'should', 'were', or 'had', this verb is sometimes put at the beginning of the clause and 'if' is omitted. For example, instead of saying 'If any visitors should come, I will say you are not here', someone might say 'Should any visitors come, I will say you are not here'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Should</b> <i>ministers decide to instigate an inquiry, we would welcome it</i>.</li>
	<li><b>Were</b> <i>it all true, it would still not excuse their actions</i>.</li>
	<li><b>Were</b> <i>they to cease advertising, prices would be significantly reduced</i>.</li>
	<li><b>Had</b> <i>I known that there was never to be another opportunity, I would have filmed the occasion</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p class="clgm_hw">8.37</p>
<p>Instead of using a conditional clause containing the word 'be', you can often use a phrase consisting of 'if' followed by an adjective or a prepositional phrase. For example, instead of saying 'We will sell the car, if it is necessary', you can say 'We will sell the car, if necessary'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>This unfortunate situation is to be avoided</i> <b>if possible</b>.</li>
	<li><i>If I were innocent, I'd rather be tried here</i>; <b>if guilty</b>, <i>in America</i>.</li>
	<li><b>If in doubt</b>, <i>ask at your local library</i>.</li>
</ul>
