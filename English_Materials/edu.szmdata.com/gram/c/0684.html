<p class="subTitle">4.108 contractions</p>
<p>In spoken English, when 'will' and 'would' are used after a pronoun, they are often shortened to '-'ll' and '-'d' and added to the pronoun.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>I hope you</i><b>'ll</b> <i>agree</i>.</li>
	<li><i>She</i><b>'ll</b> <i>be all right</i>.</li>
	<li><i>They</i><b>'d</b> <i>both call each other horrible names</i>.</li>
	<li><i>If I went back on the train, it</i><b>'d</b> <i>be better</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>'Will' and 'would' cannot be shortened like this when they are used on their own, without a following verb. For example, you can say 'Paul said he would come, and I hope he will', but you cannot say 'Paul said he would come, and I hope he'll'.</p>
