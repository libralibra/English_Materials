<p class="subTitle">2.211 Talking about amounts of things: other partitives</p>
<p>When you want to talk about a particular quantity of something, you can use a <b>partitive</b> structure which consists of a particular partitive linked by 'of' to another noun. The partitives are all count nouns.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>Who owns this</i> <b>bit of</b> <i>land?</i></li>
	<li><i></i>...<b>portions of</b> <i>mashed potato</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the partitive is singular, then the verb used with it is usually singular. If it is plural, the verb is also plural.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>A piece of paper</i> <b>is</b> <i>lifeless</i>.</li>
	<li><i>Two pieces of metal</i> <b>were</b> <i>being rubbed together</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that all partitives consist of two or more words, because 'of' is needed in every case, and is printed in the lists below as a reminder.</p>
