<p class="subTitle">4.170 requests: 'may' and 'might'</p>
<p>'May' and 'might' are more formal than 'can' and 'could'. Learners used to be taught that, when asking for something, it was correct to say 'may' rather than 'can', and 'might' rather than 'could'. However 'can' and 'could' are now generally used. Requests beginning with 'might' are unusual, and are considered by most people to be old-fashioned.</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>May</b> <i>I have a cigarette?</i></li>
	<li><b>May</b> <i>we have something to eat?</i></li>
	<li><b>May</b> <i>I ask what your name is?</i></li>
	<li><b>Might</b> <i>I inquire if you are the owner?</i></li>
</ul>
