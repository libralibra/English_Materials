<p class="subTitle">1.221 The general way: other determiners</p>
<p>'Some' is usually used to indicate that there is a quantity of something or that there are a number of things or people, without being precise. It is therefore used with uncount nouns and plural count nouns.</p>
<p>'Some' is usually used in affirmative statements.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>There is</i> <b>some</b> <i>evidence that the system works</i>.</li>
	<li><i>There's</i> <b>some</b> <i>chocolate cake over there</i>.</li>
	<li><i>I had</i> <b>some</b> <i>good ideas</i>.</li>
	<li><b>Some</b> <i>people expect rapid economic development</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>'Some' can be used in questions, when we expect the answer to be 'yes'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>Could you give me</i> <b>some</b> <i>examples?</i></li>
	<li><i>Would you like</i> <b>some</b> <i>coffee?</i></li>
</ul>
<p>'Some' is also used to mean quite a large amount or number. For example, in 'I did not meet her again for some years', 'some' means almost the same as 'several' or 'many'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>You will be unable to restart the car for</i> <b>some</b> <i>time</i>.</li>
	<li><i>It took</i> <b>some</b> <i>years for Dan to realize the truth</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p class="clgm_hw">1.222</p>
<p>You can also use 'some' in front of numbers, in slightly more literary English, to show that you are not being totally accurate.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>I was</i> <b>some</b> <i>fifteen miles by sea from the nearest village</i>.</li>
	<li><i>...an animal weighing</i> <b>some</b> <i>five tons</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p class="clgm_hw">1.223</p>
<p>When you want to emphasize that you do not know the identity of a person or thing, or you think their identity is not important, you can use 'some' with a singular count noun, instead of 'a' or 'an'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>Most staff members will spend a few weeks in</i> <b>some</b> <i>developing country</i>.</li>
	<li><i>Supposing you had</i> <b>some</b> <i>eccentric who came and offered you a thousand pounds</i>.</li>
</ul>
