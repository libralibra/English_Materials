<p class="subTitle">8.47 finite clauses</p>
<p><b>Finite purpose clauses</b> usually begin with 'in order that', 'so that', or 'so'. They usually contain a <b>modal</b>.</p>
<p>If the verb in the main clause is in a <b>present tense</b> or in the <b>present perfect tense</b>, you usually use one of the modals 'can', 'may', 'will', or 'shall' in the purpose clause.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>It's best to be as short, clear and factual as possible</i>, <b>in order that</b> <i>there</i> <b>may</b> <i>be no misunderstanding</i>.</li>
	<li><i>...people who are learning English</i> <b>in order that</b> <i>they</i> <b>can</b> <i>study a particular subject</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the verb in the main clause is in a <b>past tense</b>, you usually use 'could', 'might', 'should', or 'would' in the purpose clause.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>A stranger in the crowd had hoisted Philip up on his shoulder</i> <b>so that</b> <i>he</i> <b>might</b> <i>see the procession depart</i>.</li>
	<li><i>I bought six cows</i> <b>so that</b> <i>we</i> <b>should</b> <i>have some milk to sell</i>.</li>
	<li><i>She said she wanted tea ready at six</i> <b>so</b> <i>she</i> <b>could</b> <i>be out by eight</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ordinary verbs are occasionally used instead of modals, especially in negative purpose clauses.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>Brian would like to increase his son David's wage</i>, <b>so that</b> <i>David</i> <b>doesn't get</b> <i>disillusioned because his contemporaries in less skilled jobs are earning more</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>'So that' is also used in <b>result clauses</b>. This use is explained in paragraphs <b>8.55</b> and <b>8.56</b>.</p>
<p class="clgm_hw">8.48</p>
<p>In formal or old-fashioned English, 'lest' is sometimes used at the beginning of a finite purpose clause to say what an action is intended to prevent.</p>
<p>For example, 'They built a statue of him lest people should forget what he had done' means the same as 'They built a statue of him so that people would not forget what he had done'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>He was put in a cell with no clothes and shoes</i> <b>lest</b> <i>he injure himself</i>.</li>
	<li><i>He spoke in whispers</i> <b>lest</b> <i>the servants should hear him</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>In clauses beginning with 'lest', you use either the <b>subjunctive mood</b>or a <b>modal</b>.</p>
