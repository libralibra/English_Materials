<p class="subTitle">4.95 Using modals</p>
<p>Language is not always used just to exchange information by making simple statements and asking questions. Sometimes we want to make requests, offers, or suggestions, or to express our wishes or intentions. We may want to be polite or tactful, or to indicate our feelings about what we are saying.</p>
<p>We can do all these things by using a special set of verbs called <b>modals</b>. Modals are always used with other verbs. They are a special kind of <b>auxiliary verb</b>.</p>
<p>Here is a list of the modals used in English:</p>
<ul>
	<li class="c_list"><b>can, could, may, might, must, ought to, shall, should, will, would</b></li>
</ul>
<p>In some grammars, 'dare', 'need', and 'used to' are also referred to as modals. In this grammar, we call these words <b>semi-modals</b>. They are dealt with separately in paragraphs <b>4.252 to 4.262</b>.</p>
<p>'Ought' is sometimes regarded as a modal, rather than 'ought to'. For a further note about this, see paragraph <b>4.102</b>.</p>
<p>Modals are sometimes called 'modal verbs' or 'modal auxiliaries'.</p>
<p class="clgm_hw">4.96</p>
<p>The main uses of modals are explained in paragraphs <b>4.97</b> to <b>4.101</b>. Special features of modals are described in paragraphs <b>4.102</b> to <b>4.109</b>.</p>
<p>Ways of referring to time when using modals are explained in paragraphs <b>4.110</b> to <b>4.117</b>. Ways of using modals to say whether something is possible are explained in paragraphs <b>4.118 to 4.157</b>. Ways of using modals when interacting with other people are explained in paragraphs <b>4.158 to 4.226</b>.</p>
<p>Expressions which can be used instead of modals are described in paragraphs <b>4.227</b> to <b>4.251</b>. <b>Semi-modals</b> are explained in paragraphs <b>4.252</b> to <b>4.262</b>.</p>
