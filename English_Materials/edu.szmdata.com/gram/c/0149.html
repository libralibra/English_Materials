<p class="subTitle">1.171 referring back</p>
<p>In each of the preceding paragraphs showing uses of 'the' and a noun, it is possible to understand who or what is being referred to because the noun group is commonly accepted as referring to one particular person, thing, or group.</p>
<p>However, you can use 'the' with any noun, if it is obvious who or what you are referring to from what has already been said or written. For example, if you have already mentioned that you have seen a mouse, you can say afterwards 'We tried to catch the mouse'.</p>
