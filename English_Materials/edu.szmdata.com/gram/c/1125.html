<p class="subTitle">8.49 Reason clauses</p>
<p>When you want to indicate the reason for something, you use a <b>reason clause</b>.</p>
<p>Here is a list of the main conjunctions used in reason clauses:</p>
<ul>
	<li class="c_list"><b>as, because, in case, just in case, since</b></li>
</ul>
<p class="clgm_hw">8.50</p>
<p>If you are simply indicating the reason for something, you use 'because', 'since', or 'as'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>I couldn't feel anger against him</i> <b>because</b> <i>I liked him too much</i>.</li>
	<li><i>I didn't know that she had been married</i>, <b>since</b> <i>she seldom talked about herself</i>.</li>
	<li><b>As</b> <i>Celia had gone to school, it seemed a good time for Lady Ravenscroft to invite her sister to stay</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p class="clgm_hw">8.51</p>
<p>You use 'in case' or 'just in case' when you are mentioning a possible future situation which is someone's reason for doing something. In the reason clause, you use the <b>simple present tense</b>.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>Mr Woods, I am here</i> <b>just in case</b> <i>anything out of the ordinary</i> <b>happens</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>When you are talking about someone's reason for doing something in the past, you use the <b>simple past tense</b> in the reason clause.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>Sam had consented to take an overcoat</i> <b>in case</b> <i>the wind</i> <b>rose</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p class="clgm_hw">8.52</p>
<p>'In that', 'inasmuch as', 'insofar as', and 'to the extent that' are used to say why a statement you have just made is true. These are formal expressions.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>I'm in a difficult situation</i> <b>in that</b> <i>I have been offered two jobs and they both sound interesting</i>.</li>
	<li><i>Censorship is feeble</i> <b>inasmuch as</b> <i>it does not protect anyone</i>.</li>
	<li><i>We are traditional</i> <b>insofar as</b> <i>we do traditional sketches, but we try and do them about original ideas</i>.</li>
	<li><i>He feels himself to be dependent</i> <b>to the extent that</b> <i>he is not free to question decisions affecting his daily life</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p class="clgm_hw">8.53</p>
<p>People sometimes use reason clauses beginning with 'for' or 'seeing that'. 'For' means the same as 'because'. Its use in reason clauses is now considered to be old-fashioned.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>We never see Henry these days</i>, <b>for</b> <i>Henry has grown fat and lazy</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>'Seeing that' means the same as 'since'. It is used only in informal speech.</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Seeing that</b> <i>you're the guest on this little trip, I won't tell you what you what I think of your behaviour last night</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>'Now' and 'now that' are used to say that a new situation is the reason for something. Clauses beginning with 'now' or 'now that' are dealt with as <b>time clauses</b>. They are explained in paragraph <b>8.18</b>.</p>
