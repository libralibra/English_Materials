<p class="subTitle">3.1 Making a message</p>
<p>When you make a statement, you use a <b>clause</b>. A clause which is used to make a statement contains a <b>noun group</b>, which refers to the person or thing that you are talking about, and a <b>verb group</b>, which indicates what sort of action, process, or state you are talking about.</p>
<p>The noun group, which usually comes in front of the verb group, is called the <b>subject</b> of the verb or the clause. For example, in the clause 'Ellen laughed', 'Ellen' is the subject. The formation of noun groups has been explained in Chapters 1 and 2.</p>
<p>A verb group used in a statement is <b>finite</b>. The elements of a finite verb group and their form depend on what tense you want to use and whether one person or thing is performing the action, or more than one.  Quite often in statements the verb group is a single word, and it is quite common to talk about the 'verb' of a clause.</p>
<p>When you say something, you can be talking about an action that involves one or more participants. Indicating participants in a clause is called <b>transitivity</b>. See paragraphs <b>3.2 to 3.126</b>. You can also be describing someone or something, or saying that they are a particular thing. Describing and identifying things is called <b>complementation</b>. See paragraphs <b>3.127 to 3.182</b>. A third kind of statement involves talking about two actions that are closely linked. This is called <b>phase</b>. See paragraphs <b>3.183 to 3.213</b>.</p>
<p>Although this chapter mainly describes finite clauses, the information that it gives about transitivity and complementation also applies to <b>non-finite clauses</b>, that is, clauses whose verb is an infinitive or a participle. Non-finite verb groups can be followed by objects, adjuncts, and complements, just as finite verb groups can.</p>
<p>This chapter deals mainly with the use of verbs in <b>active</b> clauses, where the subject is the performer of an action rather than the person or thing affected by an action. The use of verbs in <b>passive</b> clauses, where the subject is the person or thing affected, is explained in paragraphs <b>10.8 to 10.24</b>.</p>
