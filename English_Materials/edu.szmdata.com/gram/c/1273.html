<p class="subTitle">9.61 USAGE NOTE</p>
<p>You can omit a verb after the semi-modals 'dare' and 'need', but only when they are used in the negative.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>'I don't mind telling you what I know.' --- 'You</i> <b>needn't</b>. <i>I'm not asking you for it.'</i></li>
	<li><i>'You must tell her the truth.' --- 'But, Neill, I</i> <b>daren't.'</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Similarly, the verb is only omitted after the modal expressions 'had rather' and 'would rather' when they are used in the negative. However, the verb is sometimes omitted after 'had better' even when it is used affirmatively.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>'Will she be happy there?' --- 'She</i><b>'d better.'</b></li>
	<li><i>It's just that I</i><b>'d rather</b> <i>not</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p class="clgm_hw">9.62</p>
<p>Ellipsis also occurs with 'to'-infinitive clauses. Instead of using a full 'to'-infinitive clause after a verb, you can just use 'to', if the action or state has already been mentioned.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>Don't tell me if you don't want</i> <b>to</b>.</li>
	<li><i>At last he agreed to do what I asked him</i> <b>to</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also do this in conversation.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>'Do you ever visit a doctor?' I asked her. --- 'No. We can't afford</i> <b>to.'</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Note that there are some verbs, such as 'try' and 'ask', which are also often used on their own, without 'to'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>They couldn't help each other, and it was ridiculous to</i> <b>try</b>.</li>
	<li><i>Some water boards will replace washers free of charge, if you</i> <b>ask</b>.</li>
</ul>
