<p class="subTitle">1.231 'more', 'few', 'less'</p>
<p>There are three comparatives that are determiners. 'More' is used in front of plural and uncount nouns, usually with 'than', to refer to a quantity or amount of something that is greater than another quantity or amount.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>He does</i> <b>more</b> <i>hours than I do</i>.</li>
	<li><i>His visit might do</i> <b>more</b> <i>harm than good</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>But 'more' is also often used to refer to an additional quantity of something rather than in comparisons.</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>More</b> <i>officers will be brought in as and when circumstances dictate</i>.</li>
	<li><i>We need</i> <b>more</b> <i>information</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>'Less' is used to refer to an amount of something that is smaller than another amount. 'Fewer' is used to refer to a group of things that is smaller than another group. 'Less' is usually used before uncount nouns and 'fewer' before plural nouns, but in informal English 'less' is also used before plural nouns.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>The poor have</i> <b>less</b> <i>access to education</i>.</li>
	<li><i>...machinery which uses</i> <b>less</b> <i>energy</i>.</li>
	<li><i>As a result, he found</i> <b>less</b> <i>time than he would have hoped for his hobbies</i>.</li>
	<li><i>There are</i> <b>fewer</b> <i>trees here</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>For more information about <b>comparison</b>, see paragraphs <b>2.108 to 2.144</b>.</p>
