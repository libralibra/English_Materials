<p class="subTitle">1.141 Showing that two people do the same thing: reciprocal pronouns</p>
<p>The <b>reciprocal pronouns</b> 'each other' and 'one another' are used to indicate that people do the same thing, feel the same way, or have the same relationship.</p>
<p>For example, if your brother hates your sister and your sister hates your brother, you can say 'My brother and sister hate each other' or 'They hate one another'.</p>
<p>Reciprocal pronouns are not used as the subject of a clause. You can use them as the object or indirect object of a verb.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>We help</i> <b>each other</b> <i>a lot</i>.</li>
	<li><i>You and I understand</i> <b>each other</b>.</li>
	<li><i>I listened to the stags answering</i> <b>one another</b> <i>from hill to hill</i>.</li>
	<li><i>They sent</i> <b>each other</b> <i>gifts from time to time</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also use them as the object of a preposition.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>Terry and Mark were jealous of</i> <b>each other</b>.</li>
	<li><i>...two lights moving towards</i> <b>one another</b>.</li>
	<li><i>They didn't dare to look at</i> <b>one another</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some verbs are very commonly used with reciprocal pronouns. For more information about these, see paragraphs <b>3.69 to 3.73</b>.</p>
<p class="clgm_hw">1.142</p>
<p>Note that there is very little difference between 'each other' and 'one another'. They can both be used to refer to two or more people or things, although some teachers prefer the use of 'each other' when there are only two people or things, and 'one another' when there are more than two.</p>
