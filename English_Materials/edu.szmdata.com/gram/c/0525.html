<p class="subTitle">3.135 USAGE NOTE</p>
<p>Some verbs in the second group listed above have special features.</p>
<p>'Appear', 'prove', and 'seem' are often followed by 'to be' and a complement, instead of directly by a complement.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>Mary was breathing quietly and</i> <b>seemed to be asleep</b>.</li>
	<li><i>The task of inspecting it</i> <b>proved to be exacting and interesting</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>See paragraph <b>3.193</b> for information on using a 'to'-infinitive clause after these verbs.</p>
<p class="clgm_hw">3.136</p>
<p>With some of the second group, especially 'feel', 'look', and 'seem', you can use the <b>past participle</b> of a transitive verb as a complement.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>The other child looked</i> <b>neglected</b>.</li>
	<li><i>The quarrel of the night before seemed</i> <b>forgotten</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p class="clgm_hw">3.137</p>
<p>When you are using the second group of verbs to say what qualities someone or something seems to have, you may want to mention the person whose viewpoint you are giving. You can do this using a prepositional phrase beginning with 'to'. It usually comes after the complement.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>They looked all right</i> <b>to me</b>.</li>
	<li><i>It sounds unnatural</i> <b>to you</b>, <i>I expect</i>.</li>
</ul>
