<p class="subTitle">5.89 years, decades, and centuries</p>
<p>Years are referred to in English by numbers.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>...the eleventh of January</i>, <b>1967</b>.</li>
	<li><i>A second conference was held in February</i> <b>1988</b>.</li>
	<li><i>My mother died in</i> <b>1945</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>To refer to periods longer than a year, decades (ten years) and centuries (a hundred years) are used. Decades start with a year ending in zero and finish with a year ending in nine: 'the 1960s' (1960 to 1969), 'the 1820's' (1820 to 1829). If the century is already known, it can be omitted: 'the 20s', 'the twenties', 'the Twenties'.</p>
<p>To be more specific, for example in historical dates, 'AD' is added before or after the numbers for years or centuries after Christ is believed to have been born: '1650 AD', 'AD 1650', 'AD 1650-53', '1650-53 AD'. 'BC' is added after the numbers for years or centuries before Christ is believed to have been born: '1500 BC', '12-1500 BC'.</p>
<p>Centuries start with a year ending in two zeroes and finish with a year ending in two nines. Ordinals are used to refer to them. The 'first century' was from '0 AD' to '99 AD', the 'second century' was '100-199 AD', and so on, so the period '1800-1899 AD' was the 'nineteenth century' and we are currently in the 'twentieth century' (1900-1999 AD). Centuries can also be written using numbers: 'the 20th century'.</p>
