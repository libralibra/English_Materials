<p class="subTitle">4.3 mood</p>
<p>Often it is the order of words which indicates which way a sentence is being used. For example, if you say 'He is Norwegian', the word order makes it clear that you are making a statement. If you say 'Is he Norwegian?', the word order indicates that you are asking a question.</p>
<p>Another way of indicating which way a sentence is being used is to begin it with a verb, rather than with the subject. For example, if you say 'Give this book to Michael', it is clear that you are giving an order or instruction, rather than making a statement or asking a question.</p>
<p>These ways of distinguishing between uses of language are examples of <b>mood</b>. The main clause of every sentence is in a particular <b>mood</b>.</p>
