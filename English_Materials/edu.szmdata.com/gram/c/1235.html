<p class="subTitle">9.17 manner</p>
<p>After describing a way of doing something or a way in which something happens, you can refer back to it using the adverb 'thus'. 'Thus' is a formal word.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>Eventually with a groan of good nature he gave in. There was, as a matter of fact, even something pleasing to him in</i> <b>thus</b> <i>giving in</i>.</li>
	<li><i>It not only pleased him to work with them, but the few pence</i> <b>thus</b> <i>earned gave him an enormous sense of importance</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that 'in this way' or 'in that way' are commonly used instead.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>More and more people will turn to cheques and credit cards for the majority of their purchases. Many people in the Western world already do the bulk of their purchasing</i> <b>in this way</b>.</li>
</ul>
