<p class="subTitle">2.319 apposition</p>
<p>When you want to give further information about someone or something by using a noun group which describes them or identifies them, you can put this noun group after the headword. This is often called <b>apposition</b>. The use of noun groups in apposition is closely associated with defining and non-defining relative clauses which is explained in paragraphs <b>8.83 to 8.111</b>.</p>
<p class="clgm_hw">2.320</p>
<p>If you put this noun group after the main noun group, a comma is almost always put after the main noun group because the second noun group is separate from it, not part of it.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>...the sifaka</i>, <b>a beautiful creature with pure white fur</b>.</li>
	<li><i>...Orville Wright</i>, <b>the first man to fly</b>.</li>
	<li><i>...Dan Melnick</i>, <b>the head of MGM</b>.</li>
	<li><i>...Steve Race</i>, <b>the musician and broadcaster</b>.</li>
	<li><i>Her mother</i>, <b>a Canadian</b>, <i>died when she was six</i>.</li>
	<li><i>...a book by a distinguished Scotsman</i>, <b>Ramsey Weir</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you put this noun group before the main noun group, you can choose whether to use a comma separate the two noun groups or not.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>...the American writer Alvin Toffler</i>.</li>
	<li><i>...Joan's husband</i>, <b>Jim Inglis</b>.</li>
</ul>
