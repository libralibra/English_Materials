<p class="subTitle">8.105 defining clauses</p>
<p>'When' and 'where' can also be used in <b>defining clauses</b>, but only when the clause is preceded by a particular kind of noun.</p>
<p>'When'-clauses must be preceded by the word 'time' or by the name of a period of time such as 'day' or 'year'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>There had been</i> <b>a time when</b> <i>she thought they were wonderful</i>.</li>
	<li><i>This is</i> <b>the year when</b> <i>the profits should start</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>'Where'-clauses must be preceded by the word 'place' or by the name of a place such as 'room' or 'street'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i></i>...<b>the place where</b> <i>they work</i>.</li>
	<li><i></i>...<b>the room where</b> <i>I did my homework</i>.</li>
	<li><i></i>...<b>the street where</b> <i>my grandmother had lived</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that place-names such as 'London' are <b>proper nouns</b> and so do not have defining relative clauses after them.</p>
