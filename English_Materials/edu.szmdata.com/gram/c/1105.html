<p class="subTitle">8.20 saying when a situation ends</p>
<p>If you want to say that a situation stopped when something happened, you use 'until' or 'till'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>I stayed there talking to them</i> <b>until</b> <i>I saw Sam Ward leave the building</i>.</li>
	<li><i>He grabbed me and shook me</i> <b>till</b> <i>my teeth rattled</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>You also use 'until' or 'till' to say that a situation will stop when something happens in the future. In the time clause you use the <b>simple present tense</b> or the <b>present perfect tense</b>.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>Stay with me</i> <b>until</b> <i>I</i> <b>go</b>.</li>
	<li><i>We'll support them</i> <b>till</b> <i>they</i> <b>find</b> <i>work</i>.</li>
	<li><i>Tell him I won't discuss anything</i> <b>until</b> <i>I</i><b>'ve spoken</b> <i>to my wife</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p class="clgm_hw">8.21</p>
<p>'By which time', 'at which point', 'after which', 'whereupon', and 'upon which' are also used at the beginning of time clauses.</p>
<p>You use 'by which time' to say that something had already happened or will already have happened before the event you have just mentioned.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>He came back eight months later</i>, <b>by which time</b> <i>the Japanese had decided to say yes</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>You use 'at which point' to say that something happened immediately after the event you have just mentioned.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>Later, service trades such as toolmaking and blacksmithing appeared</i>, <b>at which point</b> <i>the simple swapping of produce was no longer feasible</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>You use 'after which' to say that a situation started to exist or will start to exist after the event you have just mentioned.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>The clothes were sent away for chemical analysis</i>, <b>after which</b> <i>they were never seen again</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>You use 'whereupon' or 'upon which' to say that something happened immediately after the event you have just mentioned and was a result of it.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>His department was shut down</i>, <b>whereupon</b> <i>he returned to Calcutta</i>.</li>
	<li><i>Sally more or less implied that we did</i>, <b>upon which</b> <i>Howard flew into a great rage</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p class="clgm_hw">8.22</p>
<p>You can use a clause beginning with 'when' after a question beginning with 'why'. For example, you can say 'Why should I help her when she never helps me?' However this clause is not a time clause. In your question, you are expressing surprise or disagreement at something that has been said, and the 'when'-clause indicates the reason for your surprise or disagreement.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>Why should he do me an injury</i> <b>when</b> <i>he has already saved my life?</i></li>
	<li><i>Why worry her</i> <b>when</b> <i>it's all over?</i></li>
</ul>
