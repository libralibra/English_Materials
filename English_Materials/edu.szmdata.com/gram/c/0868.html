<p class="subTitle">5.69 Timing by adjuncts</p>
<p>In many statements, it is the adjunct rather than the tense of the verb which carries the time reference. For this reason, many adjuncts can be used with more than one set of tenses, because they refer to time and not to tense.</p>
<p>For example, a common use is to put adjuncts which normally refer to future time with the present tense when it is used to refer to future actions, including habitual actions. They can also be used with references to the future that are made in the past.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>West Germany</i> <b>celebrates</b> <i>its fortieth birthday</i> <b>tomorrow</b>.</li>
	<li><i>After all, you</i><b>'re coming</b> <i>back</i> <b>next week</b>.</li>
	<li><i>The farmer just laughed and rode away. So</i> <b>the next week I tried</b> <i>my luck at another farm</i>.</li>
	<li><i>We</i> <b>arranged</b> <i>to meet</i> <b>in three week's time</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The adjuncts 'now', 'today', 'tonight' and those involving 'this' refer to a period of time which includes the present moment. They are used fairly commonly with all tenses. This is because an event can be located before, during, or after the time specified by the tense of the verb.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>I was</i> <b>now</b> <i>in a Scottish regiment</i>.</li>
	<li><i>Your boss will</i> <b>now</b> <i>have no alternative but to go to his superiors and explain the situation</i>.</li>
	<li><i>One of my children wrote to me</i> <b>today</b>.</li>
	<li><i>I will ski no more</i> <b>today</b>.</li>
	<li><i>It's dark</i> <b>today</b>.</li>
	<li><i>'I went to the doctor</i> <b>this morning,'</b> <i>she said</i>.</li>
	<li><i>He won't be able to fight</i> <b>this Friday</b>.</li>
	<li><i>I'm doing my ironing</i> <b>this afternoon</b>.</li>
</ul>
