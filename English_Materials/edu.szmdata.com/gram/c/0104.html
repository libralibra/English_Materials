<p class="subTitle">1.116 WARNING</p>
<p>Unlike personal pronouns and possessive pronouns, there are two forms of the reflexive pronoun used for the second person. You use 'yourself' when you are talking to one person. You use 'yourselves' when you are talking to more than one person, or referring to a group which includes the person you are talking to.</p>
