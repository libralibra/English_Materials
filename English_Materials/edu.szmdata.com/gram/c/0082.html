<p class="subTitle">1.90 composition of compound nouns</p>
<p>Most compound nouns consist of two nouns, or an adjective and a noun.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>I listened with anticipation to the radio</i> <b>news bulletin</b>.</li>
	<li><i>...a big</i> <b>dining room</b>.</li>
	<li><i>She came in and sat down at the</i> <b>tea-table</b>.</li>
	<li><i>He was still a freshman in the</i> <b>high school</b>, <i>although he was nearly sixteen</i>.</li>
	<li><b>Old age</b> <i>is sickness only if one makes it so</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, a few compound nouns are related to <b>phrasal verbs</b>. These are often written with a hyphen.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>The President was directly involved in a Watergate</i> <b>cover-up</b>.</li>
	<li><i>The registry office is famous for its</i> <b>turn-over</b> <i>of fashionable weddings</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>For more information about phrasal verbs, see paragraphs <b>3.84 to 3.117</b>.</p>
