<p class="subTitle">7.71 referring to the hearer</p>
<p>After some reporting verbs that refer to speech, you have to mention the hearer as a direct object. 'Tell' is the most common of these verbs.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>I told</i> <b>them</b> <i>you were at the dentist</i>.</li>
	<li><i>I informed</i> <b>her</b> <i>that I was unwell and could not come</i>.</li>
	<li><i>Smith persuaded</i> <b>them</b> <i>that they must support the strike</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can use these verbs in the passive, with the hearer as the subject.</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>She had been told</b> <i>she could leave hospital</i>.</li>
	<li><b>Members had been informed</b> <i>that the purpose of the meeting was to elect a new chairman</i>.</li>
	<li><b>She was persuaded</b> <i>to look again</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is a list of reporting verbs which must have the hearer as the direct object when they are used with a 'that'-clause:</p>
<ul>
	<li class="c_list"><b>assure, convince, inform, notify, persuade, reassure, remind, tell</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Here is a list of reporting verbs which must have the hearer as the direct object when they are used with a 'to'-infinitive clause:</p>
