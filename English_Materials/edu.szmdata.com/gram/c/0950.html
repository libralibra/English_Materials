<p class="subTitle">6.30 Comparative and superlative adverbs</p>
<p>You may want to say how something happens or is done in relation to how it happens on a different occasion, or how it was done by someone or something else. You can do this by using adverbs in the <b>comparative</b> or <b>superlative</b>.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>He began to speak</i> <b>more quickly</b>.</li>
	<li><i>Red-legged partridges are</i> <b>most commonly</b> <i>seen in the eastern counties of England</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Most <b>adverbs of manner</b> (see paragraph <b>6.36</b>) have comparatives and superlatives.</p>
<p>A few other adverbs also have comparatives and superlatives: some adverbs of <b>time</b> ('early' and 'late', see paragraph <b>5.70</b>), <b>frequency</b> ('often' and 'frequently', see paragraph <b>5.114</b>), <b>duration</b> ('briefly', 'permanently', and 'long', see paragraph <b>5.123</b>), and some adverbs of <b>place</b> ('near', 'close', 'deep', 'high', 'far', and 'low', see paragraphs <b>6.68</b> and <b>6.89</b>).</p>
<p class="clgm_hw">6.31</p>
<p>The forms and uses of comparative and superlative adverbs are generally similar to those of adjectives. For more information about comparatives and superlatives of adjectives, see paragraphs <b>2.108 to 2.117</b>.</p>
<p>However, unlike adjectives, the comparative of an adverb is usually formed with 'more' and the superlative with 'most', and not by adding '-er' and '-est'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>The people needed business skills so that they could manage themselves</i> <b>more effectively</b>.</li>
	<li><i>First she might have some useful information</i>. <b>More importantly</b>, <i>a damaging precedent could be set</i>.</li>
	<li><i>...the text which Professor Williams's volume</i> <b>most closely</b> <i>resembles</i>.</li>
	<li><i>For me, Haitink is the conductor who re-writes those maps</i>, <b>most often</b> <i>and</i> <b>most convincingly</b>.</li>
</ul>
