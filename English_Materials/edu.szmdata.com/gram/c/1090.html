<p class="subTitle">7.88 commenting on a fact</p>
<p>If you want to comment on a fact, you can use an adjective describing the fact followed by a 'that'-clause. The link verb has <b>impersonal</b> 'it' as its subject.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>It was sad</i> <b>that people had reacted in the way they did</b>.</li>
	<li><i>It is true</i> <b>that the authority of parliament has declined</b>.</li>
	<li><i>It is extraordinary</i> <b>that we should ever have met!</b></li>
	<li><i>It seems probable</i> <b>that the world can go on producing enough food for everyone</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is a list of adjectives used to comment on facts:</p>
<ul>
	<li class="c_list"><b>apparent, appropriate, awful, bad, clear, essential, evident, fair, funny, good, important, inevitable, interesting, likely, lucky, natural, obvious, plain, possible, true, unlikely</b></li>
</ul>
<p>After a few adjectives, a clause beginning with a 'wh'-word can be used.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>It's funny</i> <b>how they don't get on</b>.</li>
	<li><i>It was never clear</i> <b>why she worked all her life as a domestic servant</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>For more information, see paragraph <b>10.43</b>.</p>
