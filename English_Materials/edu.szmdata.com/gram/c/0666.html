<p class="subTitle">4.88 as first word in the clause</p>
<p>In formal or literary English, a broad negative is sometimes placed at the beginning of a clause for emphasis. If you are using a verb group with an auxiliary, the first word in the verb group is placed after the broad negative, followed by the subject and then the remainder of the verb group.</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Seldom has society offered</b> <i>so wide a range of leisure time activities</i>.</li>
	<li><b>Hardly had we recovered</b> <i>from this appalling shock when we were approached by a yacht</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>If there is no auxiliary, you put the simple present or simple past of 'do' after the broad negative, followed by the subject, followed by the base form of the main verb.</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Seldom did a week pass</b> <i>without a request for assessment</i>.</li>
	<li><b>Rarely do local matches live up to</b> <i>expectations</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that 'barely' and 'scarcely' are not often used in this way.</p>
