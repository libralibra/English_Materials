<p class="subTitle">10.27 other kinds of focus</p>
<p>In a cleft sentence, you usually focus on a noun group. However, you can focus on other clause elements or even on a whole clause. You then use a relative clause beginning with 'that'.</p>
<p>You can make an <b>adjunct</b> the focus of a cleft sentence. For example, you can focus on a prepositional phrase or an adverb of time or place in order to stress the circumstances of an event.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>It was</i> <b>from Francis</b> <i>that she first heard the news</i>.</li>
	<li><i>It was</i> <b>then</b> <i>that I recalled that I had left my wristwatch up in the saloon</i>.</li>
	<li><i>It was</i> <b>in Elliotdale</b> <i>that I first saw these films</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also focus on a <b>non-finite clause</b>, if you are stressing an action.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>It was</i> <b>meeting Peter</b> <i>that really started me off on this new line of work</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can focus on a clause beginning with 'because' to stress the reason for something.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>Perhaps it's</i> <b>because he's a misfit</b> <i>that I get along with him</i>.</li>
</ul>
