<p class="subTitle">1.105 position in clause</p>
<p>Object pronouns are used as the object of a clause.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>The nurse washed</i> <b>me</b> <i>with cold water</i>.</li>
	<li><i>He likes</i> <b>you</b> <i> --- he said so</i>.</li>
	<li><i>The man went up to the cat and started stroking</i> <b>it</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>They can be the indirect object of a clause.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>Send</i> <b>us</b> <i>a card so we'll know where you are</i>.</li>
	<li><i>A man gave</i> <b>him</b> <i>a car</i>.</li>
	<li><i>The children asked Simon if he would give</i> <b>them</b> <i>some money</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>They can also be the object of a preposition.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>There was a humorous article by</i> <b>me</b> <i>on the first page</i>.</li>
	<li><i>Madeleine, I want to talk to</i> <b>you</b> <i>immediately</i>.</li>
	<li><i>We were all sitting in a cafe with</i> <b>him</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p class="clgm_hw">1.106</p>
<p>Object pronouns can also be used after <b>link verbs</b>. For example, you can say 'It was me', 'It's her'. However, in formal or written English, people sometimes use a subject pronoun after a link verb. For example, 'It was I', 'It is she'.</p>
<p>For more information on link verbs, see paragraphs <b>3.127 to 3.182</b>.</p>
