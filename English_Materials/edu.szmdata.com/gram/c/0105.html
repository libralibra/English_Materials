<p class="subTitle">1.117 used as object</p>
<p>You can use a reflexive pronoun to make it clear that the object of a verb is the same person or thing as the subject of the verb, or to emphasize this.</p>
<p>For example, 'John killed himself' means that John did the killing, and he was also the person who was killed.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>He forced</i> <b>himself</b> <i>to lie absolutely still</i>.</li>
	<li><i>She stretched</i> <b>herself</b> <i>out flat on the sofa</i>.</li>
	<li><i>I'm sure history repeats</i> <b>itself</b>.</li>
	<li><i>All of us shook hands and introduced</i> <b>ourselves</b>.</li>
	<li><i>The men formed</i> <b>themselves</b> <i>into a line facing the boys</i>.</li>
	<li><i>...the questions you had to ask</i> <b>yourselves</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also use reflexive pronouns to indicate or emphasize that the indirect object of a verb is the same person or thing as the subject of the verb. For example, in the sentence 'Ann poured herself a drink', Ann did the pouring and she was also the person who the drink was for.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>Here's the money, go and buy</i> <b>yourself</b> <i>a watch</i>.</li>
</ul>
