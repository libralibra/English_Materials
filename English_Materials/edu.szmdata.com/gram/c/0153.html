<p class="subTitle">1.175 modifiers: specifying or expanding</p>
<p>When you use a modifier between 'the' and a noun, you do not always do it in order to make clear who or what is being referred to. There are two other reasons why you might use a modifier.</p>
<p>Firstly, if you have already referred to someone or something using a modifier, you sometimes continue to use the modifier when referring to them again. For example, if you first refer to a car as 'a yellow car', you may continue to refer to it as 'the yellow car', even though no other cars are involved in what you are saying or writing.</p>
<p>Secondly, you might want to add further information about someone or something that you have already mentioned. For example, if you first refer to someone as 'a woman' in a sentence such as 'A woman came into the room', you might later want to refer to her as 'the unfortunate woman' or 'the smiling woman'.</p>
<p>This is a very common use in written English, especially in stories, but it is not often used in conversation.</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>The astonished waiter</b> <i>was now watching from the other end of the room</i>.</li>
	<li><i>You don't want to give</i> <b>the poor man</b> <i>ulcers</i>.</li>
	<li><i>The loss of pressure caused</i> <b>the speeding car</b> <i>to go into a</i> <i>skid</i>.</li>
</ul>
