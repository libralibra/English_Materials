<p class="subTitle">9.4 determiners</p>
<p>Another common way of referring back to something is to use a <b>specific determiner</b> such as 'the' or 'its' in front of a noun.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>A man and a woman were struggling up</i> <b>the</b> <i>dune</i>. <b>The</b> <i>man wore shorts, a T-shirt, basketball sneakers</i>. <b>The</b> <i>woman wore a print dress</i>.</li>
	<li><i>'Thanks,' said Brody. He hung up, turned out the light in</i> <b>his</b> <i>office, and walked out to</i> <b>his</b> <i>car</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Specific determiners are explained in paragraphs <b>1.162 to 1.207</b>.</p>
<p>Some general determiners can also be used to refer back to something.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>A dog was running around in the yard. Soon</i> <b>another</b> <i>dog appeared</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is a list of general determiners used to refer back to something:</p>
<ul>
	<li class="c_list"><b>another, both, each, either, every, neither, other</b></li>
</ul>
<p>These are explained fully in paragraphs <b>1.221 to 1.235</b>.</p>
<p class="clgm_hw">9.5</p>
<p>As indicated above, pronouns and determiners used to refer back are explained in Chapter 1, where other pronouns and determiners are explained. The <b>demonstratives</b> 'this' and 'that' are used to refer back to whole sentences and sections of text as well as to things, so all their cohesive uses are set out in the following section (paragraphs <b>9.7 to 9.17</b>), which also explains other words which are used to refer back in a specific way.</p>
