<p class="subTitle">5.137 Indicating the start or end of a period</p>
<p>You can also indicate how long a situation lasts by using prepositional phrases to give the time when it begins or the time when it ends, or both.</p>
<p>If you want to talk about a situation that began in the past and is continuing now, or to consider a period of it from a time in the past to the present, you use the preposition 'since' with a time expression or an event to indicate when the situation began. The verb should be in the present perfect tense.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>I've been here</i> <b>since twelve o'clock</b>.</li>
	<li><i>I haven't had a new customer in here</i> <b>since Sunday</b>.</li>
	<li><i>Some 850 firemen have been laid off</i> <b>since April</b>.</li>
	<li><i>I haven't been out</i> <b>since Christmas</b>.</li>
	<li><i>He has not won a major championship</i> <b>since 1974</b>.</li>
	<li><i>There has been no word of my friend</i> <b>since the revolution</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>'Since' is also used to indicate the beginning of situations that ended in the past. The verb should be in the past perfect tense.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>I'd been working in London</i> <b>since January</b> <i>at a firm called Kendalls</i>.</li>
	<li><i>He hadn't prayed once</i> <b>since the morning</b>.</li>
	<li><i>I'd only had two sandwiches</i> <b>since breakfast</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>'Since' can also be used with other prepositional phrases that indicate a point in time.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>I haven't seen you</i> <b>since before the summer</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The noun group after 'since' can sometimes refer to a person or thing rather than a time or event, especially when used with a superlative, 'first' or 'only', or with a negative.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>The last government was the greatest tragedy in our history</i> <b>since Henry the Eighth</b>.</li>
	<li><i>I have never had another dog</i> <b>since Jonnie</b>.</li>
</ul>
