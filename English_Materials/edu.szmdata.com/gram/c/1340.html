<p class="subTitle">10.70 generalization</p>
<p>You often want to avoid making a firm, forceful statement, because you are aware of facts that do not quite fit in with what you are saying.</p>
<p>One way of doing this is to use a sentence adjunct which indicates that you are making a general, basic, or approximate statement.</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Basically</b>, <i>the more craters a surface has, the older it is</i>.</li>
	<li><b>By and large</b> <i>the broadcasters were free to treat this material very much as they wished</i>.</li>
	<li><i>I think</i> <b>on the whole</b> <i>we don't do too badly</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following adjuncts are used like this:</p>
<ul>
	<li class="c_list"><b>all in all, all things considered, altogether, as a rule, at a rough estimate, basically, broadly, by and large, essentially, for the most part, fundamentally, generally, in essence, in general, on average, on balance, on the whole, overall, ultimately</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Note that you can also use the expressions 'broadly speaking', 'generally speaking', and 'roughly speaking'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>We are all</i>, <b>broadly speaking</b>, <i>middle class</i>.</li>
	<li><b>Roughly speaking</b>, <i>the problem appears to be confined to the tropics</i>.</li>
</ul>
