<p class="subTitle">1.33 nouns that are uncount and count</p>
<p>There are also some other nouns that can be uncount nouns when they refer to a thing in general, and count nouns when they refer to a particular instance of it.</p>
<p>Some nouns are commonly both uncount nouns and count nouns. For example, 'victory' refers to the idea of winning in general but 'a victory' refers to a particular occasion when someone wins.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>Just as we gained fame in</i> <b>victory</b>, <i>we lost nothing in defeat</i>.</li>
	<li><i>She is still waiting and yearning for</i> <b>her</b> <i>first</i> <b>victory</b>.</li>
	<li><i>Many parents were alarmed to find themselves in open</i> <b>conflict</b> <i>with the church</i>.</li>
	<li><i>Russia had been successful in previous</i> <b>conflicts</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some uncount nouns are rarely or never count nouns; that is, they do not occur in a plural form, or with a number.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>...a collection of fine</i> <b>furniture</b>.</li>
	<li><i>We found Alan weeping with</i> <b>relief</b> <i>and</i> <b>joy</b>.</li>
	<li><i>He saved</i> <b>money</b> <i>by refusing to have a telephone</i>.</li>
</ul>
