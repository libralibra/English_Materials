<p class="subTitle">2.304 with prepositional phrases</p>
<p>Some nouns, especially abstract nouns, need to be followed by a prepositional phrase to show what they relate to. There is often little or no choice about which preposition to use after a particular noun.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>I demanded access</i> <b>to a telephone</b>.</li>
	<li><i>...his authority</i> <b>over them</b>.</li>
	<li><i>...the solution</i> <b>to our energy problem</b>.</li>
	<li><i>...the bond</i> <b>between mother and child</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p class="clgm_hw">2.305</p>
<p>Here is a list of nouns which usually or often have 'to' after them:</p>
<ul>
	<li class="c_list"><b>access, addiction, adherence, affront, allegiance, allergy, allusion, alternative, answer, antidote, approach, attachment, aversion, contribution, damage, devotion, disloyalty, exception, fidelity, immune, incitement, introduction, preface, prelude, recourse, reference, relevance, reply, resistance, return, sequel, solution, susceptibility, testimony, threat, vulnerability, witness</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Here is a list of nouns which usually or often have 'for' after them:</p>
<ul>
	<li class="c_list"><b>admiration, appetite, aptitude, bid, craving, credit, cure, demand, desire, disdain, dislike, disregard, disrespect, hunger, love, need, provision, quest, recipe, regard, remedy, respect, responsibility, room, substitute, sympathy, synonym, taste, thirst</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Here is a list of nouns which usually or often have 'on' after them:</p>
<ul>
	<li class="c_list"><b>assault, attack, ban, claim, comment, concentration, constraint, crackdown, curb, dependence, effect, embargo, hold, insistence, reflection, reliance, restriction, stance, tax</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Here is a list of nouns which usually or often have 'with' after them:</p>
<ul>
	<li class="c_list"><b>affinity, collision, collusion, connection, contrast, correspondence, date, dealings, dissatisfaction, encounter, familiarity, identification, intersection, intimacy, involvement, link, parity, quarrel, relationship, sympathy</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Here is a list of nouns which are usually followed by one of two prepositions. The list indicates the choice of prepositions available:</p>
<ul>
	<li class="c_list"><b>agreement about, agreement on, argument against, argument for, battle against, battle for, case against, case for, debate about, debate on, decision about, decision on, transition from, transition to</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Many other nouns are usually followed by a preposition. The following list indicates which preposition follows each noun.</p>
<ul>
	<li class="c_list"><b>complex about,  --- , crime against, grudge against, insurance against, reaction against, safeguard against,  --- , departure from, escape from, excerpt from, freedom from, quotation from,  --- , foray into, relapse into,  --- , authority over, control over</b></li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see from the lists and examples given above, it is often the case that words with a similar meaning are typically followed by the same preposition. For example, 'appetite', 'craving', 'desire', 'hunger', and 'thirst' are all followed by 'for'.</p>
