<p class="subTitle">3.9 Talking about events which involve only the subject: intransitive verbs</p>
<p>When you are talking about an action or event which does not involve anyone or anything other than the subject, you use an <b>intransitive verb</b>.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>Her whole body</i> <b>ached</b>.</li>
	<li><i>Such people still</i> <b>exist</b>.</li>
	<li><i>My condition</i> <b>deteriorated</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Many intransitive verbs describe physical behaviour or the making of sounds.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>Bob</i> <b>coughed</b>.</li>
	<li><i>Vicki</i> <b>wept</b> <i>bitterly</i>.</li>
	<li><i>The gate</i> <b>squeaked</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p class="clgm_hw">3.10</p>
<p>Here is a list of verbs which are normally used in intransitive clauses and which usually or often have no adjunct after them:</p>
<ul>
	<li class="c_list"><b>ache, advance, arise, arrive, bleed, blush, cease, collapse, cough, crackle, cry, decay, depart, deteriorate, die, digress, dine, disappear, disintegrate, doze, droop, economize, elapse, ensue, erupt, evaporate, exist, expire, faint, fall, falter, fidget, flinch, flourish, fluctuate, gleam, growl, happen, hesitate, howl, itch, kneel, laugh, moan, occur, pause, persist, prosper, quiver, recede, relent, rise, roar, scream, shine, shiver, sigh, sleep, slip, smile, snarl, sneeze, snore, snort, sob, sparkle, speak, squeak, squeal, stink, subside, sulk, surrender, swim, throb, tingle, vanish, vary, vibrate, wait, waver, weep, wilt, work, yawn</b></li>
</ul>
<p>A few of these verbs are used transitively in idioms or with very specific objects, but they are intransitive in all their common meanings.</p>
