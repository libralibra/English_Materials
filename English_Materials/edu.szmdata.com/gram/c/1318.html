<p class="subTitle">10.46 saying that something exists</p>
<p>When you want to say that something exists, or when you want to mention the presence of something, you can use 'there' followed by 'be' and a noun group.</p>
<p>This structure is used in English because finite verbs must have a subject. But something new cannot be talked about until it has been introduced. So 'there' is used as the subject of the sentence and the new information is introduced after 'be'.</p>
<p>This use is different from the <b>adverb of place</b> 'there' and does not refer to a place. In spoken English, the difference is often clearer, because this use of 'there' is often pronounced without stress as |P|/!d%e/ whereas the adverb of place is almost always pronounced fully as |P|/!d!e%e/.</p>
<p>'There' has very little meaning in the structures that are being explained here. For example, the sentence 'There is a good reason for this' just means 'A good reason for this exists'.</p>
<p class="clgm_hw">10.47</p>
<p>The noun group is usually followed by an <b>adjunct</b>, a 'wh'-clause, or one of the adjectives 'available', 'present', or 'free'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>There were thirty boys in the class</i>.</li>
	<li><i>There are three reasons why we should support this action</i>.</li>
	<li><i>There were no other jobs available</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Adjuncts of place</b> can be put either in front of 'there' or after the noun group.</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>On a marble-topped table</b> <i>there was a big white china mug</i>.</li>
	<li><i>There was a long field</i> <b>on one side of the filling station</b>.</li>
</ul>
