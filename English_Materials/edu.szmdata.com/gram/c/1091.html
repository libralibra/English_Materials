<p class="subTitle">7.89 nominal use of 'that'-clauses</p>
<p>'That'-clauses can be used as complements after 'be' to refer to a fact or idea. The subject is usually one of the nouns listed in paragraph <b>7.84</b>.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>The fact is</i> <b>that a happy person makes a better worker</b>.</li>
	<li><i>The answer is simply</i> <b>that they are interested in doing it</b>.</li>
	<li><i>The most favoured explanation was</i> <b>that he was finally getting tired</b>.</li>
	<li><i>Our hope is</i> <b>that this time all parties will cooperate</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p class="clgm_hw">7.90</p>
<p>In formal English, 'that'-clauses are sometimes used as the subject of a verb, when people want to comment on a fact.</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>That I write with a bias</b> <i>is natural</i>.</li>
	<li><b>That man can aspire to and achieve goodness</b> <i>is evident through all of history</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>In less formal English, 'the fact' plus a 'that'-clause is often used as a subject instead of a simple 'that'-clause.</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>The fact that what they are doing is illegal</b> <i>is a trivial irrelevance</i>.</li>
	<li><b>The fact that your boss is actually offering to do your job for you</b> <i>should certainly prompt you to question his motives</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The normal way of commenting on a fact is to use an impersonal 'it' structure. See paragraph <b>7.88</b>.</p>
<p class="clgm_hw">7.91</p>
<p>People also use 'the fact' plus a 'that'-clause as the object of prepositions and of verbs which cannot be followed by a simple 'that'-clause.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>...acknowledgement of</i> <b>the fact that we have no intrinsic right to receive answers to all our questions</b>.</li>
	<li><i>We overlooked</i> <b>the fact that the children's emotional development had been retarded</b>.</li>
</ul>
