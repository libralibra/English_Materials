<p class="subTitle">8.15 events in sequence</p>
<p>You can also use 'when', 'after', or 'once' to talk about one event happening immediately after another.</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>When</b> <i>old Thrussel died, his widow came to me and said that he wished to be buried in the churchyard</i>.</li>
	<li><i>Stop me</i> <b>when</b> <i>you've had enough</i>.</li>
	<li><i>The turtle returns to the sea</i> <b>after</b> <i>it has laid its eggs</i>.</li>
	<li><b>Once</b> <i>environmental damage is done, it takes many years for the system to recover</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to say how long one event happened after another, you put a noun group such as 'two days' or 'three years' in front of 'after'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Exactly six weeks after</b> <i>she had arrived, she sent a cable to her husband and caught the plane back to New York</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>'As soon as', 'directly', 'immediately', 'the moment', 'the minute', and 'the instant' are all used to talk about one event happening a very short time after another.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>They heard voices</i> <b>as soon as</b> <i>they pushed open the door</i>.</li>
	<li><b>The moment</b> <i>Stagg had finished, he and the other two scientists were subjected to a barrage of questions</i>.</li>
	<li><b>Immediately</b> <i>the meal was over, it was time for prayer</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p class="clgm_hw">8.16</p>
<p>When you want to say that something happened, happens, or will happen at an earlier time than something else, you use 'before'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>It was necessary for them to find a roof to live under</i> <b>before</b> <i>the cold weather set in</i>.</li>
	<li><i>They had not even bothered to bury their comrades</i> <b>before</b> <i>they fled</i>.</li>
	<li><b>Before</b> <i>man exterminated the rabbits they were the staple food both of the foxes and the wildcats</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to say how long one event happened before another, you put a noun group such as 'three weeks' or 'a short time' in front of 'before'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>He had a review with the second organiser</i>, <b>about a month before</b> <i>the report was written</i>.</li>
	<li><b>Long before</b> <i>you return she will have forgotten you</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p class="clgm_hw">8.17</p>
<p>When you are telling a story, you sometimes want to say what was happening when a particular event occurred. You first say what was happening, then add a clause beginning with 'when' in which you mention the event.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>I had just started back for the house to change my clothes</i> <b>when</b> <i>I heard voices</i>.</li>
	<li><i>He was having his Christmas dinner</i> <b>when</b> <i>the telephone rang</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to say that one event happened a very short time after another, you use a clause in the past perfect tense, followed by a time clause in the simple past tense. After 'had' in the first clause, you put 'no sooner' or 'hardly'.</p>
<p>When you use 'no sooner', the time clause begins with 'than'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>I had</i> <b>no sooner</b> <i>checked into the hotel</i> <b>than</b> <i>he arrived with the appropriate documents</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>When you use 'hardly', the time clause begins with 'when' or 'before'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>He had</i> <b>hardly</b> <i>got his eyes open</i> <b>before</b> <i>she told him that they were leaving</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>'No sooner' or 'hardly' is often put at the beginning of the first clause, followed by 'had' and the subject.</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>No sooner</b> <i>had he asked the question</i> <b>than</b> <i>the answer came to him</i>.</li>
	<li><b>Hardly</b> <i>had the din faded behind them</i> <b>when</b> <i>they came upon another shouting crowd</i>.</li>
	<li><b>Hardly</b> <i>had Lamin wolfed down his meal</i> <b>before</b> <i>he flopped back onto the soft moss</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p class="clgm_hw">8.18</p>
<p>When something is the case because of a new situation, you can say what is the case and then add a subordinate clause saying what the new situation is. The subordinate clause begins with 'now' or 'now that'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>I feel better</i> <b>now</b> <i>I've talked to you</i>.</li>
	<li><i>He soon discovered how much faster he could travel</i> <b>now that</b> <i>he was alone</i>.</li>
</ul>
