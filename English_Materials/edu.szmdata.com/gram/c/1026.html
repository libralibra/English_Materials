<p class="subTitle">6.127 Extended meanings of prepositions</p>
<p>The uses of prepositional phrases as adjuncts of time and manner are really extended or metaphorical uses that cover a wide range of prepositions and are part of a metaphor that affects many other aspects of language as well. For example, when we talk about 'approaching a point in time', 'a short stretch of time', and so on, we are using words that refer to space to talk about time.</p>
<p>However, there are also extended meanings that apply only to small groups of prepositions, or sometimes only to individual prepositions.</p>
<p>For example, 'in' basically indicates position inside a container:</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>The baby was found</i> <b>in a carrier bag</b>.</li>
	<li><i>It will end up</i> <b>in the dustbin</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>But it is often used with reference to areas rather than containers.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>Emma sat</i> <b>in an armchair</b> <i>with her legs crossed</i>.</li>
	<li><i>Then we were told what had happened</i> <b>in Sheffield</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>'In' is also used to indicate relative position:</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>We had to do something</i> <b>in the centre</b> <i>of the town to attract visitors</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, 'in' is used in ways that extend its meaning further away from physical position. For example, it can be used to say that someone is a involved in a particular situation, group, or activity.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>They were</i> <b>in no danger</b>.</li>
	<li><i>The child was</i> <b>in trouble</b> <i>with the police</i>.</li>
	<li><i>I remember when the Colonels were</i> <b>in power</b> <i>in Greece</i>.</li>
	<li><i>Mr Emile Gumbs has remained</i> <b>in office</b> <i>but the island has no Parliament</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>It can indicate inclusion in a more abstract way.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>Some of her early Hollywood experiences were used</i> <b>in her 1923 film</b>, <i>Mary of the Movies</i>.</li>
	<li><b>In any book</b>, <i>you have a moral purpose</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>It can also indicate that something has reached a particular stage, or appears in a particular way:</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>The first primroses are</i> <b>in flower</b>.</li>
	<li><i>Her hair was</i> <b>in pigtails</b> <i>over either shoulder</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>A few other prepositions with a basic meaning relating to containers can be used in similar ways: for example 'within', 'into', 'out of'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>The US ought to do everything</i> <b>within reason</b> <i>to encourage General Noriega to leave</i>.</li>
	<li><i>Those men, when we get them</i> <b>into the police force</b>, <i>are going to be real heroes</i>.</li>
</ul>
