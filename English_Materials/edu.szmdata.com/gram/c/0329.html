<p class="subTitle">2.194 Talking about amounts of things: quantifiers</p>
<p>When you want to refer to a quantity of things or to an amount of something in everyday language, you use a <b>quantifier</b>.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>I am sure</i> <b>both of</b> <i>you agree with me</i>.</li>
	<li><i>...a house with</i> <b>lots of</b> <i>windows</i>.</li>
	<li><b>Most of</b> <i>the population have fled</i>.</li>
	<li><i>I make</i> <b>a lot of</b> <i>mistakes</i>.</li>
	<li><i>In Tunis there are</i> <b>a number of</b> <i>art galleries</i>.</li>
	<li><i>I never found</i> <b>the rest of</b> <i>my relatives</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that all quantifiers consist of two or more words, because 'of' is needed in every case, and is printed in the lists below as a reminder.</p>

<p>Here is the list of quantifiers:</p>
<ul>
	<li class="c_list"><b>all of, another of, any of, both of, certain of, each of, either of, enough of, few of, fewer of, less of, little of, lots of, many of, more of, most of, much of, neither of, none of, numbers of, one of, part of, plenty of, quantities of, several of, some of, various of, 5*T, an amount of, a bit of, a little bit of, a couple of, a good deal of, a great deal of, a few of, a little of, a lot of, a good many of, a great many of, a number of, a quantity of,  --- , a majority of, the majority of, a minority of,  --- , the remainder of, the rest of, the whole of,  --- , heaps of, loads of, masses of, tons of</b></li>
