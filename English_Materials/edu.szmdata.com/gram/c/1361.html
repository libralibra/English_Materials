<p class="subTitle">10.92 Putting something first: fronting</p>
<p>In English, the first element in a declarative clause is usually the subject of the verb. However, if you want to emphasize another element, you can put that first instead.</p>
<p>Putting a word at the front of a clause for emphasis is called <b>fronting</b>. Sometimes when fronting takes place the normal order of subject and verb is changed. This is called <b>inversion</b>.</p>
