<p class="subTitle">5.81 likely change</p>
<p>If you want to say that a situation which has existed up to the present time may change in the future, you can use 'as yet', 'so far', 'up to now', or 'up till now'. They are normally placed either at the beginning or the end of the clause. They are also occasionally placed after an auxiliary verb.</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>As yet</b>, <i>there is little to suggest that the Prince is an exception in this</i>.</li>
	<li><i>Only Mother knows</i> <b>as yet</b>.</li>
	<li><b>So far</b>, <i>the terms of the treaty have been carried out according to schedule</i>.</li>
	<li><i>You've done well</i> <b>so far</b>, <i>Mrs Rutland</i>.</li>
	<li><b>Up till now</b>, <i>the most extraordinary remark I remember was made by you</i>.</li>
	<li><i>This troop had</i> <b>up to now</b> <i>succeeded in preventing the movement of any but light forces across the River Lippe</i>.</li>
	<li><i>You haven't once</i> <b>up till now</b> <i>come into real contact with our authorities</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that these expressions can be used in affirmative and negative statements.</p>
