<p class="subTitle">5.135 Indicating the whole of a period</p>
<p>If you want to emphasize that something lasts for the whole of a period of time, you can use 'all' as a determiner with many general time words.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>'I've been wanting to do this</i> <b>all day,'</b> <i>she said</i>.</li>
	<li><i>I've been here</i> <b>all night</b>.</li>
	<li><i>They said you were out</i> <b>all afternoon</b>.</li>
	<li><i>We've not seen them</i> <b>all summer</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also use 'whole' as a modifier in front of a general time word.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>They forecast a fall in profits for</i> <b>the whole of 1989</b>.</li>
	<li><i>...scientists who are monitoring food safety</i> <b>the whole time</b>.</li>
	<li><i>...women who have stopped menstruating for</i> <b>a whole year</b></li>
</ul>
<p>You can also use 'all through', 'right through', and 'throughout' with 'the' and many general time words, or with a specific decade, year, month, or special period.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>Discussions and arguments continued</i> <b>all through the day</b>.</li>
	<li><b>Right through the summer months</b> <i>they are rarely out of sight</i>.</li>
	<li><b>Throughout the Sixties</b>, <i>man's first voyage to other worlds came closer</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Words referring to events can be used instead of the time words, to emphasize that something happened for the entire duration of the event.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>He wore an expression of angry contempt</i> <b>throughout the interrogation</b>.</li>
	<li><i>A patient reported a dream that had recurred</i> <b>throughout her life</b>.</li>
	<li><b>All through the cruelly long journey home</b>, <i>he lay utterly motionless</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p class="clgm_hw">5.136</p>
<p>If you want to emphasize that something happens all the time, you can list periods of the day or seasons of the year, or mention contrasting ones.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>...people coming in</i> <b>morning, noon, and night</b>.</li>
	<li><i>I've worn the same suit</i> <b>summer, winter, autumn and spring</b>, <i>for five years</i>.</li>
	<li><i>Thousands of slave labourers worked</i> <b>night and day</b> <i>to build the fortifications</i>.</li>
	<li><i>Ten gardeners used to work this land</i>, <b>winter and summer</b>.</li>
</ul>
