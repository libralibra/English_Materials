<p class="subTitle">8.147 USAGE NOTE</p>
<p>When you are giving advice, you sometimes want to tell someone what will happen if they do a particular thing. You do this by using an imperative clause, followed by 'and' and a clause containing a verb in a future tense.</p>
<p>For example, instead of saying 'If you go by train, you'll get there quicker', you can say 'Go by train and you'll get there quicker'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>Do as you are told</i> <b>and</b> <i>you'll be alright</i>.</li>
	<li><i>You put me out here</i> <b>and</b> <i>you'll lose your job tomorrow</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>When you are giving advice, a warning, or an order, you sometimes want to tell someone what will happen if they do not do what you say. You do this by using an imperative clause, followed by 'or' and a clause containing a verb in a future tense.</p>
<p>For example, instead of saying 'Go away! If you don't go away, I'll scream', you can say 'Go away, or I'll scream'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>Hurry up</i>, <b>or</b> <i>you'll be late for school</i>.</li>
	<li><i>So don't go prying into my affairs</i> <b>or</b> <i>you'll get hurt</i>.</li>
</ul>
