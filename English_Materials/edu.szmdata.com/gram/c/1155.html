<p class="subTitle">8.101 Using 'whose'</p>
<p>If you want to talk about something relating to the person, thing, or group you are talking about, you use a relative clause beginning with 'whose' and a noun group.</p>
<p>For example, instead of saying 'I am writing a letter to Nigel. His father is ill', you can say 'I am writing a letter to Nigel, whose father is ill'.</p>
<p>'Whose' can be used in defining or non-defining clauses.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>...workers</i> <b>whose bargaining power</b> <i>is weak</i>.</li>
	<li><i>...anyone</i> <b>whose credit card</b> <i>is stolen</i>.</li>
	<li><i>She asked friends</i> <b>whose opinion</b> <i>she respected</i>.</li>
	<li><i>...a country</i> <b>whose population</b> <i>was growing</i>.</li>
	<li><i>According to Cook</i>, <b>whose book</b> <i>is published on Thursday, most disasters are avoidable</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The noun after 'whose' can be the subject or object of the verb in the clause, or it can be the object of a preposition. If it is the object of a preposition, the preposition can come at the beginning or end of the clause.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>...the governments</i> <b>in whose territories</b> <i>they operate</i>.</li>
	<li><i>...some strange fragment of thought</i> <b>whose origin</b> <i>I have no idea</i> <b>of</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p class="clgm_hw">8.102</p>
<p>In written English, 'of which' and 'of whom' are sometimes used instead of 'whose'. You put these expressions after a noun group beginning with 'the'.</p>
<p>For example, instead of writing 'a town whose inhabitants speak French', you can write 'a town the inhabitants of which speak French'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>...circumstances</i> <b>the continuance of which</b> <i>was prejudicial to the safety of the public</i>.</li>
	<li><i>I travelled in a lorry</i> <b>the back of which</b> <i>the owner had loaded with yams</i>.</li>
</ul>
