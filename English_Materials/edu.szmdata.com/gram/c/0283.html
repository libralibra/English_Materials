<p class="subTitle">2.121 qualifying structures</p>
<p>You can use a superlative on its own if it is clear what is being compared. For example, if you say 'The sergeant was the tallest', you are referring to a group of soldiers which has already been identified.</p>
<p>If you need to refer to the point of the comparison, you use a qualifying phrase or clause which consists of</p>
<p>*  a prepositional phrase normally beginning with 'in' or 'of'</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>Henry was</i> <b>the biggest of them</b>.</li>
	<li><i>The third requirement is</i> <b>the most important of all</b>.</li>
	<li><i>These cakes are probably</i> <b>the best in the world</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that if the superlative is a modifier in front of a noun, the prepositional phrase comes after the noun.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i></i>...<b>the best</b> <i>bargain for his money</i>.</li>
	<li><i>I'm in</i> <b>the worst</b> <i>business in the world</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p> *  a relative clause</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>The best</b> <i>I'm likely to get</i>.</li>
	<li><i>The visiting room was</i> <b>the worst</b> <i>I had seen</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that if the superlative is a modifier in front of a noun, the relative clause comes after the noun.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i></i>... <b>the most dangerous</b> <i>man in the country</i>.</li>
	<li><i>He and Nell had</i> <b>the most expensive</b> <i>dinner of their lives</i>.</li>
	<li><i>That's</i> <b>the most convincing</b> <i>answer that you've given me</i>.</li>
</ul>
