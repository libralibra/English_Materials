<p class="subTitle">6.24 same form as adjective</p>
<p>In some cases, an adverb has the same form as an adjective and is similar in meaning. For example, 'fast' is an adverb in the sentence 'News travels fast' and an adjective in the sentence 'She likes fast cars'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>...British Rail's plans for a</i> <b>fast</b> <i>rail link from London to the Channel Tunnel</i>.</li>
	<li><i>The driver was driving too</i> <b>fast</b> <i>for the conditions</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>In these cases, the adverb is usually placed immediately after the verb or object, and rarely in front of the verb.</p>
<ul>
	<li class="c_list"><b>alike, downtown, extra, far, fast, inside, long, next, outside, overseas, past, straight, through</b></li>
</ul>
<p>There are also a number of words ending in '-ly' which are both adverbs and adjectives, for example 'daily', 'monthly', and 'yearly'. These relate to frequency and are explained in paragraph <b>5.120</b>.</p>
<p class="clgm_hw">6.25</p>
<p>Several postdeterminers, including 'further', 'next', 'only', 'opposite', and 'same', have the same form as adverbs but no direct relation in meaning. Note that 'well' is an adverb and adjective, but usually means 'not ill' as an adjective, and 'with skill or success' as an adverb.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>He has done</i> <b>well</b>.</li>
</ul>
