<p>When you want to refer to a size, distance, area, volume, weight, speed, or temperature, you can do so by using a number or quantifier in front of a <b>measurement noun</b> such as 'feet' and 'miles'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>He was about six</i> <b>feet</b> <i>tall</i>.</li>
	<li><i>I walked ten</i> <b>miles</b>, <i>there and back, to Woodbridge every day</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Measurement nouns are explained in paragraphs <b>2.267 to 2.274</b>.</p>
<p>If you do not know the exact number, size, or quantity of something, you can give an approximate amount or measurement using one of a group of special words and expressions. These are explained in paragraphs <b>2.281 to 2.288</b>.</p>
