<p class="subTitle">2.181 possessive form</p>
<p>You usually show that something belongs to or is associated with someone by adding ''s' to the name of the person, and by placing this possessive form in front of the thing that belongs to them, or is associated with them. For example, if John owns a motorbike, you can refer to it as 'John's motorbike'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>Sylvia put her hand on</i> <b>John's</b> <i>arm</i>.</li>
	<li><i>It was probably</i> <b>Mrs Thatcher's</b> <i>greatest error</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>When you use a noun rather than a name to refer to the person, the noun group containing the possessive form also contains a determiner in the usual way.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i></i>...<b>his grandmother's</b> <i>house</i>.</li>
	<li><b>Your mother's</b> <i>best handbag</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that the determiner applies to the possessive form and not to the noun which is being modified by the possessive.</p>
