<p class="subTitle">6.12 minor positional points</p>
<p>If a clause has two adjuncts, and one is an adverb and the other is a prepositional phrase, you can usually place either of them first.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>Miss Burns looked</i> <b>calmly</b> <b>at Marianne</b>.</li>
	<li><i>They were sitting</i> <b>happily</b> <b>in the car</b>.</li>
	<li><i>The women shouted</i> <b>at me</b> <b>savagely</b>.</li>
	<li><i>He got</i> <b>into the car</b> <b>quickly</b> <i>and drove off</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, if the prepositional phrase is rather long, it is more common to place the adverb first, immediately after the verb.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>He listened</i> <b>calmly</b> <i>to the report of his aides</i>.</li>
	<li><i>She would sit</i> <b>crosslegged</b> <i>in her red robes</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Similarly, if the verb group is followed by a long object, the adverb comes after the verb and before the object.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>He could picture</i> <b>easily</b> <i>the consequences of being found by the owners</i>.</li>
	<li><i>She sang</i> <b>beautifully</b> <i>a school song the children had taught her when they were little</i>.</li>
</ul>
