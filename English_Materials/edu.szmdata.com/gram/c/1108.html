<p class="subTitle">8.25 Conditional clauses</p>
<p>When you want to talk about a possible situation and its consequences, you use a <b>conditional clause</b>.</p>
<p>Conditional clauses are used:</p>
<p>*  to talk about a situation which sometimes exists or existed</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>If they lose weight during an illness</b>, <i>they soon regain it afterwards</i>.</li>
	<li><i>Government cannot operate effectively</i> <b>unless it is free from such interference</b>.</li>
	<li><b>If I saw him in the street</b>, <i>he'd just say 'Good morning.'</i></li>
</ul>
<p> *  to talk about a situation which you know does not exist</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>If England had a hot climate</b>, <i>the attitude would be different</i>.</li>
	<li><b>If I could afford it</b> <i>I would buy a boat</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p> *  to talk about a situation when you do not know whether it exists or not</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>If he is right</b> <i>it would be possible once more to manage the economy in the old way</i>.</li>
	<li><i>There's no reason why she should have come here</i> <b>unless it was to cadge free drinks</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p> *  to talk about a situation which may exist in the future.</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>If I marry Celia</b> <i>we shall need the money to live on</i>.</li>
	<li><b>If I went back on the train</b> <i>it'd be cheaper</i>.</li>
	<li><i>Don't bring her</i> <b>unless she's sober</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sentences containing conditional clauses are sometimes called <b>conditional sentences</b>.</p>
<p class="clgm_hw">8.26</p>
<p>Conditional clauses usually begin with 'if' or 'unless'.</p>
<p>You use 'if' to say that a consequence of something happening or being the case would be that something else would happen or be the case.</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>If</b> <i>you do that I shall be very pleased</i>.</li>
	<li><b>If</b> <i>I asked for something I got it</i>.</li>
	<li><i>They will even clean your car</i> <b>if</b> <i>they're in the mood</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>When an 'if'-clause is put first, 'then' is sometimes put at the beginning of the main clause.</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>If</b> <i>this is what was happening in the Sixties</i>, <b>then</b> <i>I'm glad I wasn't around then</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>'Unless' means 'if...not'. For example, 'You will fail your exams unless you work harder' means 'If you do not work harder, you will fail your exams'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>There can be no new growth</i> <b>unless</b> <i>the ground is cleared</i>.</li>
	<li><i>Nobody gets anything</i> <b>unless</b> <i>they ask for it</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Clauses beginning with 'unless' usually go after a main clause.</p>
