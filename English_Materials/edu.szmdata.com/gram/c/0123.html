<p class="subTitle">1.138 structures used with 'some-' and 'every-'</p>
<p>Like all noun groups, indefinite pronouns are used as the subject, object, or indirect object of clauses. They can also be used as the objects of prepositions. The indefinite pronouns beginning with 'some-' and 'every-' are most often used in affirmative clauses.</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Everything</b> <i>went according to plan</i>.</li>
	<li><i>I remember</i> <b>somebody</b> <i>putting a pillow under my head</i>.</li>
	<li><i>'Now you'll see</i> <b>something'</b>, <i>he said</i>.</li>
	<li><i>I gave</i> <b>everyone</b> <i>a generous helping</i>.</li>
	<li><i>I want to introduce you to</i> <b>someone</b> <i>who is helping me</i>.</li>
	<li><i>'Have you seen Frank? Is</i> <b>everything</b> <i>all right?'</i></li>
</ul>
<p>They are sometimes used as the subject of a negative clause.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>He could tell that</i> <b>something</b> <i>wasn't right</i>.</li>
	<li><b>Everyone</b> <i>hadn't arrived yet</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that the indefinite pronouns beginning with 'some-' cannot be used as the object of a negative clause, unless they are followed by a qualifier, usually a prepositional phrase or a relative clause.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>He wasn't</i> <b>someone</b> <i>I admired as a writer</i>.</li>
	<li><i>I wouldn't forget</i> <b>something</b> <i>that I finished reading only half an hour ago</i>.</li>
</ul>
