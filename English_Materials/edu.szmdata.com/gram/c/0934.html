<p class="subTitle">6.8 beginning of clause for emphasis</p>
<p>You can emphasize the adjunct by placing it at the beginning of the clause, in front of the subject.</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Gently</b> <i>Fanny leaned forward and wiped the old lady's tears away</i>.</li>
	<li><b>In his excitement</b> <i>Billy had forgotten the letter</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The adjunct is often separated by a comma from the rest of the clause.</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>After much discussion</b>, <i>they had decided to take the coin to the jeweller</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>This position is often used in written stories to draw attention to the adjunct. For more information, see paragraph <b>10.93</b>.</p>
<p>Note that adverbs of degree are rarely used at the beginning of a clause: see paragraph <b>6.45</b>.</p>
