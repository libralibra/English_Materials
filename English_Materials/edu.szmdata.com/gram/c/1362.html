<p class="subTitle">10.93 adjuncts</p>
<p><b>Adjuncts</b> can often be put first. This is the normal position for sentence adjuncts (see paragraph 10.56), so they are not particularly emphatic in this position. Other adjuncts are sometimes placed first, usually for extra vividness in stories and accounts.</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>At eight o'clock</b> <i>I went down for my breakfast</i>.</li>
	<li><b>For years</b> <i>I'd had to hide what I was thinking</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Inversion often occurs after adjuncts of place and negative adjuncts.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>She rang the bell for Sylvia. In</i> <b>came a girl she had not seen before</b>.</li>
	<li><i>On no account</i> <b>must they be let in</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Inversion does not occur when the subject is a pronoun.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>With a sigh</i>, <b>he</b> <i>rose and walked away</i>.</li>
</ul>
