<p class="subTitle">7.59 referring to time</p>
<p>When reporting, you may need to change <b>adjuncts of time</b> such as 'today', 'yesterday', or 'next week'.</p>
<p>For example, if someone called Jill says 'I will come tomorrow', you could report this statement the following day as 'Jill said she would come today'. At a later time, you could report the same statement as 'Jill said she would come the next day' or 'Jill said she would come the following day'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>We decided to leave the city</i> <b>the next day</b>.</li>
	<li><i>I was afraid people might think I'd been asleep during</i> <b>the previous twenty-four hours</b>.</li>
</ul>
