<p class="subTitle">6.102 adverbs as qualifiers</p>
<p>Like prepositional phrases, adverbs can also be used as qualifiers after nouns rather than as adjuncts after verbs.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>...the man who watched him from the terrace</i> <b>above</b>.</li>
	<li><i>...the two women who ran the restaurant</i> <b>next door</b>.</li>
	<li><i>The man</i> <b>opposite</b> <i>rises, and lifts down her case</i>.</li>
	<li><i>People</i> <b>everywhere</b> <i>are becoming more conscious of inequality</i>.</li>
	<li><i>...the road</i> <b>south</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p class="clgm_hw">6.103</p>
<p>Instead of using a noun group to refer to a place, you can use the name of the place.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>This great block of land became</i> <b>Antarctica</b>.</li>
	<li><i>...a Baltic island roughly the size of the</i> <b>Isle of Man</b>.</li>
	<li><i>Outstanding examples of her work are included in an exhibition at the</i> <b>National Museum of Film and Photography</b> <i>in</i> <b>Bradford</b>.</li>
</ul>
