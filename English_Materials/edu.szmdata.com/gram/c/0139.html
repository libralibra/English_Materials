<p class="subTitle">1.157 other pronouns</p>
<p>The number 'one' is a special case. Like other cardinal numbers, it can be used to refer to one of a group of things.</p>
<p>'One' is also used to refer back to a noun group with the determiner 'a'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>Could I have a bigger</i> <b>one</b>, <i>please?</i></li>
</ul>
<p>It can also be used for emphasis after another determiner.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>There are systems of communication right through the animal world</i>; <b>each one</b> <i>is distinctive</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>'One' can be used as a <b>personal pronoun</b>. This use is explained in paragraph <b>1.109</b>.</p>
<p class="clgm_hw">1.158</p>
<p>Note that 'the one' and 'the ones' can be used to refer to a noun alone, rather than to the whole of the noun group. They are nearly always used with a modifier such as an adjective, or a qualifier such as a prepositional phrase.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>'Which poem?'</i> <b>'The one</b> <i>they were talking about yesterday.'</i></li>
	<li><i>...the road comes up from the south and meets</i> <b>the one</b> <i>from Lairg</i>.</li>
	<li><i>He gave the best seats to</i> <b>the ones</b> <i>who arrived first</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p class="clgm_hw">1.159</p>
<p>You use 'the other', 'the others', 'others', or 'another' to refer to different members of a group of things or people.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>Some writers are greater than</i> <b>others</b>.</li>
	<li><i>He is deceived</i>. <b>The others</b> <i>cannot bear his burden for him</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p class="clgm_hw">1.160</p>
<p>If you want to say something about a member of a group of people or things you can use 'one'. You can then refer to the rest of the group as 'the others'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>The bells are carefully installed so that disconnecting</i> <b>one</b> <i>will have no effect on</i> <b>the others</b>.</li>
	<li><i>They had three little daughters</i>, <b>one</b> <i>a baby</i>, <b>the others</b> <i>twins of twelve</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can use 'the one' and 'the other' to refer to each of a pair of things.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>The same factors push wages and prices up together</i>, <b>the one</b> <i>reinforcing</i> <b>the other</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you do not wish to specify exactly which of a group you are talking about, you can refer to 'one or other' of them.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>It may be that</i> <b>one or other</b> <i>of them had fears for their health</i>.</li>
</ul>
