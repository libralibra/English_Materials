<p class="subTitle">8.78 Clauses of manner</p>
<p>When you want to talk about someone's behaviour or the way something is done, you use a <b>clause of manner</b>.</p>
<p>Here is a list of conjunctions used in clauses of manner:</p>
<ul>
	<li class="c_list"><b>as, as if, as though, just as, like, much as</b></li>
</ul>
<p>'The way', 'in a way', and 'in the way' are also used in clauses of manner in a similar way to conjunctions. These expressions are often followed by 'that'.</p>
