<p class="subTitle">1.196 WARNING</p>
<p>In English, you do not use more than one specific determiner before a noun. Therefore, possessive determiners must be used on their own. You cannot say 'I took off the my shoes'. You have to choose whether to say 'I took off my shoes', or 'I took off the shoes'.</p>
