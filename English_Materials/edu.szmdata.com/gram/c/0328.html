<p class="subTitle">2.193 Talking about quantities and amounts</p>
<p>This section deals with ways of referring to quantities and amounts of things. You often refer to quantities by using a number, but sometimes in everyday situations you can do this by using a word or a phrase such as 'several' and 'a bottle' and link it with 'of' to the following noun group in a <b>partitive structure</b>. When words like 'several' are used like this, they are called <b>quantifiers</b>. Quantifiers are explained in paragraphs <b>2.194 to 2.210</b>. When phrases such as 'a bottle' are used like this, they are called <b>partitives</b>. Partitives are explained in paragraphs <b>2.211 to 2.224</b>.</p>
<p>When you want to be very precise about the quantity or amount of something, you can <b>numbers</b> (see paragraphs <b>2.225 to 2.256</b>) or <b>fractions</b> (see paragraphs <b>2.257 to 2.266</b>).</p>
<p>Numbers, fractions, and quantifiers are also used in expressions of measurement to indicate the size, weight, length, and so on, of something. Ways of talking about measurements are explained in paragraphs <b>2.267 to 2.274</b>. Approximate measurements are explained in paragraphs <b>2.281 to 2.288</b>. Numbers are also used to say how old someone or something is. This is explained in paragraphs <b>2.275 to 2.280</b>.</p>
