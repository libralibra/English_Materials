<p class="subTitle">1.51 WARNING</p>
<p>Although you can use a plural verb after a collective noun, these nouns do not behave like the plural forms of count nouns.</p>
<p>For example, you cannot use numbers in front of them. You cannot say 'Three enemy were killed'. You have to say 'Three of the enemy were killed'.</p>
