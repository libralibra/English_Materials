<p class="subTitle">6.18 spelling</p>
<p>Some '-ly' adverbs have slightly different spellings from the adjectives they are related to, for example 'nastily', 'gently', 'terribly', 'academically', 'truly', and 'fully'.</p>
<p class="clgm_hw">6.19</p>
<p>Not all adverbs ending in '-ly' are adverbs of manner. Some are adverbs of degree, such as 'extremely' and 'slightly': see the list at paragraph <b>6.45</b>.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>I enjoyed the course</i> <b>immensely</b>.</li>
	<li><i>Mansell narrowed the gap</i> <b>slightly</b>, <i>but soon Prost was edging away again</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>A few are adverbs of time, duration, or frequency, such as 'briefly', 'presently', and 'weekly'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>At 10.15 a.m. soldiers</i> <b>briefly</b> <i>opened fire again</i>.</li>
	<li><i>Mr Kinnock can</i> <b>presently</b> <i>be seen experiencing the same sort of trouble</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Others are adverbs of place, such as 'locally' and 'internationally', linking adverbs such as 'consequently', or sentence adverbs such as 'actually'. For lists of adverbs of place, see the section beginning at paragraph <b>6.82</b>.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>The lady replied: 'Well, you live</i> <b>locally</b> <i>and have never caused any bother.'</i></li>
	<li><i>These efforts have received little credit</i> <b>internationally</b>.</li>
	<li><i>They did not preach</i>. <b>Consequently</b>, <i>they reached a vastly wider audience</i>.</li>
	<li><i>There still remains something to say. Several things</i>, <b>actually</b>.</li>
</ul>
