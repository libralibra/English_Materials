<p class="subTitle">9.1 Making texts: cohesion</p>
<p>When you speak or write, you very often want to make some connection with other things that you are saying or writing. There are several ways of doing this and they provide <b>cohesion</b> in your use of language.</p>
<p>The most common way of providing cohesion is by referring back to something that has already been mentioned. The different ways of referring back are explained in paragraphs <b>9.2 to 9.40</b>.</p>
<p>There are also a few ways of referring forward to what you are about to say. These are explained in paragraphs <b>9.41 to 9.48</b>.</p>
<p>People often avoid repeating words when they are referring back. This is called <b>ellipsis</b>. Ellipsis is explained in paragraphs <b>9.49 to 9.69</b>.</p>
<p>Another way of providing cohesion is by using various cohesive words and phrases such as 'firstly' and 'in conclusion' that show the connection between things. These are explained in Chapter 10 (<b>10.73 to 10.81</b>), with other <b>sentence adjuncts</b>.</p>
