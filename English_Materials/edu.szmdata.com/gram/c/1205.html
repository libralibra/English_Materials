<p class="subTitle">8.166 linking pronouns</p>
<p>You can put 'and', 'or', or 'not' between a pronoun and a noun group, or between two pronouns.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>Howard</i> <b>and</b> <i>I are planning a party</i>.</li>
	<li><i>She</i> <b>and</b> <i>I have a very good relationship</i>.</li>
	<li><i>If you</i> <b>or</b> <i>your husband have paid enough contributions, you are entitled to a grant</i>.</li>
	<li><i>I felt that the new plant should bear his name, for he</i>, <b>not</b> <i>I, had done the work</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>When you say something about yourself and someone else, you usually put the pronoun or noun group referring to the other person first, and the pronoun referring to yourself second.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>My sister</i> <b>and</b> <i>I lived totally different kinds of lives</i>.</li>
	<li><i>You</i> <b>and</b> <i>I must have a talk together</i>.</li>
	<li><i>...a difference of opinion between John</i> <b>and</b> <i>me</i>.</li>
	<li><i>The first people to hear were the Foreign Secretary</i> <b>and</b> <i>myself</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p>For information on how to coordinate more than two noun groups, see paragraph <b>8.188</b>.</p>
