<p class="subTitle">4.2 Statements, questions, orders, and suggestions</p>
<p>Sentences can be used to do many different things.</p>
<p>The most common use is to give information.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>I went to Glasgow University</i>.</li>
	<li><i>Carol was one of my sister's best friends</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sometimes you use a sentence to obtain information, rather than to give it.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>Where is my father?</i></li>
	<li><i>What did you say to Myra?</i></li>
	<li><i>How long have you been out of this country?</i></li>
</ul>
<p>At other times you want to express an opinion, give an order, make a suggestion, or make a promise.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>That's an excellent idea</i>.</li>
	<li><i>Go away, all of you</i>.</li>
	<li><i>Shall we listen to the news?</i></li>
	<li><i>If you have any questions, I'll do my best to answer them</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>When someone says or writes a sentence, they need to indicate what they are trying to do with it, so that it will be clear, for example, that they are asking a question and not making a statement.</p>
