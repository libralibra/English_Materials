<p class="subTitle">7.26 Reporting statements and thoughts</p>
<p>If you want to report a statement or someone's thoughts, you use a reported clause beginning with the conjunction 'that'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>He said</i> <b>that the police had directed him to the wrong room</b>.</li>
	<li><i>He wrote me a letter saying</i> <b>that he understood what I was doing</b>.</li>
	<li><i>Mrs Kaul announced</i> <b>that the lecture would now begin</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>In informal speech and writing, the conjunction 'that' is commonly omitted.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>They said</i> <b>I had to see a doctor first</b>.</li>
	<li><i>She says</i> <b>she wants to see you this afternoon</b>.</li>
	<li><i>He knew</i> <b>the attempt was hopeless</b>.</li>
	<li><i>I think</i> <b>there's something wrong</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>In each of these sentences, 'that' could have been used. For example, you can say either 'They said I had to see a doctor first' or 'They said that I had to see a doctor first'.</p>
<p>'That' is often omitted when the reporting verb refers simply to the act of saying or thinking. You usually include 'that' after a verb which gives more information, such as 'complain' or 'explain'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>His brother</i> <b>complained that</b> <i>the office was not businesslike</i>.</li>
	<li><i>I</i> <b>explained that</b> <i>she would have to stay in bed</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>This kind of reported clause is often called a <b>'that'-clause</b>, even though many occur without 'that'.</p>
<p>Note that some relative clauses also begin with 'that'. In these clauses, 'that' is a relative pronoun, not a conjunction. Relative clauses are explained in paragraphs <b>8.83 to 8.116</b>.</p>
