<p class="subTitle">1.120 used for emphasis or contrast</p>
<p>Especially in speech, people sometimes use reflexive pronouns rather than personal pronouns as the object of a preposition, in order to emphasize them.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>My first pupil today is a Pole like</i> <b>myself</b>.</li>
	<li><i>...the following conversation between</i> <b>myself</b> <i>and a fifteen-year-old girl</i>.</li>
	<li><i>The circle spread to include</i> <b>himself</b> <i>and Ferdinand</i>.</li>
	<li><i>People like</i> <b>yourself</b> <i>still find new things to say about Shakespeare</i>.</li>
	<li><i>There is always someone worse off than</i> <b>yourself</b>.</li>
	<li><i>With the exception of a few Algerians and</i> <b>ourselves</b> <i>everyone spoke Spanish</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p class="clgm_hw">1.121</p>
<p>You can also reflexive pronouns in addition to nouns or personal pronouns. You usually do this in order to make it clear or to emphasize who or what you are referring to.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>We</i> <b>ourselves</b> <i>have got to build our own strength</i>.</li>
	<li><i>Sally</i> <b>herself</b> <i>came back</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also use a reflexive pronoun to compare or contrast one person or thing with another.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>His friend looked as miserable as he felt</i> <b>himself</b>.</li>
	<li><i>It is not Liverpool I miss, but England</i> <b>itself</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The reflexive pronoun can follow the noun or pronoun that it relates to.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>Sally</i> <b>herself</b> <i>came back</i>.</li>
	<li><i>It is hot in London; but I</i> <b>myself</b> <i>can work better when it's hot</i>.</li>
	<li><i>The town</i> <b>itself</b> <i>was so small that it didn't have a priest</i>.</li>
	<li><i>The lane ran right up to the wood</i> <b>itself</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>It can also be placed at the end of the clause.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>I am not a particularly punctual person</i> <b>myself</b>.</li>
	<li><i>You'll probably understand better when you are a grandparent</i> <b>yourself</b>.</li>
	<li><i>It is rare for Governments to take the initiative</i> <b>themselves</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p class="clgm_hw">1.122</p>
<p>You can use a reflexive pronoun to emphasize that someone did something without any help or interference from anyone else. In this use, the reflexive pronoun is normally placed at the end of the clause.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>She had printed the card</i> <b>herself</b>.</li>
	<li><i>I'll take it down to the police station</i> <b>myself</b>.</li>
	<li><i>Did you make these</i> <b>yourself?</b></li>
</ul>
