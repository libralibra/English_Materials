<p class="subTitle">10.101 using sentences as prefaces</p>
<p>A whole sentence can be used as a preface to the sentence or sentences that follow it. For example, a sentence containing an adjective like 'interesting', 'remarkable', or 'funny', or a general abstract word such as 'reason' or 'factor' (see paragraphs <b>9.19 to 9.23</b>), is often used as a preface.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>It was rather</i> <b>funny</b>. <i>There were two gentlemen that were standing --- one was terribly elegant --- and we were sitting there, a couple of interlopers</i>.</li>
	<li><i>This has had very</i> <b>interesting</b> <i>effects on different people</i>.</li>
	<li><i>There were other</i> <b>factors</b>, <i>of course: I too was tired of London</i>.</li>
	<li><i>But there were</i> <b>problems</b>. <i>How could the eggs be prevented from drying out and how could tadpoles develop out of water?</i></li>
</ul>
