<p class="subTitle">5.6 subordinate clauses</p>
<p>This chapter deals only with the choice of tense in <b>main clauses</b>.</p>
<p>Sometimes, the point in time that a clause relates to is not indicated by an adjunct, but by a <b>subordinate clause</b>. Subordinate clauses of time are introduced by conjunctions which refer to time, such as 'since', 'until', 'before' and 'after'.</p>
<p>For information about the tense of the verb in the subordinate clause, see paragraph <b>8.9</b>.</p>
