<p class="subTitle">10.59 distancing and qualifying</p>
<p>There are a number of sentence adjuncts which have the effect of showing that you are not completely committed to the truth of your statement.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>Rats eat</i> <b>practically</b> <i>anything</i>.</li>
	<li><i>It was</i> <b>almost</b> <i>a relief when the race was over</i>.</li>
	<li><i>They are</i>, <b>in effect</b>, <i>still trapped in a history which they do not understand</i>.</li>
	<li><b>In a way</b> <i>I liked her better than Mark</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following adjuncts are used in this way:</p>
<ul>
	<li class="c_list"><b>almost, in a manner of speaking, in a way, in effect, more or less, practically, so to speak, to all intents and purposes, to some extent, up to a point, virtually</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Note that 'almost', 'practically', and 'virtually' are not used at the beginning of a clause.</p>
<p>Expressions such as 'I think', 'I believe', and 'I suppose' are also used to indicate your lack of commitment to the truth of what you are saying.</p>
