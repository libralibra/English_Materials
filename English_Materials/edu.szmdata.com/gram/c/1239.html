<p class="subTitle">9.21 referring to what is mentioned</p>
<p>You can also refer back to actions and events using nouns which also show your feelings about the action or event. For example, if you use the noun 'incident' to refer to an accident at a nuclear power station, this appears to simply describe the event, whereas if you use the noun 'disaster', this shows your reaction to the event.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>There might be an uncomfortable moment or two when Gwen learned of his intention, but she was not the kind to make a fuss. In any event, he could handle the</i> <b>situation</b>, <i>which would not be a new one</i>.</li>
	<li><i>I believed the press would cooperate on this</i> <b>issue</b>.</li>
	<li><i>Parents may complain that their child eats badly at meals but is always begging for food between meals. This</i> <b>problem</b> <i>doesn't arise because the parents have been lenient about food between meals</i>.</li>
	<li><i>He entered his name for the Boxing Day race, which to Belinda's delight he subsequently won. She seemed for some reason to regard the</i> <b>exploit</b> <i>as reflecting credit on herself</i>.</li>
