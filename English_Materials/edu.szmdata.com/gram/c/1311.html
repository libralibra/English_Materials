<p class="subTitle">10.39 using link verbs</p>
<p>A common way of commenting on what you are doing or experiencing is to use 'it' followed by a <b>link verb</b> and a <b>complement</b>. After the complement you use a <b>present participle</b> or a <b>'to'-infinitive</b> clause.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>It's fun working for him</i>.</li>
	<li><i>It was difficult trying to talk to her</i>.</li>
	<li><i>It's nice to see you with your books for a change</i>.</li>
	<li><i>It will be a stimulating experience to see Mrs Oliver</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to mention the person who performs the action or has the experience, you use a <b>prepositional phrase</b> beginning with 'for' and a 'to'-infinitive clause after the complement.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>It becomes hard for a child to develop a sense of identity</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also use the structure with a 'to'-infinitive clause when you are recommending a course of action or saying that something is necessary.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>It's important to know your own limitations</i>.</li>
	<li><i>It's a good idea to have a little notebook handy</i>.</li>
	<li><i>It is necessary to examine this claim before we proceed any further</i>.</li>
</ul>
