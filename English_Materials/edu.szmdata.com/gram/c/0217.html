<p class="subTitle">2.20 attributive position</p>
<p>Most adjectives can be used to modify nouns. This is called the <b>attributive</b> position.</p>
<p class="clgm_hw">2.21</p>
<p>The other main structure involves adjectives being used as <b>complements</b> after <b>link verbs</b>. Placing an adjective after a link verb has the effect of focusing attention on the adjective. If you say 'The suitcase she was carrying was old and battered', your main purpose is to describe the suitcase, so the focus is on the adjectives 'old' and 'battered'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>Davis is</i> <b>dead</b>.</li>
	<li><i>The house was</i> <b>quiet</b>.</li>
	<li><i>He became</i> <b>angry</b>.</li>
	<li><i>I feel</i> <b>cold</b>.</li>
	<li><i>Nobody seemed</i> <b>amused</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The use of adjectives as complements of link verbs is explained in paragraphs <b>3.133 to 3.138</b>.</p>
