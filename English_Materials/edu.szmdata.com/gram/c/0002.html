<p class="subTitle">1.1 Introduction to the noun group</p>
<p>At its simplest, we use language to talk about people and things. We do this by using words in a variety of ways, for example to make statements, to ask questions, and to give orders. The words we choose are arranged into groups, either around a noun or around a verb. They are called <b>noun groups</b> and <b>verb groups</b>.</p>
<p><b>Noun groups</b> tell us which people or things are being talked about. <b>Verb groups</b> tell us what is being said about them, for example what they are doing.</p>
