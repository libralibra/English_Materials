<p class="subTitle">10.5 impersonal 'it'</p>
<p>When you want to say something about a fact, an action, or a particular state, you can use a structure beginning with 'it', for example 'It's strange that he didn't call', 'It's easy to laugh', and 'It's no fun being stupid'.</p>
<p>You also use an 'it' structure to talk about the weather or the time, for example 'It's raining', 'It's a nice day', and 'It's two o'clock'.</p>
<p>'It' structures are dealt with in the section beginning at paragraph 10.31.</p>
