<p class="subTitle">7.92 nominal use of 'wh'-clauses</p>
<p>When you want to refer to matters which are not certain or definite, or about which a choice has to be made, you can use clauses beginning with a 'wh'-word or 'whether', like the clauses used for <b>reported questions</b>. They can be used after prepositions, and as the subject of verbs such as 'be', 'depend', and 'matter'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>...the question of</i> <b>who should be President of the Board of Trade</b>.</li>
	<li><i>The State is desperately uncertain about</i> <b>what it wants artists to do</b>.</li>
	<li><b>What you get</b> <i>depends on</i> <b>how badly you were injured</b>.</li>
	<li><b>Whether I went twice or not</b> <i>doesn't matter</i>.</li>
	<li><b>Whether you think they are any good or not</b> <i>is irrelevant</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p class="clgm_hw">7.93</p>
<p>Structures consisting of a 'wh'-word plus a 'to'-infinitive clause, which refer to a possible course of action, are used after prepositions but not usually as subjects.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>...the problem of</i> <b>what to tell the adopted child</b>.</li>
	<li><i>...a book on</i> <b>how to avoid having a heart attack</b>.</li>
	<li><i>People are very worried about</i> <b>how to fill their increased leisure time</b>.</li>
</ul>
