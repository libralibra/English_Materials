<p class="subTitle">2.1 Introduction</p>
<p>In the previous chapter the use of nouns, pronouns, and the basic determiners to name and identify people and things was explained. This chapter explains ways of giving more information about the people and things that have already been named or identified.</p>
<p>One way of giving more information within a noun group about people or things is by the use of an <b>adjective</b> such as 'small', 'political', and 'blue'. Adjectives can be used as modifiers of a noun or as complements of a link verb. They are explained in paragraphs <b>2.2 to 2.173</b>.</p>
<p>Sometimes nouns can also be used to modify the headword. This is explained in paragraphs <b>2.174 to 2.179</b>.</p>
<p><b>Possessives</b> such as 'grandmother's' are used to indicate the relationship between people and things and the headword. They can also be used to modify a noun or as complements of a link verb. They are explained in paragraphs <b>2.180 to 2.192</b>.</p>
<p>There are other groups of words which are used before a noun group to give more information about people and things. They are linked to the noun group by 'of' in a <b>partitive structure</b>. These words include <b>quantifiers</b>, such as 'many of' and 'some of', and other <b>partitives</b>such as 'a piece of' and 'a bottle of'. Quantifiers are used to indicate the amount of people or things you are talking about. They are explained in paragraphs <b>2.193 to 2.210</b>. Other partitives are used to indicate a particular amount of people or things. They are explained in paragraphs <b>2.211 to 2.224</b>.</p>
<p><b>Numbers</b> and <b>fractions</b> are also used to indicate the amount of people or things you are talking about. Numbers are explained in paragraphs <b>2.225 to 2.256</b> and fractions are explained in paragraphs <b>2.257 to 2.266</b>.</p>
<p>The other way of giving more information within a noun group about people or things is by using a <b>qualifier</b> after headwords to expand their meaning. Qualifiers are explained in paragraphs <b>2.289 to 2.320</b>.</p>
