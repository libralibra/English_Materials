<p class="subTitle">8.70 USAGE NOTE</p>
<p>When a clause beginning with 'though' ends with a complement, the complement can be brought forward to the beginning of the clause. For example, instead of saying 'Though he was ill, he insisted on coming to the meeting', you can say 'Ill though he was, he insisted on coming to the meeting'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Tempting though it may be to follow this point through</b>, <i>it is not really relevant and we had better move on</i>.</li>
	<li><i>I had to accept the fact</i>, <b>improbable though it was</b>.</li>
	<li><b>Astute business man though he was</b>, <i>Philip was capable at times of extreme recklessness</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>When the complement is an adjective, you can use 'as' instead of 'though'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Stupid as it sounds</b>, <i>I was so in love with her that I believed her</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>When a clause beginning with 'though' ends with an adverb, you can often put the adverb at the beginning of the clause.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>Some members of the staff couldn't handle Murray's condition</i>, <b>hard though they tried</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>When you are talking about a strong feeling or desire, you can use 'much as' instead of 'although' and an adjunct. For example, instead of saying 'Although I like Venice very much, I couldn't live there' you can say 'Much as I like Venice, I couldn't live there'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Much as they admired her looks and her manners</b>, <i>they had no wish to marry her</i>.</li>
</ul>
