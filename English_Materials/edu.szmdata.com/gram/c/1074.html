<p class="subTitle">7.67 USAGE NOTE</p>
<p>There are a few expressions containing impersonal 'it' which are used as reporting clauses before 'that'-clauses to indicate that someone suddenly thought of something: 'It occurred to me', 'It struck me', and 'It crossed my mind'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>It occurred to him</b> <i>that he hadn't eaten anything since the night before his capture</i>.</li>
	<li><b>It crossed my mind</b> <i>that somebody must have been keeping things secret</i>.</li>
</ul>
