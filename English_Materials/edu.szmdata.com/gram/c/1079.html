<p class="subTitle">7.72 verbs with or without the hearer as object</p>
<p>After a few reporting verbs that refer to speech, you can choose whether or not to mention the hearer.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>I promised that I would try to phone her</i>.</li>
	<li><i>I promised</i> <b>Myra</b> <i>I'd be home at seven</i>.</li>
	<li><i>The physicians warned that, without the operation, the child would die</i>.</li>
	<li><i>Thomas warned</i> <b>her</b> <i>that his mother was slightly deaf</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is a list of reporting verbs which can be used with or without the hearer as object when used with a 'that'-clause:</p>
<ul>
	<li class="c_list"><b>ask, promise, teach, warn'Promise' can also be used with or without an object when it is used with a 'to'-infinitive clause. 'Ask' has to be used with an object when it is used with a 'to'-infinitive clause to report a request for the hearer to do something, but it is used without an object when the request is for permission to do something (see paragraphs 7.36 and 7.39).</b></li>
</ul>
