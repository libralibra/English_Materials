<p class="subTitle">3.119 WARNING</p>
<p>It is important to realize that you cannot always guess the meaning of a compound verb if you are not already familiar with it. For example, to 'soft-soap' does not mean to use soap which is soft; it means to flatter someone in order to persuade them to do something for you.</p>
