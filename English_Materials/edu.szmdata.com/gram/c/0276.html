<p class="subTitle">2.114 comparatives as headwords</p>
<p>Comparative adjectives are sometimes used as headwords in fairly formal English. When you use a comparative adjective as a headword, you put 'the' in front of it, and follow it with 'of' and a noun group which refers to the two things being compared.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i></i>...<b>the shorter of the two lines</b>.</li>
	<li><i>Dorothea was</i> <b>the more beautiful of the two</b>.</li>
	<li><i>There are two windmills</i>, <b>the larger of which</b> <i>stands a hundred and fifty feet high</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>If it is clear what you are talking about, you can omit 'of' and the following noun group.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>Notice to quit must cover the rental period or four weeks</i>, <i>whichever is</i> <b>the longer</b>.</li>
</ul>
