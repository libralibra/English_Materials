<p class="subTitle">3.170 describing and naming</p>
<p>If you want to say that people use a particular word, word group, or name to describe or refer to someone or something, you can use the word, word group, or name as the complement of one of a group of transitive verbs.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>People who did not like him</i> <b>called him dull</b>.</li>
	<li><i>They</i> <b>called him an idiot</b>.</li>
	<li><i>Everyone</i> <b>called her Molly</b>.</li>
	<li><i>He got his trial and</i> <b>was declared innocent</b>.</li>
	<li><i>They</i> <b>named the place 'Tumbo Kutu'</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is a list of verbs which can be used in this way. The first group can have an adjective as their complement; the second group can have a noun group as their complement; and the third group can have a name as their complement.</p>
<ul>
	<li class="c_list"><b>call, certify, declare, label, pronounce, term,  --- , brand, call, declare, designate, label, proclaim, term,  --- , call, christen, dub, name, nickname</b></li>
</ul>
