<p class="subTitle">7.66 'seem' and 'appear'</p>
<p>If you want to say that something appears to be the case, you can use either of the verbs 'seem' and 'appear'. These verbs can be used as reporting verbs followed by a 'that'-clause or they can be used with a 'to'-infinitive clause. You can be giving your own opinion or that of someone else.</p>
<p>If you want to mention an apparent fact, you can use 'seem' or 'appear', followed by a 'that'-clause. The subject of 'seem' or 'appear' is 'it', used impersonally.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>It seemed that she had not been careful enough</i>.</li>
	<li><i>It seemed that he had lost his chance to win</i>.</li>
	<li><i>It appears that he followed my advice</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Alternatively, you can use a phase structure involving 'seem' or 'appear' and a 'to'-infinitive clause. The main person or thing involved in the fact that appears to be true is put as the subject of the reporting verb.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>She seemed to like me</i>.</li>
	<li><i>He appears to have been an interesting man</i>.</li>
	<li><i>The system appears to work impartially</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to mention the person whose viewpoint you are giving, you can add a prepositional phrase beginning with 'to' after 'seem' or 'appear'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>It seemed</i> <b>to him</b> <i>that I was not yet suitable</i>.</li>
	<li><i>It seems</i> <b>to me</b> <i>to be a remarkable pronouncement</i>.</li>
</ul>
