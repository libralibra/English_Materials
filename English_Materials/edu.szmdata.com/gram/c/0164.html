<p class="subTitle">1.190 using 'those' instead of 'the'</p>
<p>In more formal English, 'those' can be used instead of 'the' in front of a plural noun when the plural noun is followed by a <b>relative clause</b>. In this use, the relative clause specifies exactly which group of people or things are being referred to.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i></i>...<b>those workers who are employed in large enterprises</b>.</li>
	<li><i>The parents are not afraid to be firm about</i> <b>those matters that seem important to them</b>.</li>
</ul>
