<p class="subTitle">1.22 singular form with plural meaning</p>
<p>The names of many animals and birds have two forms, one singular and one plural. However, when you are referring to them in the context of hunting or when you are saying that there are large numbers of them, it is quite common to use the form without '-s', even though you are referring to several animals or birds.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>They hunted</i> <b>gazelle</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that the plural form of the verb is used when several animals or birds are the subject of the sentence, even if you use the form without '-s'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Zebra are</b> <i>a more difficult prey</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Similarly, when you are referring to a large number of trees or plants growing together, you can use the singular form of their name. When you are referring to a small number or to individual trees or plants, you usually use the form with '-s'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>...the rows of</i> <b>willow</b> <i>and</i> <b>cypress</b> <i>which lined the creek</i>.</li>
	<li><i>...the</i> <b>poplars</b> <i>and</i> <b>willows</b> <i>along the Peshawar Road</i>.</li>
</ul>
