<p class="subTitle">6.53 Giving information about place: prepositions</p>
<p>This section explains how to indicate the place where an action occurs, the place where someone or something is, the place they are going to or coming from, or the direction they are moving in.</p>
<p>This usually involves using a <b>prepositional phrase</b> as an <b>adjunct</b>. For general information on adjuncts, see paragraphs <b>6.1 to 6.15</b>.</p>
<p>A <b>prepositional phrase</b> consists of a <b>preposition</b> and its <b>object</b>, which is nearly always a noun group.</p>
<p>The most basic use of most prepositions is to indicate position and direction.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>He fumbled</i> <b>in his pocket</b>.</li>
	<li><b>On your left</b> <i>is the river</i>.</li>
	<li><i>Why did he not drive</i> <b>to Valence?</b></li>
	<li><i>The voice was coming</i> <b>from my apartment</b>.</li>
	<li><i>I ran inside and bounded</i> <b>up the stairs</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p class="clgm_hw">6.54</p>
<p>A <b>preposition</b> is a word which opens up the possibilities of saying more about a thing or an action, because you can choose any appropriate noun group after it as its object. Most prepositions are single words, although there are some that consist of more than one word such as 'out of' and 'in between'.</p>
<p>Here is a list of common one-word prepositions which are used to talk about place or destination:</p>
<ul>
	<li class="c_list"><b>about, above, across, along, alongside, among, around, at, before, behind, below, beneath, beside, between, beyond, by, down, from, in, inside, into, near, off, on, opposite, outside, over, past, round, through, throughout, to, towards, under, underneath, up, within</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Here is a list of prepositions which consist of more than one word and which are used to talk about place or destination:</p>
<ul>
	<li class="c_list"><b>ahead of, all over, away from, close by, close to, in between, in front of, near to, next to, on top of, out of</b></li>
</ul>
<p class="clgm_hw">6.55</p>
<p>Many prepositions can also be adverbs, that is, they can be used without an object. See paragraph <b>6.83</b> for a list of these.</p>
