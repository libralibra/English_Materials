<p class="subTitle">8.182 Emphasizing coordinating conjunctions</p>
<p>When you are using coordinating conjunctions, you sometimes want to emphasize that what you are saying applies to both the word groups linked by the conjunction. You usually do this by putting a word such as 'both' or 'neither' in front of the first word group.</p>
<p class="clgm_hw">8.183</p>
<p>When you are using 'and', the most common way of emphasizing that what you are saying applies to two word groups is to put 'both' in front of the first word group.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>By that time</i> <b>both</b> <i>Robin</i> <b>and</b> <i>Drew were overseas</i>.</li>
	<li><i>They feel</i> <b>both</b> <i>anxiety</i> <b>and</b> <i>joy</i>.</li>
	<li><i>These headlines</i> <b>both</b> <i>mystified</i> <b>and</b> <i>infuriated him</i>.</li>
	<li><i>Investment continues</i> <b>both</b> <i>at home</i> <b>and</b> <i>abroad</i>.</li>
	<li><i>Because the medicine is</i> <b>both</b> <i>expensive</i> <b>and</b> <i>in great demand, huge profits can be made</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Another way is to use 'and also' instead of 'and'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>Wilkins drove racing cars himself</i> <b>and also</b> <i>raced powerboats</i>.</li>
	<li><i>The job of the library is to get books to people</i> <b>and also</b> <i>to get information to them</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p class="clgm_hw">8.184</p>
<p>For stronger emphasis, you can put 'not only' or 'not just' in front of the first word group, and 'but' or 'but also' between the two groups.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>The effortless freshness and spontaneity of his singing put him into the front rank of popular singers</i>, <b>not only</b> <i>of the present time</i> <b>but</b> <i>of any time</i>.</li>
	<li><i>Employers have got to think more seriously</i> <b>not only</b> <i>of attracting staff</i>, <b>but</b> <i>of keeping them</i>.</li>
	<li><i>Professor Kleber suggests that law enforcement activities should be directed</i> <b>not just</b> <i>at drug importers and main suppliers</i>, <b>but also</b> <i>at local dealers</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p class="clgm_hw">8.185</p>
<p>When you are using 'or', the most common way of emphasizing that what you are saying applies to two word groups is to put 'either' in front of the first word group.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>Sentences can be</i> <b>either</b> <i>true</i> <b>or</b> <i>false</i>.</li>
	<li><i>You can</i> <b>either</b> <i>buy a special insecticide</i> <b>or</b> <i>get help from an expert</i>.</li>
	<li><b>Either</b> <i>Margaret</i> <b>or</b> <i>John should certainly have come to see me by now</i>.</li>
	<li><b>Either</b> <i>we raise money from outside</i> <b>or</b> <i>we face unpalatable options such as closing part of the museum</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>When you are linking clauses in this way, you can use 'or else', instead of 'or'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>If you can't iron them at once</i>, <b>either</b> <i>roll up the sheets while they are damp</i> <b>or else</b> <i>damp them before you iron them</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p class="clgm_hw">8.186</p>
<p>If you want to emphasize that a negative statement applies to two word groups, you put 'neither' in front of the first group and 'nor' in front of the second group.</p>
<p>For example, instead of saying 'The girl did not speak or look up', you say 'The girl neither spoke nor looked up'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>The thought</i> <b>neither</b> <i>distressed</i> <b>nor</b> <i>delighted her</i>.</li>
	<li><i>She had</i> <b>neither</b> <i>received</i> <b>nor</b> <i>read the letter</i>.</li>
	<li><b>Neither</b> <i>Margaret</i> <b>nor</b> <i>John was there</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that you use a singular verb after singular noun groups and a plural verb after plural noun groups.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>Neither Binta nor anyone else</i> <b>was</b> <i>going to speak</i>.</li>
	<li><i>Neither city councils nor wealthy manufacturers</i> <b>have</b> <i>much need of painters or sculptors</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note also that you cannot put a complete finite clause after 'nor'. For example, you cannot say 'Neither Mary has called nor I know where she is'.</p>
<p class="clgm_hw">8.187</p>
<p>Sometimes you want to draw attention to a clause or word group by contrasting it with something different. One way to do this is to link the two elements by putting 'but' between them. You put 'not' in front of the first element.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>We wept</i>, <b>not</b> <i>because we were frightened</i> <b>but</b> <i>because we were so dirty</i>.</li>
	<li><i>He was</i> <b>not</b> <i>galloping</i> <b>but</b> <i>quietly trotting</i>.</li>
	<li><i>I felt</i> <b>not</b> <i>jubilation</i> <b>but</b> <i>sadness</i>.</li>
	<li><i>The upright chairs were</i> <b>not</b> <i>polished</i> <b>but</b> <i>painted</i>.</li>
</ul>
