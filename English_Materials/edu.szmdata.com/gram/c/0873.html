<p class="subTitle">5.76 'still' for existing situations</p>
<p>If you want to say that a situation exists up to the present time, you use 'still'. If you are using 'be' as a main verb or an auxiliary verb, you put 'still' after 'be' or the auxiliary. If you are using any simple verb except 'be' you put 'still' in front of the verb. 'Still' often suggests that the continuation of the situation is surprising or undesirable.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>It's a marvel that I'm</i> <b>still</b> <i>alive to tell the tale</i>.</li>
	<li><i>Male prejudice</i> <b>still</b> <i>exists in certain quarters</i>.</li>
	<li><i>Years had passed and they were</i> <b>still</b> <i>paying them off</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>In negative statements which use the 'n't' contraction, 'still' is placed in front of 'be' or the auxiliary.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>We've been working on it for over two years now. And it</i> <b>still isn't</b> <i>finished</i>.</li>
	<li><i>We</i> <b>still don't know</b> <i>where we're going</i>.</li>
</ul>
