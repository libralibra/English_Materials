<p class="subTitle">8.60 USAGE NOTE</p>
<p>When the verb in the main clause is 'be' or when an auxiliary is used, the normal order of words is often changed for greater emphasis. 'So' is put at the beginning of the sentence, followed by the adjective, adverb, or noun group. 'Be' or the auxiliary is placed in front of the subject.</p>
<p>For example, instead of saying 'The room was so tiny that you could not get a bed into it', you can say 'So tiny was the room that you could not get a bed into it'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>So</b> <i>successful have they been</i> <b>that they are moving to Bond Street</b>.</li>
	<li><b>So</b> <i>rapid is the rate of progress</i> <b>that advance seems to be following advance on almost a monthly basis</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p class="clgm_hw">8.61</p>
<p>'Such' and 'that' are also used to say that a result happens because something has a quality to a particular extent. You put 'such' in front of a noun group, and then add a 'that'-clause.</p>
<p>If the noun in the noun group is a singular count noun, you put 'a' or 'an' in front of it.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>I slapped her hand and she got</i> <b>such</b> <i>a shock</i> <b>that she dropped the bag</b>.</li>
	<li><i>If you tell them I'm prepared to give evidence they'll get</i> <b>such</b> <i>a scare</i> <b>they'll drop the whole thing</b>.</li>
	<li><i>They obeyed him with</i> <b>such</b> <i>willingness</i> <b>that the strike went on for over a year</b>.</li>
	<li><i>These birds have</i> <b>such</b> <i>small wings</i> <b>that they cannot get into the air even if they try</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p class="clgm_hw">8.62</p>
<p>'Such' can be used in a similar structure as an adjective with the meaning 'so great'. The 'that'-clause goes immediately after it.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>The extent of the disaster was</i> <b>such that the local authorities were quite unable to cope</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sometimes 'such' is put at the beginning of a sentence, followed by 'be', a noun group, and the 'that'-clause. For example, instead of saying 'Her beauty was such that they could only stare', you can say 'Such was her beauty that they could only stare'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Such</b> <i>is the power of suggestion</i> <b>that within a very few minutes she fell asleep</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p class="clgm_hw">8.63</p>
<p>You can also use 'such' as an adjective to say that a result is obtained by something being of a particular kind. 'Such' is followed by a 'that'-clause or by 'as' and a 'to'-infinitive clause.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>The machine's design should be</i> <b>such that its internal parts could be employed in a variety of ways</b>.</li>
	<li><i>The improvements to our defence had been</i> <b>such as to put invasion right out of the question</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can use the expression 'in such a way' to say that a result is obtained by something being done in a particular way. It is followed by a 'that'-clause or by 'as' and a 'to'-infinitive clause.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>She had been taught to behave</i> <b>in such a way that her parents would have as quiet a life as possible</b>.</li>
	<li><i>Is it right that this high tax should be spent</i> <b>in such a way as to give benefit mainly to the motorist?</b></li>
</ul>
<p class="clgm_hw">8.64</p>
<p>You use 'otherwise', 'else', or 'or else' to say that a result of something not happening or not being the case would be that something else would happen or be the case.</p>
<p>For example, 'Give me back my money, otherwise I'll ring the police' means 'If you don't give me back my money, I'll ring the police'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>I'm not used to living on my own so I want a house I'll like</i>, <b>otherwise</b> <i>I'll get depressed</i>.</li>
	<li><i>I must have done something wrong</i>, <b>or else</b> <i>they wouldn't have kept me here</i>.</li>
</ul>
