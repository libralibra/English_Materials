<p class="subTitle">7.45 reporting uncertain things</p>
<p>When you are reporting an action that someone is wondering about doing themselves, you can use a 'to'-infinitive clause beginning with 'whether'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>I've been wondering</i> <b>whether to retire</b>.</li>
	<li><i>He didn't know</i> <b>whether to feel glad or sorry at his dismissal</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is a list of verbs that can be used with 'to'-infinitive clauses of this kind:</p>
<ul>
	<li class="c_list"><b>choose, debate, decide, know, wonder</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Note that 'choose', 'decide', and 'know' are usually used in a negative or interrogative clause, or a clause with a modal.</p>
<p>When you are mentioning information about something involved in an action, you can use a 'to'-infinitive clause after a 'wh'-word as the reported clause.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>I asked him</i> <b>what to do</b>.</li>
	<li><i>I shall teach you</i> <b>how to cook</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is a list of verbs which can be used with 'to'-infinitive clauses of this kind:</p>
<ul>
	<li class="c_list"><b>describe, discover, discuss, explain, forget, guess, imagine, know, learn, realize, remember, reveal, say, see, suggest, teach, tell, think, understand, wonder</b></li>
</ul>
<p>As an alternative to both kinds of 'to'-infinitive clause, you can use a clause containing 'should'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>I wondered</i> <b>whether I should call for help</b>.</li>
	<li><i>He began to wonder</i> <b>what he should do now</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>All the verbs in the above lists, except 'choose' and 'debate', can also be used with ordinary clauses beginning with 'whether' or 'wh'-words. See paragraphs <b>7.32 to 7.35</b>.</p>
