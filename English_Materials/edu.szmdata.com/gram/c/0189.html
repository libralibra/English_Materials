<p class="subTitle">1.219 using individuals to generalize</p>
<p>You can use 'a' or 'an' with a noun when you are using one individual person or thing to make a general statement about all people or things of that type. For example, if you say 'A gun must be kept in a safe place', you are talking about an individual gun in order to make a general statement about all guns.</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>A computer</b> <i>can only do what you program it to do</i>.</li>
	<li><b>A dog</b> <i>likes to eat far more meat than</i> <b>a human being</b>.</li>
	<li><b>An unemployed married farm-worker</b> <i>got parish relief</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is not the usual way of referring to groups. Normally, if you want to make a statement about all the people or things of a particular kind, you use the plural form of a noun without a determiner. See paragraph <b>1.212</b> for more information about this.</p>
