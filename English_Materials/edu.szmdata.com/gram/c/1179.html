<p class="subTitle">8.134 Other structures used like non-finite clauses</p>
<p>Phrases which do not contain a verb are sometimes used in writing in a similar way to non-finite clauses.</p>
<p class="clgm_hw">8.135</p>
<p>In writing, you can add a phrase containing one or more adjectives to a sentence. This is another way of making two statements in one sentence.</p>
<p>For example, instead of writing 'We were tired and hungry. We reached the farm', you could write 'Tired and hungry, we reached the farm'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Surprised at my reaction</b>, <i>she tried to console me</i>.</li>
	<li><b>Much discouraged</b>, <i>I moved on to Philadelphia</i>.</li>
	<li><i>The boy nodded</i>, <b>pale and scared</b>.</li>
	<li><i>He knocked at the door</i>, <b>sick with fear and embarrassment</b>.</li>
	<li><i>'Of course,' said Ash</i>, <b>astonished</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p class="clgm_hw">8.136</p>
<p>In a similar way, you can use a phrase to describe something which is connected with the subject of a sentence. The phrase consists of a noun group, followed by an adjective, an adjunct, or another noun group.</p>
<p>For example, instead of writing 'He came into the room. His hat was in his hand', you could write 'He came into the room, his hat in his hand'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>'What do you mean by that?' said Hugh</i>, <b>his face pale</b>.</li>
	<li><i>She stood very erect</i>, <b>her body absolutely stiff with fury</b>.</li>
	<li><i>He was waiting, drumming with his fingers</i>, <b>his eyes on his napkin</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>'With' is sometimes added at the beginning of a phrase.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>She walked on</i>, <b>with her eyes straight ahead</b>.</li>
	<li><i>It was a hot, calm day</i>, <b>with every object at the sea's surface visible for miles</b>.</li>
</ul>
