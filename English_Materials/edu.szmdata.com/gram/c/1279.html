<p class="subTitle">10.3 passive voice</p>
<p>One way of varying the sequence of elements in the clause is to use the <b>passive voice</b>. The passive voice allows you to talk about an event from the point of view of the thing or person affected, and even to avoid mentioning who or what was responsible for the action.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>Betty Williams and Mairead Corrigan</i> <b>were awarded</b> <i>the Nobel Peace Prize</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The passive is explained in paragraphs 10.8 to 10.24.</p>
