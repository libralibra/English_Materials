<p class="subTitle">1.153 Other pronouns</p>
<p>Many other words can be pronouns, provided that it is clear what is being talked about, because it is then unnecessary to repeat the headword.</p>
<p>For example, most <b>general determiners</b> can also be also pronouns. For more information about general determiners, see paragraphs <b>1.208 to 1.235</b>.</p>
<p>Here is a list of general determiners which are also pronouns:</p>
<ul>
	<li class="c_list"><b>all, another, any, both, each, either, enough, few, fewer, less, little, many, more, most, much, neither, none, others, several, some</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Like all noun groups, they can be used as the subject, direct object, or indirect object of a clause, or the object of a preposition.</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Both</b> <i>were offered jobs immediately</i>.</li>
	<li><i>Discuss it with your female colleagues, if you have</i> <b>any</b>.</li>
	<li><i>I saw one girl whispering to</i> <b>another</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p class="clgm_hw">1.154</p>
<p>Although 'a', 'an', 'every', and 'no' are general determiners, they cannot stand alone as pronouns.</p>
<p>To refer back to a noun group which includes the determiner 'a' or 'an', you can use the pronoun 'one'. Similarly, you use 'each' to refer back to a noun group which includes 'every', and 'none' to refer back to a noun group which includes 'no'.</p>
<p>Note that 'another' and 'others' are pronouns, but 'other' cannot be a pronoun.</p>
