<p class="subTitle">7.13 negatives in reporting clauses</p>
<p>With a small number of reporting verbs, the negative is often expressed in the reporting clause rather than in the reported clause. 'I don't think Mary is at home' means the same as 'I think Mary is not at home', and 'She doesn't want to see him' means 'She wants not to see him'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>I</i> <b>do not think</b> <i>she suspects me</i>.</li>
	<li><i>She</i> <b>didn't believe</b> <i>she would ever see him again</i>.</li>
	<li><i>He</i> <b>didn't want</b> <i>to go</i>.</li>
	<li><i>We</i> <b>don't intend</b> <i>to put him on trial</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is a list of reporting verbs which are often used with a negative in this way:</p>
<ul>
	<li class="c_list"><b>believe, expect, feel, imagine, intend, plan, propose, reckon, suppose, think, want, wish</b></li>
</ul>
