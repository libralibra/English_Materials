<p class="subTitle">9.34 'same'</p>
<p>The adjective 'same' is used attributively to indicate emphatically that you are referring back to something that has just been mentioned.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>We accept that thought is a common property of the human race. But we cannot make the</i> <b>same</b> <i>assumption about machines</i>.</li>
	<li><i>The door opened and a man popped his head into the room and said 'Next please'. About ten minutes later, the</i> <b>same</b> <i>man returned</i>.</li>
	<li><i>He watched her climb into a compartment of the train and he chose the</i> <b>same</b> <i>one so as to watch her more closely</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that when 'same' is used attributively, it nearly always follows 'the', but it can occasionally follow other specific determiners.</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>These same</b> <i>smells may produce depression in others</i>.</li>
