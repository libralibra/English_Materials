<p class="subTitle">8.33 USAGE NOTE</p>
<p>A more formal way of talking about a possible future situation is to use 'should' in the conditional clause. For example, instead of saying 'If anything happens, I will return immediately', you can say 'If anything should happen, I will return immediately'. In the main clause you use a modal, usually 'will' or 'would'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>If anyone</i> <b>should</b> <i>come this way, we</i> <b>would</b> <i>be caught like rats in a trap</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Another way of talking about a possible future situation is to use 'were' and a 'to'-infinitive in a conditional clause. For example, instead of saying 'If he goes, I will go too', you can say 'If he were to go, I would go too'. In the main clause you use 'would', 'should', or 'might'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>If we</i> <b>were to move</b> <i>north, we</i> <b>would</b> <i>be able to buy a bigger house</i>.</li>
</ul>
