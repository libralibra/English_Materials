<p class="subTitle">4.115 regularity in the past: 'would'</p>
<p>'Would' is used to talk about something that happened regularly in the past, but no longer happens.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>She</i> <b>would</b> <i>sit crosslegged in her red robes</i>.</li>
	<li><i>A man with a list</i> <b>would</b> <i>come round and say you could go off duty</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>When you use 'would' like this, you often add an <b>adjunct of time</b>.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>She would</i> <b>often</b> <i>hear him grumbling</i>.</li>
	<li><b>Once in a while</b> <i>she'd give me some lilac to take home</i>.</li>
	<li><b>Every day</b> <i>I'd ring up home and asked if they'd changed their minds</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can use 'used to' instead of 'would'. 'Used to' is dealt with in paragraphs <b>4.258 to 4.262</b>.</p>
