<p class="subTitle">9.64 ellipsis in questions</p>
<p>You can often use ellipsis in questions when the context makes it clear what is meant. The question can consist just of a <b>'wh'-word</b>.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>'There's someone coming.' --- </i><b>'Who?'</b><i> --- 'I don't know. It's too dark and there's snow falling.'</i></li>
	<li><i>'But I'm afraid there's more.' --- </i><b>'What?'</b></li>
	<li><i>'Can I speak to you?' I asked, undaunted. --- </i><b>'Why?'</b><i> --- 'It's important.'</i></li>
	<li><i>'It's opening on the 31st of this month.' --- </i><b>'Where?'</b><i> --- 'At the Railway Hotel.'</i></li>
</ul>
<p>Note that you can also use 'why not'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>'Maria! We won't discuss that here.' --- </i><b>'Why not?'</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Note also that you can use a 'wh'-word after a report verb, especially 'why'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>I asked</i> <b>why</b>.</li>
	<li><i>They enquired</i> <b>how</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p class="clgm_hw">9.65</p>
<p>Other questions can also consist of only a very few words when the context makes it clear what is meant. Short questions of this kind are often used to express surprise or to offer something to someone.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>'Could you please come to Ira's right away and help me out?' --- </i><b>'Now? Tonight?'</b><i> --- 'It's incredibly important.'</i></li>
	<li><i>'Does she drink? Heavily, I mean.' --- '</i><b>Drink?</b> <i>No, she never touches the stuff.'</i></li>
	<li><i>'He's going to die, you see.' --- '</i><b>Die?'</b></li>
	<li><b>'Cup of coffee?'</b> <i>Lionel asked, kindly</i>.</li>
	<li><i>He drank the water and handed me the glass</i>. <b>'More?'</b><i>'No, that's just fine, thank you.'</i></li>
</ul>
