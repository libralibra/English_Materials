<p class="subTitle">5.78 'yet' for expected situations</p>
<p>If you want to indicate that something has not happened up to the present time, but is likely to happen in the future, you use 'yet' with a negative. 'Yet' usually comes at the end of a sentence.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>We don't know the terms</i> <b>yet</b>.</li>
	<li><i>I haven't set any work</i> <b>yet</b>. <i>I suppose I shall some day</i>.</li>
	<li><i>They haven't heard</i> <b>yet</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to sound more emphatic, you can put 'yet' before a simple verb or after the auxiliary and negative word.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>No one</i> <b>yet knows</b> <i>exactly what it means</i>.</li>
	<li><i>Her style</i> <b>had not yet matured</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>'Yet' can also be used in questions, where it is usually put at the end of the clause.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>Has the Colonel waved his paper</i> <b>yet?</b></li>
	<li><i>Has Mr. Harris not come</i> <b>yet?</b></li>
</ul>
<p class="clgm_hw">5.79</p>
<p>You can also use 'yet' in affirmative statements to say that something that is expected has not happened up to the present time. In this case, 'yet' is followed by a 'to'-infinitive clause.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>The true history of art in post-war America</i> <b>is yet to be written</b>.</li>
	<li><i>He</i> <b>had yet to attempt</b> <i>to put principles into practice</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p class="clgm_hw">5.80</p>
<p>'Yet' is also used in affirmative statements with superlatives to indicate that the statement applies up to the present, but may not apply in the future. 'Yet' normally comes at the end of the clause.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>This is the</i> <b>best</b> <i>museum we've visited</i> <b>yet</b>.</li>
	<li><i>Mr. Fowler said that February had produced the</i> <b>best</b> <i>results</i> <b>yet</b>.</li>
	<li><i>This would be the</i> <b>biggest</b> <i>and</i> <b>best</b> <i>version</i> <b>yet</b>.</li>
</ul>
