<p class="subTitle">1.63 always used with modifiers</p>
<p>Some nouns are always used with a modifier. For example, it is pointless to say that someone is 'an eater' because all people eat, but you may want to say that he or she is 'a meat eater' or 'a messy eater'.</p>
<p>Similarly, if you use 'range' to refer to a particular set of values, you have to specify which set you mean by referring to a particular 'price range' or 'age range'. If you use 'wear' to mean 'clothing', you have to say what sort of clothing, for example 'sports wear' or 'evening wear'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>Tim was</i> <b>a slow eater</b>.</li>
	<li><i>...the other end of</i> <b>the age range</b>.</li>
	<li><i>The company has plans to expand</i> <b>its casual wear</b>.</li>
</ul>
