<p class="subTitle">2.162 Indicating the degree of difference: submodifiers in comparison</p>
<p>When you are using comparative adjectives, you may want to say that something has much more or less of a quality than something else. You can do this by adding a <b>submodifier</b>.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>He is a</i> <b>much better</b> <i>dentist than you</i>.</li>
	<li><i>These creatures are</i> <b>much less mobile</b>.</li>
	<li><i>There are</i> <b>far worse</b> <i>dangers</i>.</li>
	<li><i>Some children are</i> <b>a lot more difficult</b> <i>than others</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also use a submodifier to say that something has much more or much less of a quality than it had before.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>He had become</i> <b>much more mature</b>.</li>
	<li><i>That's</i> <b>much less important</b> <i>than it was</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p class="clgm_hw">2.163</p>
<p>Some submodifiers can only be used when comparative adjectives are being used as complements.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>We'll be getting up</i> <b>a lot higher</b> <i>than this</i>.</li>
	<li><i>It would be</i> <b>a good deal easier</b> <i>if you came to my place</i>.</li>
	<li><i>The journey back was</i> <b>a great deal more unpleasant</b> <i>than the outward one had been</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is a list of submodifiers used in front of comparative adjectives:</p>
<ul>
	<li class="c_list"><b>a good deal, a great deal, a lot, heaps, lots</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Note that 'lots' and 'heaps' are only used in informal spoken English.</p>
<p class="clgm_hw">2.164</p>
<p>However, other submodifiers can be used with comparative adjectives which are being used as either modifiers or complements.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>They are faced with a</i> <b>much harder</b> <i>problem than the rest of us</i>.</li>
	<li><i>Scientific activity is now</i> <b>much greater</b>.</li>
	<li><i>Computers can be applied to a</i> <b>far wider</b> <i>range of tasks</i>.</li>
	<li><i>The process is</i> <b>far simpler</b> <i>than multiplication</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is a list of submodifiers used with adjectives that are used both attributively and predicatively:</p>
<ul>
	<li class="c_list"><b>considerably, far, infinitely, much, vastly, very much</b></li>
</ul>
