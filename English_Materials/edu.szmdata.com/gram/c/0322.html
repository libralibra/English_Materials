<p class="subTitle">2.183 other uses of 's</p>
<p>The use of apostrophe s ('s) is not just restricted to nouns and names or to indicating possession or association. For example, it can be used in a qualifying phrase beginning with the preposition 'of', and it can be used like a possessive pronoun. Some nouns with ''s' added can also be used as modifiers in front of a noun. These other uses of the possessive form are explained in paragraphs <b>2.188 to 2.192</b>.</p>
<p>Note that in addition to being the possessive form, the pattern ''s' can also be added to words as a contraction of 'is' or 'has'.</p>
