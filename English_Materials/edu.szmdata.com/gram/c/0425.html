<p class="subTitle">2.311 with 'to'-infinitive clauses</p>
<p>A 'to'-infinitive clause is often put after nouns in order to show what the thing referred to is intended to do.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>The government of Mexico set up a programme</i> <b>to develop new varieties of wheat</b>.</li>
	<li><i>...a simple device</i> <b>to test lung function</b>.</li>
	<li><i>They need people</i> <b>to work in the factories</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p class="clgm_hw">2.312</p>
<p>You can refer to something or someone that should or can have something done to them by using a clause containing 'to'-infinitive after a noun or indefinite pronoun.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>I make notes in the back of my diary of things</i> <b>to be mended or replaced</b>.</li>
	<li><i>...when I've had something</i> <b>to eat</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also use a clause consisting of a 'to'-infinitive followed by a preposition.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>...a room with nothing in it except a string cot</i> <b>to sleep on</b>, <i>a lectern</i> <b>to write on</b> <i>and two wooden shelves</i>.</li>
	<li><i>He remembered he had nothing</i> <b>to write with</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p class="clgm_hw">2.313</p>
<p>You can also use a 'to'-infinitive clause when you want to say that you are talking about, for example, the first, oldest, or only person who did something.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>...the first woman</i> <b>to be elected to the council</b>.</li>
	<li><i>...the next person</i> <b>to speak</b>.</li>
	<li><i>...the oldest person</i> <b>to be chosen</b>.</li>
	<li><i>I am not</i> <b>the only woman</b> <b>to have found that part-time work has its drawbacks</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p class="clgm_hw">2.314</p>
<p>A clause containing a 'to'-infinitive is used after some abstract nouns to show what action they relate to.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>...people who didn't have the opportunity</i> <b>to go to university</b>.</li>
	<li><i>...trying to think of a way</i> <b>to stop him</b>.</li>
</ul>
