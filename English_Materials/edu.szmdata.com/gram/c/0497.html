<p class="subTitle">3.94 phrasal verbs used transitively and intransitively</p>
<p>A large group of phrasal verbs can be used in intransitive as well as transitive structures.</p>
<p>Often this is because a phrasal verb has more than one meaning. For example, 'break in' is usually intransitive when it is used in the sense of 'get into a place by force'. But 'break in' is transitive when it is used in the sense of 'get someone used to a new situation'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>If the door is locked, I will try to</i> <b>break in</b>.</li>
	<li><i>Brody liked to</i> <b>break in</b> <i>his assistants slowly</i>.</li>
	<li><i>A plane</i> <b>took off</b>.</li>
	<li><i>Gretchen</i> <b>took off</b> <i>her coat</i>.</li>
	<li><i>The engine</i> <b>cut out</b>.</li>
	<li><i>She</i> <b>cut out</b> <i>some coloured photographs from a magazine</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p class="clgm_hw">3.95</p>
<p>Here is a list of phrasal verbs which can be used in intransitive as well as transitive clauses, depending on which meaning is being used:</p>
<ul>
	<li class="c_list"><b>add up, bail out, black out, break in, call in, carry on, clear out, cut out, draw on, draw out, draw up, dress up, drop off, drop round, fight back, finish up, get down, get in, get out, get together, give up, hang out, hold off, hold out, join up, keep away, keep down, keep in, keep off, keep on, keep out, keep up, kick off, knock about, knock off, lay off, leave off, look out, look up, make out, make up, mess about, miss out, pass off, pass on, pay off, pick up, pull in, put in, roll up, run down, run off, run over, set forth, set off, set out, show off, show up, split up, stick out, stick up, stow away, strike out, string along, sum up, switch off, take off, tear off, throw up, tuck in, turn away, turn back, turn in, turn out, turn round, turn up, wind down, wind up, work out, wrap up</b></li>
</ul>
<p class="clgm_hw">3.96</p>
<p>There are a few phrasal verbs which only have one meaning, but which can be either transitive or intransitive. It is possible to use them intransitively because the object is either obvious or can be guessed in a particular context.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>It won't take me a moment to</i> <b>clear away</b>.</li>
	<li><i>Brody began to</i> <b>clear away</b> <i>the soup bowls</i>.</li>
</ul>
