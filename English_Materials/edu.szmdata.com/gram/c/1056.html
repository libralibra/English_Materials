<p class="subTitle">7.43 USAGE NOTE</p>
<p>'Claim' and 'pretend' can also be used with these two structures, when you are saying that someone is claiming or pretending something about himself or herself. For example, 'He claimed to be a genius' has the same meaning as 'He claimed that he was a genius'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>He claimed</i> <b>to have witnessed the accident</b>.</li>
	<li><i>He claimed</i> <b>that he had found the money in the forest</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that the infinitive in the 'to'-infinitive clause can be a perfect infinitive, referring to a past event or situation.</p>
<p class="clgm_hw">7.44</p>
<p>Note that a few verbs which indicate personal intentions can only be used with a 'to'-infinitive clause.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>I intend to say nothing for the present</i>.</li>
	<li><i>They are planning to move to the country</i>.</li>
	<li><i>I don't want to die yet</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is a list of these verbs:</p>
<ul>
	<li class="c_list"><b>intend, long, mean, plan, refuse, want</b></li>
</ul>
