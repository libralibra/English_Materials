<p class="subTitle">8.86 punctuation</p>
<p>A non-defining relative clause usually has a comma in front of it and a comma after it, unless it is at the end of a sentence, in which case you just put a full stop. Dashes are sometimes used instead of commas.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>Sir Denis</i>, <b>who is 78</b>, <i>has let it be known that much of his collection is to be left to the nation</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>You never put a comma or a dash in front of a defining relative clause.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>The woman</i> <b>who owns this cabin</b> <i>will come back in the autumn</i>.</li>
</ul>
