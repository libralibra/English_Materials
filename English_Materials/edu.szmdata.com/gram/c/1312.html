<p class="subTitle">10.40 using other verbs</p>
<p>Similar structures can be used with verbs other than link verbs.</p>
<p>If you want to say what effect an experience has on someone, you can use 'it' with a verb such as 'please', 'surprise', or 'shock', followed by a noun group and a 'to'-infinitive clause. For a list of these verbs, see paragraph 10.44.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>It always pleased him to think of his father</i>.</li>
	<li><i>It surprised him to realize that he hadn't thought about them until now</i>.</li>
	<li><i>It interests him to hear what you've been buying</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can use 'it' with 'take' and a 'to'-infinitive clause to indicate what is used in a particular action or activity, or is needed for it, for example the amount of time or the type of person that is needed.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>It takes an hour to get to Idlewild</i>.</li>
	<li><i>It takes an exceptional parent to cope with a child like that</i>.</li>
	<li><i>It took many wounds to kill them</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>If there is also an <b>indirect object</b>, this can be placed immediately after the verb.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>It took</i> <b>me</b> <i>a year to save up for a new hat</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the indirect object is expressed by a prepositional phrase, usually beginning with 'for', it is placed after the direct object.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>It took some time</i> <b>for him</b> <i>to realize what was required</i>.</li>
	<li><i>It takes a lot more guts</i> <b>for a woman</b> <i>to resign than for a man</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>'Cost' can be used in similar structures when talking about the amount of something, usually money, that is used in an activity.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>It costs about &pound;150 a week to keep someone in prison</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>With 'find' and 'think', you can use 'it' as the object, followed by an <b>object complement</b> and either a 'to'-infinitive clause or a 'that'-clause.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>He found</i> <b>it</b> <i>hard to make friends</i>.</li>
	<li><i>He thought</i> <b>it</b> <i>right to resign immediately</i>.</li>
</ul>
