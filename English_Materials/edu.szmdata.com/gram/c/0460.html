<p class="subTitle">3.41 nouns with no equivalent verb</p>
<p>There are some nouns used in delexical structures which do not correspond in form to a verb which has a similar meaning to the delexical structure. Sometimes there is such a verb, but the form is slightly different.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>Work experience allows students to</i> <b>make more effective career decisions</b>.</li>
	<li><i>The Prime Minister</i> <b>decided</b> <i>she had heard enough</i>.</li>
	<li><i>He</i> <b>made the shortest speech</b> <i>I've ever heard</i>.</li>
	<li><i>Iain</i> <b>spoke</b> <i>candidly about the crash</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>In other cases, there is no corresponding verb with a similar meaning at all and so there is no other structure that can be used.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>He had been out all day</i> <b>taking pictures</b> <i>of the fighting</i>.</li>
	<li><i>That is</i> <b>a very foolish attitude to take</b>.</li>
	<li><i>She</i> <b>made a number of relevant points</b>.</li>
	<li><i>Try not</i> <b>to make so much noise</b>.</li>
</ul>
