<p>You normally form questions with 'used to' by putting 'did' in front of the subject, followed by 'used to'. 'Wh'-questions are formed by putting the 'wh'-word at the beginning, followed by 'used to'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Did you used to</b> <i>play with your trains?</i></li>
	<li><b>What used to</b> <i>annoy you most about him?</i></li>
</ul>
<p>You can form negative questions by putting 'didn't' in front of the subject, followed by the subject and 'used to'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Didn't</b> <i>they</i> <b>used to</b> <i>mind?</i></li>
</ul>
<p>In more formal English, 'did' is put in front of the subject and 'not' after it, followed by 'used to'.</p>
