<p class="subTitle">9.53 'be' as a main verb</p>
<p>However, the link verb 'be' is repeated, in an appropriate form. For example, 'I was scared and the children were too'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>'I think you're right.' --- 'I'm sure I</i> <b>am.'</b></li>
</ul>
<p>If the second verb group contains a modal, you usually put 'be' after the modal.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>'Bit of an unfair question to ask me, because I</i><b>'m</b> <i>biased.' --- 'Thought you</i> <b>might be.'</b></li>
	<li><i>'He thought that it</i> <b>was</b> <i>hereditary in his case.' --- 'Well, it</i> <b>might be.'</b></li>
</ul>
<p>However, this is not necessary if the first verb group also contains a modal.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>I</i><b>'ll</b> <i>be back as soon as I</i> <b>can</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>'Be' is sometimes used after a modal in the second mention to contrast with another link verb such as 'seem', 'look', or 'sound'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>'It</i> <b>looks</b> <i>like tea to me.' --- 'Yes, it</i> <b>could be.'</b></li>
</ul>
