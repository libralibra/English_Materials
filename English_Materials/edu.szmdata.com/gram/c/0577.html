<p class="subTitle">3.203 Talking about two actions done by different people: phase verbs separated by an object</p>
<p>If you want to talk about two closely linked actions which are performed by different people, you follow the first verb with an object. This object then functions as the subject of the second verb. For example, in 'She asked Ginny to collect the book', 'Ginny' is the person who is asked, and she is also the person who performs the action of collecting the book.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>I</i> <b>saw him looking</b> <i>at my name on the door</i>.</li>
	<li><i>She knew her father wouldn't dare to</i> <b>stop her associating</b> <i>with her friends</i>.</li>
	<li><i>They</i> <b>left her to lie</b> <i>on the wooden floor</i>.</li>
	<li><i>The committee's lawyers</i> <b>had advised certain people to stay</b> <i>away</i>.</li>
</ul>
