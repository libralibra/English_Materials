<p class="subTitle">8.112 Nominal relative clauses</p>
<p>When it is difficult to refer to something by using a noun group, you can sometimes use a special kind of relative clause called a <b>nominal relative clause</b>.</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>What he really needs</b> <i>is a nice cup of tea</i>.</li>
	<li><b>Whatever she does</b> <i>will determine the future of her administration</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p class="clgm_hw">8.113</p>
<p>Nominal relative clauses beginning with 'what' can be used as subjects, objects, or complements. 'What' can mean either 'the thing which' or 'the things which'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>What he said</b> <i>was perfectly true</i>.</li>
	<li><i>They did not like</i> <b>what he wrote</b>.</li>
	<li><i>I believe that is a very good account of</i> <b>what happened</b>.</li>
	<li><i>I'm</i> <b>what's generally called a traitor</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>People often use a 'what'-clause in front of 'is' or 'was' to say what kind of thing they are about to mention.</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>What I need</b> <i>is a lawyer</i>.</li>
	<li><b>What you have to do</b> <i>is to choose five companies to invest in</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>These structures are explained in paragraphs <b>10.28 to 10.30</b>.</p>
<p>For another use of 'what' in nominal relative clauses see paragraph <b>8.116</b>.</p>
<p class="clgm_hw">8.114</p>
<p>Nominal relative clauses beginning with 'where' are usually used after a preposition or after the verb 'be'. 'Where' means 'the place where'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>I threw down my book and crossed the room to</i> <b>where she was sitting</b>.</li>
	<li><i>The god would return from</i> <b>where the sun rises</b> <i>and lay waste to the Aztec civilisation</i>.</li>
	<li><i>Stroud, I think, is</i> <b>where I want to die</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p class="clgm_hw">8.115</p>
<p>Nominal relative clauses beginning with 'whatever', 'whoever', or 'whichever' are used to refer to something or someone that is unknown or indefinite.</p>
<p>'Whatever' is used only to refer to things. 'Whoever' is used to refer to people. 'Whichever' is used to refer to either things or people.</p>
<p>'Whatever', 'whoever', and 'whichever' can be used as pronouns. 'Whichever' is often followed by 'of'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>I'll do</i> <b>whatever you want</b>.</li>
	<li><i>These wild flowers are so rare I want to do</i> <b>whatever I can</b> <i>to save them</i>.</li>
	<li><i>...a person with written authority from</i> <b>whoever is dealing with the will</b>.</li>
	<li><i>People will choose</i> <b>whichever of these regimes they find suits them best</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>'Whatever' and 'whichever' can also be used as determiners.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>She had had to rely on</i> <b>whatever books were lying around there</b>.</li>
	<li><i>Choose</i> <b>whichever one of the three methods you fancy</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>For more information about 'whatever', 'whoever', and 'whichever' see paragraph <b>8.42</b>.</p>
<p class="clgm_hw">8.116</p>
<p>'What' can be used with the same meaning as 'whatever', both as a pronoun and a determiner.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>Do</i> <b>what you like</b>.</li>
	<li><i>People survived by sharing out</i> <b>what money they could get from cattle-work</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The main use of 'what' in nominal relative clauses is explained in paragraph <b>8.113</b>.</p>
