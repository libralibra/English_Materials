<p class="subTitle">1.78 Referring to activities and processes: '-ing' nouns</p>
<p>You often want to refer to an action, activity, or process in a general way. When you do, you can use a noun which has the same form as the <b>present participle</b> of a verb.</p>
<p>These nouns are called different things in different grammars: <b>gerunds</b>, <b>verbal nouns</b>, or <b>-ing forms</b>. In this grammar we call them <b>'-ing' nouns</b>.</p>
<p>It is sometimes difficult to distinguish an <b>'-ing' noun</b> from a <b>present participle</b>, and it is usually not necessary to do so. However, there are times when it is clearly a noun, for example when it is the subject of a verb, the object of a verb, or the object of a preposition.</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Singing</b><i>'s one of my interests --- I belong to a choir</i>.</li>
	<li><i>They were at school when the emphasis was on</i> <b>teaching</b> <i>rather than</i> <b>learning</b>.</li>
	<li><i>He told how hard the days of</i> <b>walking</b> <i>had been, how his muscles had ached</i>.</li>
	<li><i>The</i> <b>coming</b> <i>of the transistor could not have been foreseen</i>.</li>
	<li><i>Some people have never actually done any</i> <b>computing</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The use of <b>'-ing' adjectives</b> is explained in paragraphs <b>2.67 to 2.80</b>.</p>
