<p class="subTitle">1.177 'the' with uncount nouns</p>
<p>You do not normally use 'the' with <b>uncount nouns</b> because they refer to something in a general way. However, 'the' is required if the uncount noun is followed by a qualifier which relates it to a particular person, thing, or group.</p>
<p>For example, you cannot say 'I am interested in education of young children'. You have to say 'I am interested in the education of young children'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>Babies need</i> <b>the comfort of their mother's arms</b>.</li>
	<li><i>Even</i> <b>the honesty of Inspector Butler</b> <i>was in doubt</i>.</li>
	<li><i>I've no idea about</i> <b>the geography of Scotland</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>For more information about uncount nouns, see paragraphs <b>1.24 to 1.34</b>.</p>
