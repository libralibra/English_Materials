<p class="subTitle">3.27 PRODUCTIVE FEATURE</p>
<p>If an action usually involves two different people but you want to talk about a case where the same person is involved twice, you can use a <b>reflexive pronoun</b> as the object of a clause. For example, it is usual to blame someone else if something goes wrong, but you can say 'I blame myself for what happened' if you are the only person involved in the blaming.</p>
<p>Although a few verbs are typically used with reflexive pronouns, you can actually use a reflexive pronoun as the object of any transitive verb, when the meaning allows you to do so.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>I</i> <b>blame myself</b> <i>for not paying attention</i>.</li>
	<li><i>She</i> <b>freed herself</b> <i>from my embrace</i>.</li>
	<li><i>After the meeting, he</i> <b>introduced himself</b> <i>to me</i>.</li>
	<li><i>I had decided</i> <b>to kill myself</b>.</li>
	<li><b>Don't deceive yourself</b>.</li>
	<li><i>We Americans</i> <b>must ask ourselves</b> <i>several questions</i>.</li>
	<li><i>The insect, in effect</i>, <b>is eating itself</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a <b>productive feature</b> of English. Productive features are explained in the Introduction.</p>
<p><b>Reflexive pronouns</b> are explained in paragraphs <b>1.115 to 1.122</b>.</p>
