<p class="subTitle">10.106 Exclamations</p>
<p><b>Exclamations</b> are words and structures that express something emphatically. You usually show this in speech by your intonation and in writing by the use of an <b>exclamation mark</b> at the end of the sentence, although full stops are often used instead. If the exclamation is only a part of a sentence, it is separated from the rest of the sentence by a comma.</p>
