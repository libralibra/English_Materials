<p class="subTitle">8.140 omitting words in the second clause</p>
<p>When you link clauses which have the same subject, you do not always need to repeat the subject in the second clause.</p>
<p>If the conjunction is 'and', 'or', or 'then', you do not usually repeat the subject.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>He took her hands from her eyes</i> <b>and led her towards the house</b>.</li>
	<li><i>It's a long time since you've bought them a drink</i> <b>or talked to them</b>.</li>
	<li><i>When she recognized Morris she went pale</i>, <b>then blushed</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the conjunction is 'but', 'so', or 'yet', it is usual to repeat the subject.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>I try and see it their way</i>, <b>but I can't</b>.</li>
	<li><i>I had no car</i>, <b>so I hired one for the journey</b>.</li>
	<li><i>He lost the fight</i>, <b>yet somehow he emerged with his dignity enhanced</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>When you link clauses which have different subjects but which have some common elements, you do not need to repeat all the elements in the second clause.</p>
<p>For example, instead of saying 'Some of them went to one pub and some of them went to the other pub', you can say 'Some of them went to one pub and some to the other'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>One soldier was killed</i> <b>and another wounded</b>.</li>
	<li><i>One of its sides was painted black</i> <b>and the other white</b>.</li>
</ul>
