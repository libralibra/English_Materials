<p class="subTitle">5.90 'at' for specific times</p>
<p>If you want to say when something happens, you use 'at' with clock times, periods of the year, and periods of the day except for 'morning', 'evening', 'afternoon', and 'daytime'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>Our train went</i> <b>at 2.25</b>.</li>
	<li><i>It's on Radio Four</i> <b>at ten to eight</b> <i>tomorrow evening</i>.</li>
	<li><i>We were in Dunfermline</i> <b>at twenty five past</b>.</li>
	<li><i>You should go to church</i> <b>at Easter</b> <i>and</i> <b>Christmas</b>.</li>
	<li><i>I went down and fetched her back</i> <b>at the weekend</b>.</li>
	<li><i>On Tuesday evening, just</i> <b>at dusk</b>, <i>Brody had received an anonymous phone call</i>.</li>
	<li><i>He regarded it as his duty to come and read to me</i> <b>at bedtime</b>.</li>
	<li><b>At night</b> <i>we kept them shut up in a wire enclosure</i>.</li>
	<li><i>Let the fire burn out now. Who would see smoke</i> <b>at night-time</b> <i>anyway?</i></li>
</ul>
<p>You can also use 'at' with 'time' and similar words such as 'moment' and 'juncture' and with units of clock time such as 'hour' and 'minute'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>General de Gaulle duly attended the military ceremony</i> <b>at the appointed time</b>.</li>
	<li><i>It was</i> <b>at this juncture</b> <i>that his luck temporarily deserted him</i>.</li>
	<li><i>If I could have done it</i> <b>at that minute</b> <i>I would have killed him</i>.</li>
	<li><i>There were no lights</i> <b>at this hour</b>, <i>and roads, bungalows and gardens lay quiet</i>.</li>
</ul>
