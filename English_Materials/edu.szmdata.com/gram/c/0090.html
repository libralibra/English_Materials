<p>You refer to the person or people you are talking to as 'you'. Note that the same word is used for the singular and the plural.</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>You</b> <i>may have to wait a bit</i>.</li>
	<li><i>Would</i> <b>you</b> <i>come and have a drink?</i></li>
	<li><i>How did</i> <b>you</b> <i>get on?</i></li>
