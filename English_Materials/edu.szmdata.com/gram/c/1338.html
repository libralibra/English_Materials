<p class="subTitle">10.68 specification</p>
<p>When you are making it clear what aspect of something you are talking about, you use sentence adverbs formed from classifying adjectives. For example, if you want to say that something is important in the field of politics or from a political point of view, you can say that it is 'politically important'. These adverbs often come in front of an adjective, or at the beginning or end of a clause.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>It would have been</i> <b>politically</b> <i>damaging for him to retreat</i>.</li>
	<li><b>Technically</b>, <i>marriage has a legally enshrined status</i>.</li>
	<li><i>We had a very bad year last year</i> <b>financially</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following is a list of adverbs that can refer to a particular aspect of something:</p>
<ul>
	<li class="c_list"><b>aesthetically, biologically, chemically, commercially, culturally, ecologically, economically, emotionally, environmentally, ethically, financially, geographically, ideologically, intellectually, logically, mechanically, mentally, morally, numerically, outwardly, physically, politically, psychologically, racially, scientifically, sexually, socially, spiritually, statistically, superficially, technically, technologically, visually</b></li>
</ul>
