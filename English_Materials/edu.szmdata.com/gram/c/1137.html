<p class="subTitle">8.83 Relative clauses</p>
<p>When you mention someone or something in a sentence, you often want to give further information about them. One way to do this is to use a <b>relative clause</b>.</p>
<p>You put a relative clause immediately after the noun which refers to the person, thing, or group you are talking about.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>The man</i> <b>who came into the room</b> <i>was small and slender</i>.</li>
	<li><i>Opposite is St. Paul's Church</i>, <b>where you can hear some lovely music</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Relative clauses have a similar function to adjectives, and they are sometimes called <b>adjectival clauses</b>.</p>
<p><b>Nominal relative clauses</b>, which have a similar function to noun groups, are explained in paragraphs <b>8.112 to 8.116</b>.</p>
