<p class="subTitle">8.2 conjunctions</p>
<p>When you put two clauses into one sentence, you use a <b>conjunction</b>to link them and to indicate the relationship between them.</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>When</b> <i>he stopped, no one said anything</i>.</li>
	<li><i>They were going by car</i> <b>because</b> <i>it was more comfortable</i>.</li>
	<li><i>The telephone rang</i> <b>and</b> <i>Judy picked it up</i>.</li>
	<li><i>Manfred behaved perfectly</i>, <b>but</b> <i>Gertrude had little idea of what he was thinking</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p class="clgm_hw">8.3</p>
