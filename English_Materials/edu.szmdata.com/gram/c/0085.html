<p class="subTitle">1.94 Referring to people and things without naming them: pronouns</p>
<p>When we use language, both in speech and writing, we constantly refer to things we have already mentioned or are about to mention.</p>
<p>We can do this by repeating the noun group, but unless there is a special reason to do so we are more likely to use a <b>pronoun</b> instead.</p>
<p>Pronouns make statements less repetitive while showing how the subjects and objects of a clause or a series of clauses are connected.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>John took the book and opened</i> <b>it</b>.</li>
	<li><i>Deborah recognized the knife as</i> <b>hers</b>.</li>
	<li><i>Shilton was pleased with</i> <b>himself</b>.</li>
	<li><b>This</b> <i>is a very busy place</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, if you have mentioned two or more different things, you usually have to repeat the noun group to make it clear which thing you are now talking about.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>Leaflets and scraps of papers were scattered all over the floor</i>. <i>I started to pick up</i> <b>the leaflets</b>.</li>
	<li><i>I could see a lorry and a car</i>. <b>The lorry</b> <i>stopped</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>For other ways of talking about things that have already been mentioned, see the section on <b>cohesion</b> at paragraphs <b>9.2 to 9.40</b>.</p>
