<p class="subTitle">2.179 PRODUCTIVE FEATURE</p>
<p>The use of noun modifiers in English is very common indeed. In fact, when the context makes it clear what you mean, you can use almost any noun to modify any other noun. You can use noun modifiers to indicate a wide range of relationships between the two nouns.</p>
<p>For example, you can say what something is made of, as in 'cotton socks'. You can also say what is made in a particular place, as in 'a glass factory'. You can say what someone does, as in 'a football player', or you can say where something is, as in 'my bedroom curtains'.</p>
<p>You can say when something happens, as in 'the morning mist' and 'her wartime activities'. You can also describe the nature or size of something, as in 'a surprise attack' and 'a pocket chess-set'.</p>
<p>The use of noun modifiers is a <b>productive feature</b> of English. Productive features are explained in the Introduction.</p>
