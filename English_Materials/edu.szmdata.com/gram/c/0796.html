<p class="subTitle">4.239 giving instructions and making requests</p>
<p>Instead of beginning a question with 'can' or 'could' when you are making a request, you can begin it with 'is' and the impersonal pronoun 'it'. After 'it', you put an expression such as 'all right' and either a 'to'-infinitive clause or an 'if'-clause.</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Is it</b> <i>all right for him to come in and sit and read his paper?</i></li>
	<li><b>Is it</b> <i>okay if we have lunch here?</i></li>
</ul>
<p class="clgm_hw">4.240</p>
<p>You can use 'want' instead of 'would like' to give an instruction or make a request. 'Want' is more direct and less polite than 'would like'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>I</i> <b>want</b> <i>you to turn to the front of the atlas</i>.</li>
	<li><i>I</i> <b>want</b> <i>to know what you think about this</i>.</li>
	<li><i>I</i> <b>want</b> <i>to have this pellet taken out</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>'Wanted' is also sometimes used. It is more polite than 'want'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>I</i> <b>wanted</b> <i>to ask, Mr Nicholson, what was the effect of that newsreel on you?</i></li>
	<li><i>Good morning, I</i> <b>wanted</b> <i>to book a holiday in the South of France</i>.</li>
</ul>
