<p class="subTitle">7.87 saying what someone knows</p>
<p>If you want to say that someone knows something, you can say what they know in a 'that'-clause after an adjective such as 'aware' or 'conscious'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>He was aware</i> <b>that he had drunk too much whisky</b>.</li>
	<li><i>I am conscious</i> <b>that I have provided no answer in this book</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is a list of adjectives indicating knowledge:</p>
<ul>
	<li class="c_list"><b>aware, certain, conscious, convinced, positive, sure, unaware</b></li>
</ul>
<p>'Aware' is occasionally used with a reported clause beginning with a 'wh'-word.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>I am well aware</i> <b>how busy you are at this season of the year</b>.</li>
</ul>
