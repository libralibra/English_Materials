<p class="subTitle">6.89 adverbs of position: comparatives and superlatives</p>
<p>Some adverbs have comparative and superlative forms. The superlative form is not used to indicate position, but to specify which of several things you are talking about.</p>
<p>'Deeper', 'farther' (or 'further'), 'higher', and 'lower' are usually followed by another adjunct of position.</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Further</b> <b>along the beach</b>, <i>a thin trickle of smoke was climbing into the sky</i>.</li>
	<li><i>The beans are a bit</i> <b>higher</b> <b>on the stalk</b> <i>this year</i>.</li>
	<li><b>Higher</b> <b>up</b>, <b>on the backrest</b>, <i>there was an oval stain</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>'Nearer' can be used as an adverb as well as a preposition (see paragraph <b>6.68</b> above). 'Closer' can only be used as an adverb.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>The hills were</i> <b>nearer</b> <i>now</i>.</li>
	<li><i>Thousands of tourists stood watching or milled around trying to get</i> <b>closer</b>.</li>
</ul>
