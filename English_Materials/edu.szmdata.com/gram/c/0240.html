<p class="subTitle">2.57 adjectives followed by 'that'-clauses</p>
<p>When adjectives which refer to someone's beliefs or feelings are used predicatively, they are often followed by a <b>'that'-clause</b> (see paragraphs <b>7.85 to 7.87</b>). The subject of the 'that'-clause is not always the same as the subject of the main clause, and so you need to specify it.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>She was</i> <b>sure that</b> <i>he meant it</i>.</li>
	<li><i>He was</i> <b>frightened that</b> <i>something terrible might be said</i>.</li>
	<li><i>I'm</i> <b>aware that</b> <i>I reached a rather large audience through the book</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that the word 'that' is not always used in a 'that'-clause.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>They were</i> <b>sure</b> <i>she had been born in the city</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is a list of common adjectives often followed by a 'that'-clause:</p>
<ul>
	<li class="c_list"><b>afraid, angry, anxious, aware, careful, certain, frightened, glad, happy, pleased, proud, sad, sorry, sure, surprised, unaware, upset, worried</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Note that all of these adjectives except 'angry', 'aware', 'unaware', 'upset', and 'worried' can also be followed by a 'to'-infinitive clause.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>I was</i> <b>afraid that she might not be able to bear the strain</b>.</li>
	<li><i>Don't be</i> <b>afraid to ask questions</b>.</li>
	<li><i>She was</i> <b>surprised that I knew about it</b>.</li>
	<li><i>The twins were very</i> <b>surprised to see Ralph</b>.</li>
</ul>
