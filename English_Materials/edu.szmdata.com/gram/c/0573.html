<p class="subTitle">3.198 WARNING</p>
<p>Note that when you have a choice between a present participle and a 'to'-infinitive, you do not use the present participle if the first verb is in a continuous tense.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>The Third World</i> <b>is beginning to export</b> <i>to the West</i>.</li>
	<li><i>The big clouds</i> <b>were starting to cover</b> <i>the sun</i>.</li>
	<li><i>Educational budgets</i> <b>are continuing to increase</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>With verbs that cannot be followed by a 'to'-infinitive, we would normally use a noun group instead of the present participle.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>I knew Miss Head would just be finishing</i> <b>her cello practice</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p class="clgm_hw">3.199</p>
<p>Note that a few verbs, principally 'need', 'want', 'have', 'buy', and 'choose', are used with an object and a 'to'-infinitive when talking about two actions performed by the same person. The 'to'-infinitive must be transitive. It is understood as qualifying the noun, rather than being closely connected with the first verb.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>I</i> <b>wanted some goods to place</b> <i>in the window</i>.</li>
	<li><i>She</i> <b>chose the correct one to put</b> <i>in her bag</i>.</li>
</ul>
