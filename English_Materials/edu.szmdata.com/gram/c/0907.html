<p class="subTitle">5.116 estimating frequency</p>
<p>If you want to be less precise about how frequently something happens, you can use one of the following approximating adverbs or approximating expressions: 'almost', about', 'nearly' 'or so', 'or less', and 'or more'.</p>
<p>You can use 'almost' and 'about' in front of 'every':</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>In the last month of her pregnancy, we took to going out</i> <b>almost</b> <i>every evening</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also use 'almost' in front of '-ly' time adverbs derived from general time words:</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>Small scale confrontations occur</i> <b>almost</b> <i>daily in many states</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>'Or so', 'or less', and 'or more', are used after frequency expressions, but not after adverbs of frequency.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>Every hour</i> <b>or so</b>, <i>my shoulders would tighten</i>.</li>
	<li><i>If you are studying part-time (21 hours</i> <b>or less</b> <i>a week) you can claim supplementary benefit</i>.</li>
</ul>
