<p class="subTitle">10.72 PRODUCTIVE FEATURE</p>
<p>Another way of saying something like 'with regard to money' is 'money-wise'. You add the suffix '-wise' to a noun referring to the aspect you mean. This is generally used to avoid the creation of long phrases.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>Not to have visited the company's plant in Frankfurt or the American subsidiary will put you at a disadvantage</i> <b>status-wise</b>.</li>
	<li><i>We are mostly Socialists</i> <b>vote-wise</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a productive feature in American English, but is not so common in British English. Productive features are explained in the Introduction.</p>
