<p class="subTitle">10.62 indicating your justification for a statement</p>
<p>If you are basing your statement on something that you have seen, heard, or read, you can use a sentence adverb to indicate this. For example, if you can see that an object has been made by hand, you might say 'It is obviously made by hand.'</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>His friend was</i> <b>obviously</b> <i>impressed</i>.</li>
	<li><i>Higgins</i> <b>evidently</b> <i>knew nothing about their efforts</i>.</li>
	<li><b>Apparently</b> <i>they had a row</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are some common adverbs used in this way:</p>
<p><b>apparently, clearly, evidently, manifestly, obviously, plainly, unmistakably, visibly</b></p>
