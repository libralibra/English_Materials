<p class="subTitle">8.111 commenting on a time or situation</p>
<p>When you want to add something to what you have said, you sometimes use a non-defining clause beginning with a preposition, 'which', and a noun. The noun is often a word like 'time' or 'point', or a very general word for a situation like 'case' or 'event'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>They remain in the pouch for some seven weeks</i> <b>by which time</b> <i>they are about 10cm long</i>.</li>
	<li><i>I was told my work was unsatisfactory</i>, <b>at which point</b> <i>I submitted my resignation</i>.</li>
	<li><i>Sometimes you may feel too frail too cope with things</i>, <b>in which case</b> <i>do them as soon as it is convenient</i>.</li>
</ul>
