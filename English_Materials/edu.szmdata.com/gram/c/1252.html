<p class="subTitle">9.35 'the same'</p>
<p>'Same' can also be the complement of a link verb when you want to indicate that something is similar in every way to something that has just been mentioned. When 'same' is used after a link verb it always follows 'the'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>The Queen treated us very well. The Princess Royal was just</i> <b>the same</b>.</li>
	<li><i>My brothers and myself were very poor, but so happy. I think other families were</i> <b>the same</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p class="clgm_hw">9.36</p>
<p>You can also use 'the same' without a following noun as the subject or object of a clause, to refer back to something that has just been mentioned.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>The conversion process is inefficient and about two-thirds of the energy is wasted</i>. <b>The same</b> <i>is true of nuclear power stations</i>.</li>
	<li><i>'I've never heard of him.' --- 'I wish I could say</i> <b>the same.'</b></li>
</ul>
<p>'The same thing' can be used exactly like 'the same', as a subject or object.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>He was stopped and sent back to get a ticket. On the return journey</i> <b>the same thing</b> <i>happened</i>.</li>
	<li><i>I learnt how to kill people with my bare hands. And I'm not proud of the fact that I taught a number of other people to do</i> <b>the same thing</b>.</li>
</ul>
