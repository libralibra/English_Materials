<p class="subTitle">1.118 WARNING</p>
<p>Reflexive pronouns are not usually used with actions that people normally do to themselves, such as washing, dressing, or shaving. So you do not usually say 'He shaves himself every morning'.</p>
<p>You can, however, sometimes use reflexive pronouns with these actions for emphasis, or to indicate a surprising event, such as a child or invalid doing something that they were not previously able to do.</p>
