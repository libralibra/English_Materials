<p class="subTitle">10.57 indicating your opinion</p>
<p>One group of sentence adjuncts is used to indicate your reaction to, or your opinion of, the fact or event you are talking about.</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Surprisingly</b>, <i>most of my help came from the technicians</i>.</li>
	<li><b>Luckily</b>, <i>I had seen the play before so I knew what it was about</i>.</li>
	<li><i>It is</i> <b>fortunately</b> <i>not a bad bump, and Henry is only slightly hurt</i>.</li>
	<li><b>Interestingly</b>, <i>the solution adopted in these two countries was the same</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following adjuncts are commonly used in this way:</p>
<ul>
	<li class="c_list"><b>absurdly, admittedly, alas, anyway, astonishingly, at least, characteristically, coincidentally, conveniently, curiously, fortunately, happily, incredibly, interestingly, ironically, luckily, mercifully, miraculously, mysteriously, naturally, oddly, of course, paradoxically, please, predictably, remarkably, sadly, significantly, strangely, surprisingly, true, typically, unbelievably, understandably, unexpectedly, unfortunately, unhappily, unnecessarily</b></li>
</ul>
<p>One of the uses of 'at least' and 'anyway' is to indicate that you are pleased about the fact you are giving, although there may be other less desirable facts.</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>At least</b> <i>we're agreed on something</i>.</li>
	<li><i>He fell back with a look of surprise --- dead. It's quick</i>, <b>anyway</b>, <i>I thought</i>.</li>
</ul>
