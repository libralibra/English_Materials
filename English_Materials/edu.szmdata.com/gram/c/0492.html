<p class="subTitle">3.84 Extending or changing the meaning of a verb: phrasal verbs</p>
<p>There is a special group of verbs which consist of two or three words. These are called <b>phrasal verbs</b>. They consist of</p>
<p>*  a verb followed by an adverb:</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>He</i> <b>sat down</b>.</li>
	<li><i>Ralph stood on his head and</i> <b>fell over</b>.</li>
	<li><i>The cold weather</i> <b>set in</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>*  a verb followed by a preposition:</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>She</i> <b>looked after</b> <i>her invalid mother</i>.</li>
	<li><i>She</i> <b>sailed through</b> <i>her exams</i>.</li>
	<li><i>The other day I</i> <b>came across</b> <i>a letter from Brunel written in the last year of his life</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>*  or a verb followed by an adverb and a preposition.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>You may</i> <b>come up against</b> <i>unexpected difficulties</i>.</li>
	<li><i>I</i> <b>look forward to</b> <i>reading it</i>.</li>
	<li><i>Fame has</i> <b>crept up on</b> <i>her almost by accident</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>By combining a verb and an adverb or preposition in this way, we can extend the usual meaning of the verb or create a new meaning, different from any that the verb has on its own. You cannot, therefore, always guess the meaning of a phrasal verb from the usual meanings of the verb and the adverb or preposition.</p>
<p>In the case of a few phrasal verbs, the first part is not found independently as a verb. For example, there are phrasal verbs 'sum up', 'tamper with', and 'zero in on', but no verbs 'sum', 'tamper', or 'zero'.</p>
<p>Note that phrasal verbs are never written as a single word or with a hyphen.</p>
<p class="clgm_hw">3.85</p>
<p>Most phrasal verbs consist of two words. These are explained below in paragraphs <b>3.86 to 3.111</b>. Three-word phrasal verbs are explained in paragraphs <b>3.112 to 3.114</b>.</p>
