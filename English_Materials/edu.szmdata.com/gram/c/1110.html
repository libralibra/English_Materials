<p class="subTitle">8.28 tenses in conditional clauses</p>
<p>There are special rules about which tense to use in conditional sentences.</p>
<p>Foreign learners are often taught that there are three kinds of conditional sentence:</p>
<p>*  the <b>first conditional</b>, in which the verb in the main clause is 'will' or 'shall' and the verb in the conditional clause is in the <b>simple present tense</b></p>
<p> *  the <b>second conditional</b>, in which the verb in the main clause is 'would' or 'should' and the verb in the conditional clause is in the <b>simple past tense</b></p>
<p> *  the <b>third conditional</b>, in which the verb in the main clause is 'would have' or 'should have' and the verb in the conditional clause is in the <b>past perfect tense</b>.</p>
<p>This is largely correct, but does not fully describe the normal patterns of tense in conditional clauses which are set out in the following paragraphs.</p>
