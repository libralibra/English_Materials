<p class="subTitle">3.155 commenting on an action</p>
<p>If you want to show your opinion of an action, you can use a transitive 'to'-infinitive clause after a complement.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>They thought this was</i> <b>a sensible thing to do</b>.</li>
	<li><i>This is</i> <b>a very foolish attitude to take</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The 'to'-infinitive is usually 'to do', 'to make', or 'to take'.</p>
<p>The complement must be a noun group consisting of 'a' or 'an', an adjective, and a noun. You cannot use an adjective in constructions of this kind. For example, you can say 'It was a silly thing to do', but you cannot say 'It was silly to do'.</p>
