<p class="subTitle">3.67 ergative verbs which need adjuncts</p>
<p>There are a small number of ergative verbs which usually have an adverb or other adjunct when they are used intransitively. This is because you choose this structure when you want to emphasize how something behaves when affected in some way, and so the person who does the action is not important.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>I like the new Range Rover. It</i> <b>handles beautifully</b>.</li>
	<li><i>Wool</i> <b>washes well</b> <i>if you treat it carefully</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is a list of ergative verbs which usually have an adjunct when they are used intransitively:</p>
<ul>
	<li class="c_list"><b>clean, handle, mark, polish, sell, stain, wash</b></li>
</ul>
