<p class="subTitle">7.36 reporting requests made to the hearer</p>
<p>If someone orders, requests, or advises someone else to do something, this can be reported by using a 'to'-infinitive clause after a reporting verb such as 'tell'. The person being addressed, who is to perform the action, is mentioned as the object of the reporting verb.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>Johnson told her to wake him up</i>.</li>
	<li><i>He commanded me to stay there</i>.</li>
	<li><i>He ordered me to fetch the books</i>.</li>
	<li><i>My doctor advised me to see a neurologist</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a type of <b>phase</b> structure (see paragraphs <b>3.203</b> and <b>3.207</b>).</p>
<p>Here is a list of reporting verbs which can be used with a person as object followed by a 'to'-infinitive clause:</p>
<ul>
	<li class="c_list"><b>advise, ask, beg, command, forbid, instruct, invite, order, persuade, remind, teach, tell, urge, warn</b></li>
</ul>
