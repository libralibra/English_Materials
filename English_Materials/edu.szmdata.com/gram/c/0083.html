<p class="subTitle">1.91 USAGE NOTE</p>
<p>In some cases, the meaning of a compound noun is not obvious from the words it consists of.</p>
<p>For example, someone's 'mother-tongue' is not the tongue of their mother but the language they learn as a child, and an 'old hand' is not a hand which is old but a person who is experienced at doing a particular job.</p>
<p>In other cases, the compound noun consists of words which do not occur on their own, for example 'hanky-panky', 'hodge-podge', and 'argy-bargy'. These nouns are usually used in informal conversation rather than formal writing.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>The rest of your question I find rhetorical</i> <b>hocus-pocus</b>.</li>
	<li><i>She is invariably up to some sort of</i> <b>jiggery-pokery</b>.</li>
</ul>
