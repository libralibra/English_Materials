<p class="subTitle">8.23 using non-finite clauses</p>
<p>Instead of using a finite time clause, you can often use a <b>non-finite clause</b>.</p>
<p>For example, you can say 'I often read a book when travelling by train', meaning 'I often read a book when I am travelling by train', and you can say 'When finished, the building will be opened by the Prince of Wales', meaning 'When it is finished, the building will be opened by the Prince of Wales'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>Adults sometimes do not realize their own strength</i> <b>when dealing with children</b>.</li>
	<li><i>Mark watched us</i> <b>while pretending not to</b>.</li>
	<li><i>I deliberately didn't read the book</i> <b>before going to see the film</b>.</li>
	<li><b>After evicting the inhabitants</b>, <i>he declared the houses derelict</i>.</li>
	<li><i>They had not spoken a word</i> <b>since leaving the party</b>.</li>
	<li><i>Michael used to look hurt and surprised</i> <b>when scolded</b>.</li>
	<li><b>Once convinced of the necessity of a move</b> <i>he worked with persistence and diplomacy until the college found a new home</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that you can only use a non-finite clause when it does not need to have a new subject, that is, when it is about the same thing as the main clause.</p>
