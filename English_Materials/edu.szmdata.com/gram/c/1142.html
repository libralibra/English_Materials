<p class="subTitle">8.88 non-finite clauses</p>
<p>Relative clauses can sometimes be reduced to <b>non-finite clauses</b>.</p>
<p>For example, instead of saying 'Give it to the man who is wearing the bowler hat', you can say 'Give it to the man wearing the bowler hat'. Similarly, instead of saying 'The bride, who was smiling happily, chatted to the guests', you can say 'The bride, smiling happily, chatted to the guests'.</p>
<p>These uses are explained in paragraphs <b>8.117 to 8.133</b>. See also paragraphs <b>2.317</b> and <b>2.318</b> in the section on <b>qualifiers</b>.</p>
