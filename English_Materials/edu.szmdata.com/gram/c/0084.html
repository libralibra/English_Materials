<p class="subTitle">1.92 plural forms</p>
<p>The plural forms of compound nouns vary according to the type of words that they consist of. If the final word of a compound noun is a count noun, the plural form of the count noun is used when the compound noun is plural.</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Air raids</b> <i>were taking place every night</i>.</li>
	<li><i></i>...<b>health centres</b>, <i>banks</i>, <b>post offices</b>, <i>and</i> <b>police stations</b>.</li>
	<li><i>Shrill voices would be heard through</i> <b>letter-boxes</b>.</li>
	<li><i>...the refusal of dockers to use</i> <b>fork-lift trucks</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Compound nouns that are directly related to phrasal verbs usually have a plural form ending in '-s'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>Nobody seems disturbed about</i> <b>cover-ups</b> <i>when they are essential to the conduct of a war</i>.</li>
	<li><i>Naturally, I think people who drive smarter, faster cars than mine are a bunch of low-grade</i> <b>show-offs</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>A few compound nouns are less directly related to phrasal verbs, and consist of a count noun and an adverb. In these cases, the plural form of the count noun is used before the adverb when the compound noun is plural.</p>
<p>For example, the plural of 'looker-on' is 'lookers-on', and the plural of 'summing-up' is 'summings-up'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>He stopped</i> <b>passers-by</b> <i>and offered it for sale</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Compound nouns which consist of two nouns linked by the prepositions 'of' or 'in', or a noun followed by 'to-be', have a plural form in which the first noun in the compound is plural.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>I like</i> <b>birds of prey</b> <i>and hawks particularly</i>.</li>
	<li><i>...brothers whom I had considered my</i> <b>comrades in arms</b>.</li>
	<li><i>The veil places</i> <b>brides-to-be</b> <i>at a distinct advantage</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some compound nouns have been borrowed from other languages, mainly French and Latin, and therefore do not have normal English plural forms.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>...aided by</i> <b>agents provocateurs</b> <i>sent into our midst</i>.</li>
	<li><i>...while the</i> <b>nouveaux riches</b> <i>of younger states built themselves palatial mansions</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p class="clgm_hw">1.93</p>
<p>Compound nouns are fixed expressions. However, nouns can always be used in front of other nouns in order to refer to something in a more specific way. For the use of nouns as <b>modifiers</b>, see paragraphs <b>2.174 to 2.179</b>.</p>
