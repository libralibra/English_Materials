<p class="subTitle">6.51 submodifiers</p>
<p>You can use some adverbs of degree in front of other adverbs. When adverbs of degree are used like this they are called <b>submodifiers</b>.</p>
<p>They can also be used as submodifiers in front of adjectives; this use is explained in paragraphs <b>2.145 to 2.173</b>, where lists of submodifiers and their meanings are also given.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>He prepared his speech</i> <b>very</b> <i>carefully</i>.</li>
	<li><i>He was having to work</i> <b>awfully</b> <i>hard</i>.</li>
	<li><i>Things changed</i> <b>really</b> <i>dramatically</i>.</li>
	<li><i>We get on</i> <b>extremely</b> <i>well with our neighbours</i>.</li>
	<li><i>We were able to hear everything</i> <b>pretty</b> <i>clearly</i>.</li>
	<li><i>The paper disintegrated</i> <b>fairly</b> <i>easily</i>.</li>
	<li><i>He dressed</i> <b>rather</b> <i>formally</i>.</li>
	<li><i>Every child reacts</i> <b>somewhat</b> <i>differently</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that 'moderately' and 'reasonably' are mainly used in front of adverbs which do not end in '-ly'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>He works</i> <b>reasonably</b> <i>hard</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>A few adverbs of degree can be used as submodifiers with comparatives: see the section beginning at paragraph <b>2.162</b>.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>This could all be done</i> <b>very much more quickly</b>.</li>
	<li><i>I thanked him again</i>, <b>even more profusely</b> <i>than before</i>.</li>
	<li><i>I hope you can see</i> <b>slightly more clearly</b> <i>what is going on</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that 'still' can also be placed after the comparative.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>They're doing better in some respects now. Of course they've got to do</i> <b>better still</b>.</li>
</ul>
