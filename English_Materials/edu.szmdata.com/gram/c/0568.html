<p class="subTitle">3.192 USAGE NOTE</p>
<p>Note that 'need' can be used with a present participle after it, but the present participle then has the same meaning as a passive 'to'-infinitive. For example, 'The house needs cleaning' means the same as 'The house needs to be cleaned'.</p>
<p>'Require' and 'want' are also occasionally used in the same way, although some speakers consider this use of 'want' to be incorrect.</p>
