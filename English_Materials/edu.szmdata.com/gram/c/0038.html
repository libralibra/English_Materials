<p class="subTitle">1.40 singular noun structures</p>
<p>There are two special kinds of structure in which a singular noun is used.</p>
<p>A singular noun is sometimes used with the determiner 'a' as the <b>complement</b> of a clause. See paragraphs <b>3.127 to 3.182</b> for more information about complements.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>Decision-making is</i> <b>an art</b>.</li>
	<li><i>The quickest way was by using the car. It was</i> <b>a risk</b> <i>but he decided it had to be taken</i>.</li>
	<li><i>They were beginning to find Griffiths' visits rather</i> <b>a strain</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>A singular noun is sometimes used with the determiner 'the', followed by a prepositional phrase beginning with 'of'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>Cultivate</i> <b>the art of</b> <i>reading upside down</i>.</li>
	<li><i>Old diesel locomotives will be replaced by newer ones to reduce</i> <b>the risk of</b> <i>breakdown</i>.</li>
	<li><i>He collapsed under</i> <b>the strain of</b> <i>a heavy workload</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>This group includes nouns used metaphorically; see paragraph <b>1.65</b> for more details.</p>
<p>Some singular nouns are always used to refer to one particular quality or thing, but are rarely used alone, that is they need to be specified in some way by the use of supporting material. They can be used with a number of different determiners.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>There was</i> <b>a note of satisfaction</b> <i>in his voice</i>.</li>
	<li><i>Bessie covered the last fifty yards at</i> <b>a tremendous pace</b>.</li>
	<li><i>Simon allowed</i> <b>his pace</b> <i>to slacken</i>.</li>
	<li><i>She was simply incapable of behaving in</i> <b>a rational and considered manner</b>.</li>
	<li><i></i>...<b>their manner</b> <i>of rearing their young</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Nouns which are rarely used alone without supporting material are discussed in detail in paragraphs <b>1.60 to 1.66</b>.</p>
