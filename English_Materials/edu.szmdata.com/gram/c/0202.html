<p class="subTitle">1.234 using 'one'</p>
<p>You use 'one' as a determiner when you have been talking or writing about a group of people or things and you want to say something about a particular member of the group. 'One' is used instead of 'a' or 'an' and is slightly more emphatic.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>We had</i> <b>one</b> <i>case which dragged on for a couple of years</i>.</li>
	<li><i>'They criticise me all the time,' wrote</i> <b>one</b> <i>divorced woman</i>.</li>
	<li><i>I know</i> <b>one</b> <i>household where that happened, actually</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The use of 'one' as a <b>number</b> is explained in paragraphs <b>2.230 to 2.232</b>.</p>
<p class="clgm_hw">1.235</p>
<p>Many determiners are also <b>pronouns</b>, that is they can be used without a following noun. For more information about these, see paragraphs <b>1.153 to 1.160</b>.</p>
