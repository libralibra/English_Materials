<p class="subTitle">4.60 'never'</p>
<p>'Never' is used to say that something was not or will not ever be the case.</p>
<p>When it is used with a verb group which contains an auxiliary verb, 'never' is put after the first verb in the verb group and in front of the main verb.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>I</i> <b>would never trust</b> <i>my judgement again</i>.</li>
	<li><i>...a type of glass which is rare and</i> <b>is never used</b>.</li>
	<li><i>The number of people who died</i> <b>will never be known</b>.</li>
	<li><i>Thirty years ago, the man</i> <b>was never expected to wash</b> <i>the dishes or help with the children</i>.</li>
	<li><i>I</i> <b>had never been</b> <i>to this big town before</i>.</li>
	<li><i>I</i><b>'ve never done</b> <i>so much work in all my life</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, you can put 'never' in front of the first word in the verb group in order to emphasize the negative aspect of a statement.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>I</i> <b>never would have guessed</b> <i>if he hadn't told me</i>.</li>
	<li><i>There was no such person --- there</i> <b>never had been</b>.</li>
</ul>
