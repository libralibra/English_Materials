<p class="subTitle">2.253 as pronouns</p>
<p>You can use an ordinal to refer to a member of a group that you have already mentioned or to something of the kind already mentioned, and you can omit the noun which identifies the thing.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>In August 1932 two of the group's members were expelled from the party and</i> <b>a third</b> <i>was suspended</i>.</li>
	<li><i>There is</i> <b>a third</b> <i>factor besides farming and herding in the spread of man-made desert: deforestation</i>.</li>
	<li><b>The third</b> <i>child tries to outdo</i> <b>the first and second</b>.</li>
	<li><i>A second pheasant flew up. Then</i> <b>a third</b> <i>and</i> <b>a fourth</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p class="clgm_hw">2.254</p>
<p>The adjectives 'next' and 'last' can be used, like ordinals, by themselves when the context makes the meaning clear.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>You missed one meal</i>. <b>The next</b> <i>is on the table in half an hour</i>.</li>
	<li><i>Smithy removed</i> <b>the last</b> <i>of the screws</i>.</li>
</ul>
