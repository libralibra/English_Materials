<p class="subTitle">1.228 'each' and 'every'</p>
<p>You use 'each' and 'every' when you are talking about all the members of a group of people or things. You use 'each' when you are thinking about the members as individuals, and 'every' when you are making a general statement about all of them. 'Each' and 'every' are followed by a singular count noun.</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Each seat</b> <i>was covered with a white lace cover</i>.</li>
	<li><i>They would rush out to meet</i> <b>each visitor</b>.</li>
	<li><i>This new wealth can be seen in</i> <b>every village</b>.</li>
	<li><b>Every child</b> <i>would have milk</i> <b>every day</b>.</li>
	<li><b>Each</b> <i>applicant has five choices</i>.</li>
	<li><i>I agree with</i> <b>every</b> <i>word Peter says</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can modify 'every' but not 'each'. You can say things such as 'Almost every chair is broken' or 'Not every chair is broken' but you cannot say 'Almost each chair is broken' or 'Not each chair is broken'. This is because 'each' is slightly more precise and definite than 'every'.</p>
<p>Note that 'each' can be used when talking about two people or things, but 'every' is only used for numbers larger than two.</p>
