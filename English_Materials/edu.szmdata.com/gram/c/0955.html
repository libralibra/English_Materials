<p class="subTitle">6.39 feelings and manner</p>
<p>Adverbs formed from adjectives which describe people's feelings, for example 'happily' or 'nervously', indicate both the way in which something is done and the feelings of the person who does it.</p>
<p>For example, the sentence 'She laughed happily' means both that she laughed in a happy way and that she was feeling happy.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>We laughed and chatted</i> <b>happily</b> <i>together</i>.</li>
	<li><i>Gaskell got up</i> <b>wearily</b> <i>and headed for the stairs</i>.</li>
	<li><i>They looked</i> <b>anxiously</b> <i>at each other</i>.</li>
	<li><i>Rudolph coughed</i> <b>miserably</b> <i>in the rain as he turned into Vanderhoff Street</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p class="clgm_hw">6.40</p>
<p>Here is a list of common adverbs which describe the feelings of the person who does something as well as the way in which it is done :</p>
<ul>
	<li class="c_list"><b>angrily, anxiously, bitterly, boldly, calmly, cheerfully, confidently, desperately, eagerly, excitedly, furiously, gladly, gloomily, gratefully, happily, helplessly, hopefully, hopelessly, impatiently, miserably, nervously, passionately, proudly, reluctantly, sadly, shyly, sincerely, uncomfortably, uneasily, unhappily, wearily</b></li>
