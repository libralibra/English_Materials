<p class="subTitle">8.157 USAGE NOTE</p>
<p>In informal speech, 'and' is often used between 'try' and another verb. For example, someone might say 'I'll try and get a newspaper'. However, this means the same as 'I'll try to get a newspaper', and it refers to one action, not two.</p>
<p>For more information about this use see paragraph <b>3.201</b>.</p>
<p class="clgm_hw">8.158</p>
<p>For information on how to coordinate more than two verbs, see paragraph <b>8.188</b>.</p>
