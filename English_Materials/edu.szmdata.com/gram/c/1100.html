<p class="subTitle">8.9 tenses in time clauses</p>
<p>When you are talking about the past or the present, the verb in a time clause has the same tense that it would have in a main clause or in a simple sentence.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>I was standing by the window when I</i> <b>heard</b> <i>her speak</i>.</li>
	<li><i>I haven't given him a thing to eat since he</i> <b>arrived</b>.</li>
	<li><i>I look after the children while she</i> <b>goes</b> <i>to London</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, if the time clause refers to something that will happen or exist in the future, you use the <b>simple present tense</b>, not a future tense.</p>
<p>For example, you say 'When he comes, I will show him the book', not 'When he will come, I will show him the book'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>As soon as we</i> <b>get</b> <i>the tickets, we'll send them to you</i>.</li>
	<li><i>He wants to see you before he</i> <b>dies</b>.</li>
	<li><i>Let me stay here till Jeannie</i> <b>comes</b> <i>to bed</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you mention an event in a time clause which will happen before an event referred to in the main clause, you use the <b>present perfect tense</b> in the time clause, not the future perfect tense.</p>
<p>For example, you say 'When you have had your supper, come and see me', not 'When you will have had your supper, come and see me'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>We won't be getting married until we'</i><b>ve saved</b> <i>enough money</i>.</li>
	<li><i>Tell the DHSS as soon as you</i> <b>have retired</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p class="clgm_hw">8.10</p>
<p>The most common conjunction in time clauses is 'when'. 'When' is used to say that something happened, happens, or will happen on a particular occasion.</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>When</b> <i>the telegram came and I read of his death, I couldn't believe it</i>.</li>
	<li><i>He didn't know how to behave</i> <b>when</b> <i>they next met</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p class="clgm_hw">8.11</p>
<p>You can mention the circumstances in which something happens or happened by using 'when', 'while', or 'as'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>The train has automatic doors that only open</i> <b>when</b> <i>the train is stationary</i>.</li>
	<li><b>While</b> <i>he was still in the stable, there was a loud knock at the front door</i>.</li>
	<li><i>He would swim beside me</i> <b>as</b> <i>I rowed in the little dinghy</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>'Whilst' is a more formal form of 'while'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>Two were mere lodgers whom we looked after</i> <b>whilst</b> <i>their mistress was away</i>.</li>
</ul>
