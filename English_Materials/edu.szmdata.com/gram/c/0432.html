<p class="subTitle">3.3 intransitive verbs</p>
<p>If an action or event involves only one person or thing, you mention only the performer of the action (the subject) and the action (the verb).</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>The girl screamed</i>.</li>
	<li><i>I waited</i>.</li>
	<li><i>An awful thing has happened</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Clauses of this kind are called <b>intransitive clauses</b>. Verbs which occur in intransitive clauses are called <b>intransitive verbs</b>.</p>
<p>However, you can then mention another person or thing which is involved using a <b>prepositional phrase</b>.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>She walked</i> <b>across the street</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Intransitive verbs are explained in paragraphs <b>3.9 to 3.14</b>.</p>
