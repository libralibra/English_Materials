<p class="subTitle">2.81 Special forms: '-ed' adjectives</p>
<p>A large number of English adjectives end in '-ed'. Many of them have the same form as the <b>past participle</b> of a verb. Others are formed by adding '-ed' to a noun. Others are not closely related to any other words.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>...a</i> <b>disappointed</b> <i>man</i>.</li>
	<li><i>...a</i> <b>bearded</b> <i>man</i>.</li>
	<li><i></i>...<b>sophisticated</b> <i>electronic devices</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p class="clgm_hw">2.82</p>
<p>Adjectives with the same form as irregular past participles which do not end in '-ed' are also included here as '-ed' adjectives.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>Was it a</i> <b>broken</b> <i>bone, a</i> <b>torn</b> <i>ligament, or what?</i></li>
</ul>
<p>The past participles of some <b>phrasal verbs</b> (see paragraphs <b>3.84 to 3.117</b>) can also be used as adjectives. When they are used attributively, the two parts of the phrasal verb are usually written with a hyphen between them.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>...the</i> <b>built-up</b> <i>urban mass of the city</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p class="clgm_hw">2.83</p>
<p>Most '-ed' adjectives are related to a transitive verb and have a passive meaning. They indicate that something has happened or is happening to the thing being described. For example, 'a frightened person' is a person who has been frightened by something. 'A known criminal' is a criminal who is known by the police.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>There are least one or two</i> <b>satisfied</b> <i>customers</i>.</li>
	<li><i>We cannot refuse to teach children the</i> <b>required</b> <i>subjects</i>.</li>
</ul>
