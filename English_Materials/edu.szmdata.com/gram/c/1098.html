<p class="subTitle">8.7 position of adverbial clause</p>
<p>The usual position for an adverbial clause is just after the main clause.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>I couldn't think of a single thing to say</i> <b>after he'd replied like that</b>.</li>
	<li><i>The performances were cancelled</i> <b>because the leading man was ill</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>However most types of adverbial clause can be put in front of a main clause.</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>When the city is dark</b>, <i>we can move around easily</i>.</li>
	<li><b>Although crocodiles are inactive for long periods</b>, <i>on occasion they can run very fast indeed</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Occasionally, you can put an adverbial clause in the middle of another clause, although this is unusual.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>They make allegations which</i>, <b>when you analyse them</b>, <i>do not have too many facts behind them</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are a few types of adverbial clause which always go after a main clause; other types always go in front of one. This is explained in the sections dealing with the different types of clause.</p>
