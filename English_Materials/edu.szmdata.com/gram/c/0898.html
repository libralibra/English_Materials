<p class="subTitle">5.106 relating events and times</p>
<p>You can also be more general by stating the relationship between an event and a period of time or specific point in time.</p>
<p>'Before', 'prior to', and 'after' can be used to relate events to a time:</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>She gets up</i> <b>before six</b>.</li>
	<li><i>If you're stuck come back and see me</i> <b>before Thursday</b>.</li>
	<li><i>...the construction of warships by the major powers</i> <b>prior to 1914</b>.</li>
	<li><i>City Music Hall is going to close down</i> <b>after Easter</b>.</li>
	<li><i>Clean up the kitchen</i> <b>after the weekend</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>or to another event:</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>I was in a bank for a while</i> <b>before the war</b>.</li>
	<li><i>She gave me much helpful advice</i> <b>prior to my visit to Turkey</b>.</li>
	<li><i>Jack left</i> <b>after breakfast</b>.</li>
	<li><i>He was killed in a car accident</i> <b>four years after their marriage</b>.</li>
	<li><b>After much discussion</b>, <i>they had decided to take the coin to a jeweller</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>'Following', 'previous to' and 'subsequent to' can also be used with events.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>These features increase the chances that we will be able to see and think clearly</i> <b>following a physical attack</b>.</li>
	<li><i>He suggests that Ross was prompted</i> <b>previous to the parade</b>.</li>
	<li><i>The testimony and description of one witness would be supplied prior to the interview; those of the other two</i> <b>subsequent to it</b>.</li>
</ul>
