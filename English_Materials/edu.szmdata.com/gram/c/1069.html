<p class="subTitle">7.61 Using reporting verbs for politeness</p>
<p>Reporting verbs are often used to say something in a polite way.</p>
<p class="clgm_hw">7.62</p>
<p>If you want to contradict someone or to say something which might be unwelcome to them, you can avoid sounding rude by using a reporting verb such as 'think' or 'believe'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>I think it's time we stopped</i>.</li>
	<li><i>I don't think that will be necessary</i>.</li>
	<li><i>I believe you ought to leave now</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Alternatively, you can make the reporting clause into a negative question.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>Don't you think we'd better wait and see?</i></li>
	<li><i>Don't you think you'd better slow down?</i></li>
</ul>
<p>For more information on the use of reporting verbs to decrease the strength of a statement, see the section on <b>performative verbs</b> in Chapter 10 (<b>10.102 to 10.105</b>).</p>
