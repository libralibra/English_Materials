<p class="subTitle">2.55 adjectives followed by 'to'-infinitive clauses</p>
<p>To complete the meaning of some adjectives which are used predicatively, you need to follow with a clause beginning with a <b>'to'-infinitive</b>. For example, you cannot just say 'He is unable'. You have to add a clause beginning with 'to'-infinitive such as 'to do': 'He is unable to do it'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>They were</i> <b>unable to help her</b>.</li>
	<li><i>I am</i> <b>willing to try</b>.</li>
	<li><i>We are</i> <b>liable to find ourselves in a mild state of conflict</b>.</li>
	<li><i>I am</i> <b>loath to dwell so long on the poor fellow</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is a list of adjectives t always or nearly always followed by 'to'-infinitive clauses:</p>
<ul>
	<li class="c_list"><b>able, bound, doomed, due, fated, fit, inclined, liable, likely, loath, prepared, unable, unwilling, willing</b></li>
</ul>
<p class="clgm_hw">2.56</p>
<p>You can also use a clause beginning with a 'to'-infinitive after many other adjectives to give more information about something.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>I was</i> <b>afraid to go home</b>.</li>
	<li><i>I was</i> <b>happy to see them again</b>.</li>
	<li><i>He was</i> <b>powerless to prevent it</b>.</li>
	<li><i>I was almost</i> <b>ashamed to tell her</b>.</li>
	<li><i>The path was</i> <b>easy to follow</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that the subject of the main clause is also the subject of the 'to'-infinitive clause.</p>
