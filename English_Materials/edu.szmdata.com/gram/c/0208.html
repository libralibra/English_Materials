<p class="subTitle">2.5 structure</p>
<p>Adjectives are nearly always used in connection with a noun or pronoun to give information about the person, thing, or group referred to. When this information is not the main purpose of a statement, adjectives are placed in front of a noun, as in 'hot coffee'. Adjectives which are used in a noun group are said to be used <b>attributively</b>.</p>
<p>The use of adjectives in a noun group is explained in paragraphs <b>2.19 to 2.20</b>.</p>
<p class="clgm_hw">2.6</p>
<p>Sometimes, however, the main purpose of a statement is to give the information expressed by an adjective. When this happens, adjectives are placed after a <b>link verb</b> such as 'be' or 'become', as in 'I am cold'. Adjectives which are used after a link verb are said to be used <b>predicatively</b>. They are called the <b>complement</b> of the link verb. The subject can be any noun group, including pronouns.</p>
<p>The use of adjectives as complements of a link verb is explained in paragraphs <b>3.133 to 3.138</b>.</p>
