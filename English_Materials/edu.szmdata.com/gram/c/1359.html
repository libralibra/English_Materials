<p class="subTitle">10.90 position of focusing adverbs</p>
<p>In careful writing, focusing adverbs are usually put immediately in front of the word or clause element they apply to, in order to avoid ambiguity. In speech, it is usually clear from the intonation of the speaker what they apply to.</p>
<p>However, in many cases the focusing adverb does not necessarily focus on the word or element immediately after it. For example, in the sentence 'He mainly reads articles about mechanical things' the word 'mainly' almost certainly applies to 'about mechanical things', not to 'reads'.</p>
<p>Focusing adverbs are not normally used at the beginning of a sentence. However, you can use 'only' to begin a sentence when it focuses on the thing that follows it.</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Only</b> <i>thirty-five per cent of four-year-olds get nursery education</i>.</li>
	<li><b>Only</b> <i>in science fiction is the topic touched on</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can use 'just' and 'simply' at the beginning of sentences giving instructions.</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Just</b> <i>add boiling water</i>.</li>
	<li><b>Simply</b> <i>remove one cube at a time</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>'Alone' is always used after the element that it focuses on. 'Only' is sometimes used in this position.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>It had always been felt that foster parents should make no profit --- the job should be done for love</i> <b>alone</b>.</li>
	<li><i>They were identified by their first names</i> <b>only</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>In informal speech and writing, other focusing adverbs are sometimes used after the element they focus on. For example, you can say 'We talked about me mostly' instead of 'We talked mostly about me'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>We have talked about France</i> <b>mainly</b>.</li>
	<li><i>Chocolate</i>, <b>particularly</b>, <i>is suspected of causing decay of the teeth</i>.</li>
	<li><i>In the early years</i>, <b>especially</b>, <i>a child may be afraid of many things</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>This position can also be used when adding a piece of information.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>He liked America, New York</i> <b>particularly</b>.</li>
	<li><i>She was busy writing, poetry</i> <b>mostly</b>.</li>
</ul>
