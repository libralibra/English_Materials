<p class="subTitle">10.102 Doing by saying: performative verbs</p>
<p>People sometimes explicitly say what function their statement is performing. They do this using 'I' and the simple present of a <b>reporting verb</b> such as 'admit' or 'promise' which refers to something that is done with words. For example, instead of saying 'I'll be there' you could say 'I promise I'll be there', which makes the statement stronger.</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>I suggest</b> <i>we draw up a document</i>.</li>
	<li><i>I'll be back at one</i>, <b>I promise</b>.</li>
	<li><i>I was somewhat shocked</i>, <b>I admit</b>, <i>by these events</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following verbs can be used in this way:</p>
<p><b>acknowledge, admit, assure, claim, concede, contend, demand, deny, guarantee, maintain, pledge, predict, promise, prophesy, propose, say, submit, suggest, swear, tell, vow, warn</b></p>
<p class="clgm_hw">10.103</p>
<p>Some other verbs which refer to doing something with words are used without a 'that'-clause after them. When used without a 'that'-clause, the use of the simple present with 'I' performs the function of a statement in itself, rather than commenting on another statement.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>I apologize for any delay</i>.</li>
	<li><i>I congratulate you with all my heart</i>.</li>
	<li><i>I forgive you</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following verbs are commonly used in this way:</p>
<p><b>absolve, accept, accuse, advise, agree, authorize, baptize, challenge, confess, congratulate, consent, declare, dedicate, defy, forbid, forgive, name, nominate, object, order, pronounce, protest, refuse, renounce, resign, second, sentence</b></p>
<p class="clgm_hw">10.104</p>
<p>The verbs in the above lists are sometimes called <b>performative verbs</b> or <b>performatives</b>, because they perform the action they refer to.</p>
