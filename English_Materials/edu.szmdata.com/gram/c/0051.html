<p class="subTitle">1.53 Referring to people and things by name: proper nouns</p>
<p>When you refer to a particular person, you can use their name. Names are usually called <b>proper nouns</b>.</p>
<p>People's names are spelled with a capital letter, and do not have a determiner in front of them.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>...Michael Hall</i>.</li>
	<li><i>...Jenny</i>.</li>
	<li><i>...Smith</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ways of using people's names when you are speaking to them directly are explained in paragraph <b>10.132</b>.</p>
<p class="clgm_hw">1.54</p>
<p>Sometimes a person's name can be used to refer to something they create. You can refer to a painting, sculpture, or book by a particular person by using the person's name like a count noun. You still spell it with a capital letter.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>In those days you could buy</i> <b>a Picasso</b> <i>for &pound;300</i>.</li>
	<li><i>I was looking at</i> <b>their Picassos and Matisses</b>.</li>
	<li><i>I'm reading</i> <b>an Agatha Christie</b> <i>at the moment</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can refer to music composed or performed by a particular person by using the person's name like an uncount noun.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>I remembered it while we were listening to</i> <b>the Mozart</b>.</li>
	<li><i>...instead of playing</i> <b>Chopin</b> <i>and</i> <b>Stravinsky</b> <i>all the time</i>.</li>
</ul>
