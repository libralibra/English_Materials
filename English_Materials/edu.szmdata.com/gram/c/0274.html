<p class="subTitle">2.112 position of comparatives</p>
<p>If you choose a qualifying phrase or clause beginning with 'than' when you are using a comparative as a modifier, you usually put the qualifier after the whole noun group, not directly after the comparative.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>Kairi was a</i> <b>more satisfactory</b> <i>pet</i> <b>than Tuku had been</b>.</li>
	<li><i>Willy owned a</i> <b>larger</b> <i>collection of books</i> <b>than anyone else I have ever met</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>A comparative can also come immediately after a noun, but only when it is followed by 'than' and a noun group.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>We've got a rat</i> <b>bigger than</b> <i>a cat living in our roof</i>.</li>
	<li><i>...and packs of eighteenth century cards</i> <b>larger than</b> <i>he was used to</i>.</li>
</ul>
