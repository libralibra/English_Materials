<p class="subTitle">1.139 structures used with 'any-'</p>
<p>Indefinite pronouns beginning with 'any-' can be used as the object or indirect object of a question or a negative clause.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>'I couldn't kill</i> <b>anybody</b>, <i>Dr Marlowe.'</i></li>
	<li><i>You still haven't told me</i> <b>anything</b>.</li>
	<li><i>Take a good look and tell me if you see</i> <b>anything</b> <i>different</i>.</li>
	<li><i>I haven't given</i> <b>anyone</b> <i>their presents yet</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>They are often used as the subject of both negative and affirmative questions. Note that they are not used as the subject of a negative statement. That is, you do not say 'Anybody can't come in'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>Does</i> <b>anybody</b> <i>agree with me?</i></li>
	<li><i>Won't</i> <b>anyone</b> <i>help me?</i></li>
	<li><i>If</i> <b>anything</b> <i>unusual happens, could you call me on this number?</i></li>
</ul>
<p>Note that when you are making an affirmative statement, 'anyone' and 'anybody' are used to refer to people in general and not to only one person.</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Anybody</b> <i>who wants to can come in and buy a car from me</i>.</li>
</ul>
