<p class="subTitle">2.155 USAGE NOTE</p>
<p>You can also indicate that you think something is sufficient by using 'enough'. 'Enough' always comes after the adjective, and never before it.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>I was not a</i> <b>good enough</b> <i>rider</i>.</li>
	<li><i>It seemed that Henry had not been</i> <b>careful enough</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>'Enough' can be followed by a prepositional phrase beginning with 'for' to indicate a person involved or a 'to-' infinitive clause to indicate a related action.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>A girl in the factory wasn't</i> <b>good enough for him</b>.</li>
	<li><i>If you find that the white wine is not</i> <b>cold enough for you</b>, <i>ask for some ice to be put in it</i>.</li>
	<li><i>The children are</i> <b>old enough to travel to school on their own</b>.</li>
	<li><i>None of the richly growing crops was</i> <b>ripe enough to eat</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that when 'enough' is used after an adjective, you can use 'just' in front of the adjective to indicate that someone or something has a sufficient amount of the quality described by the adjective, but no more than that.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>Some of these creatures are</i> <b>just large enough</b> <i>to see with the naked eye</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p class="clgm_hw">2.156</p>
<p>'Enough' can also be a determiner (see paragraphs <b>1.208 to 1.232</b>).</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>He hasn't had</i> <b>enough</b> <i>exercise</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>When 'enough' is used as a determiner, it can have a submodifier in front of it.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>There was</i> <b>just enough</b> <i>space for a bed</i>.</li>
	<li><i>They now have</i> <b>almost enough</b> <i>scholars</i>.</li>
</ul>
