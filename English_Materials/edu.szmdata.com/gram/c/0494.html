<p class="subTitle">3.88 intransitive phrasal verbs with prepositions</p>
<p>Other phrasal verbs used in intransitive clauses are verb plus preposition combinations.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>Ski trips now</i> <b>account for</b> <i>nearly half of all school visits</i>.</li>
	<li><i>I'</i><b>m</b> <i>just</i> <b>asking for</b> <i>information</i>.</li>
	<li><i>...the arguments that</i> <b>stem from</b> <i>gossip</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that the noun groups at the end of the above examples ('nearly half of all school visits', 'information', and 'gossip') are objects of the prepositions and not directly objects of the verbs.</p>
