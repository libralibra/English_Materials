<p class="subTitle">10.96 Introducing your statement: prefacing structures</p>
<p>People often use structures which point forward to what they are going to say and classify or label it in some way. These are called <b>prefacing structures</b> or <b>prefaces</b>.</p>
<p>A preface usually introduces the second part of the same sentence, usually a 'that'-clause or a 'wh'-clause, but occasionally a non-finite clause or a noun group. However, you can also use a whole sentence as the preface to another sentence (see paragraph 10.101).</p>
