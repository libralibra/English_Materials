<p class="subTitle">8.162 omitting determiners</p>
<p>When you refer to two people or things using 'and' or 'or', you usually repeat the determiner.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>He was holding</i> <b>a suitcase and a birdcage</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, if the people or things are closely associated in some way, you do not need to repeat the determiner.</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>My mother and father</b> <i>worked hard</i>.</li>
	<li><b>The jacket and skirt</b> <i>were skilfully designed</i>.</li>
	<li><i>...a boy in</i> <b>a jacket and tie</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sometimes both determiners are omitted.</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Mother and daughter</b> <i>stared at each other</i>.</li>
	<li><i>All this had of course been discussed between</i> <b>husband and wife</b>.</li>
	<li><i>The legal position for both</i> <b>worker and employer</b> <i>is now as fair as the law can make it</i>.</li>
</ul>
