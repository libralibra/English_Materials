<p class="subTitle">5.117 regular intervals</p>
<p>If you want to say that something happens at regular intervals, you can use 'every' followed by either a general or a specific unit of time. 'Each' is sometimes used instead of 'every'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>We'll go hunting</i> <b>every day</b>.</li>
	<li><i>You get a lump sum and you get a pension</i> <b>each week</b>.</li>
	<li><i>Some people write out a new address book</i> <b>every January</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>'Every' can also be used with a number and the plural of the unit of time.</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Every five minutes</b> <i>the phone would ring</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The regular or average rate or quantity of something can also be expressed using 'every' and 'each'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>One fighter jet was shot down</i> <b>every hour</b>.</li>
	<li><i>Academy schools send about 200 to the kiln</i> <b>every fortnight</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p class="clgm_hw">5.118</p>
<p>If something happens during one period of time but not during the next period, then happens again during the next, and so on, you can use 'every other' followed by a unit of time or a specific time word. 'Every second' is sometimes used instead of 'every other'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>We wrote</i> <b>every other day</b>.</li>
	<li><i>Their local committees are usually held</i> <b>every other month</b>.</li>
	<li><i>He used to come and take them out</i> <b>every other Sunday</b>.</li>
	<li><i>It seemed easier to shave only</i> <b>every second day</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Prepositional phrases with 'alternate' and a plural time word can also be used.</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>On alternate Sunday nights</b>, <i>I tell the younger children a story</i>.</li>
	<li><i>Just do some exercises</i> <b>on alternate days</b> <i>at first</i>.</li>
</ul>
