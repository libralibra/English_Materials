<p class="subTitle">5.99 approximate times</p>
<p>If you want to be less precise about when something happened, you can use an approximating adverb or approximating expression. It is also possible to use prepositions to relate events to less specific points or periods of time, for example when the exact time of an event is not known, or when events happen gradually, continuously, or several times.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>At</i> <b>about</b> <i>four o'clock in the morning, we were ambushed</i>.</li>
	<li><i>The device that exploded at</i> <b>around</b> <i>midnight on Wednesday severely damaged the fourth-floor bar</i>.</li>
	<li><i>The supply of servants continued until</i> <b>about</b> <i>1950, then abruptly dried up</i>.</li>
	<li><i>He developed central chest pain</i> <b>during the night</b>.</li>
	<li><i>For, also</i> <b>over the summer</b>, <i>his book had come out</i>.</li>
	<li><i>One morning</i> <b>before dawn</b> <i>Ark was beginning to wake me up as usual</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is a list of approximating adverbs and expressions:</p>
<ul>
	<li class="c_list"><b>about, around, almost, just after, just before, nearly, round about, shortly after, shortly before, soon after, thereabouts</b></li>
</ul>
<p>'About', 'around', 'almost', 'nearly', and 'round about', are usually used with clock times or years. With 'about', 'around', and 'round about', the preposition 'at' can often be omitted in informal English.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>Then quite suddenly</i>, <b>round about</b> <i>midday, my mood began to change</i>.</li>
	<li><b>About</b> <i>nine o'clock he went out to the kitchen</i>.</li>
