<p class="subTitle">9.63 Ellipsis in conversation</p>
<p>Ellipsis often occurs in conversation in replies and questions. When ellipsis occurs like this, it can involve ellipsis of the main verb in the ways that have been explained above (see paragraphs <b>9.49 to 9.62</b>). This is common with questions which show that you find what someone has said interesting or surprising, or that you do not agree with them. These questions always have a pronoun as their subject.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>'He gets free meals.' --- </i><b>'Does he?'</b></li>
	<li><i>'They're starting up a new arts centre there.' --- </i><b>'Are they?'</b></li>
	<li><i>'I've checked everyone.' --- </i><b>'Have you now?'</b></li>
</ul>
