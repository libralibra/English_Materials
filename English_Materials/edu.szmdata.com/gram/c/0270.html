<p class="subTitle">2.108 Comparing things: comparatives</p>
<p>You can describe something by saying that it has more of a quality than something else. You do this by using <b>comparative adjectives</b>. Only qualitative adjectives usually have comparatives, but a few colour adjectives also have them. Comparatives normally consist of the usual form of the adjective with either '-er' added to the end, as in 'harder' and 'smaller', or 'more' placed in front, as in 'more interesting' and 'more flexible'.</p>
<p>Note that 'good' and 'bad' have the irregular comparative forms 'better' and 'worse'.</p>
