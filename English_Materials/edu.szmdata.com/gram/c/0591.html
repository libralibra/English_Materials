<p class="subTitle">4.4 types of mood</p>
<p>There are three main moods in English. They are the <b>declarative mood</b>, the <b>interrogative mood</b>, and the <b>imperative mood</b>.</p>
<p>The <b>declarative mood</b> is the mood used in most main clauses. Statements are almost always made using the declarative mood. When a clause is in this mood, the subject is placed in front of the verb.</p>
<p>The declarative mood is sometimes called the <b>indicative mood</b>.</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>I want</b> <i>to talk to Mr Castle</i>.</li>
	<li><b>Gertrude looked</b> <i>at Anne</i>.</li>
	<li><b>We'll</b> <i>give you fifteen pounds now</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <b>interrogative mood</b> is the mood usually used in questions. In clauses in this mood, the subject is often placed after the main verb or after an auxiliary verb.</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Is she</b> <i>very upset?</i></li>
	<li><i>Where</i> <b>is my father?</b></li>
	<li><b>Have you</b> <i>met Halliday?</i></li>
	<li><b>Did you</b> <i>give him my letter?</i></li>
</ul>
<p>The <b>imperative mood</b> is the mood used to tell someone to do something. In clauses in the imperative mood, the subject is usually omitted and the <b>base form</b> of the verb is used.</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Give</b> <i>him a good book</i>.</li>
	<li><b>Show</b> <i>me the complete manuscript</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is a fourth mood called the <b>subjunctive mood</b>. This is a feature of English verbs which sometimes occurs in subordinate clauses. The subjunctive mood is not used to distinguish between different uses of language, and is therefore not dealt with in this chapter. Clauses in which the subjunctive mood occurs are explained in paragraphs <b>7.40</b>, <b>8.41</b>, and <b>8.48</b>.</p>
<p class="clgm_hw">4.5</p>
<p>The ways in which mood is used are explained in the following paragraphs.</p>
<p>Paragraphs <b>4.6 to 4.9</b> explain how the declarative mood is used to make statements. Paragraphs <b>4.10 to 4.30</b> explain how the interrogative mood is used to ask questions. Paragraphs <b>4.31 to 4.35</b> explain how the imperative mood is used to tell someone to do something. Other uses of the declarative, interrogative, and imperative moods are explained in paragraphs <b>4.36 to 4.42</b>.</p>
