<p class="subTitle">5.95 'on' for short periods of time</p>
<p>If you want to mention the day when something happens, you use 'on'. You can do this with named days, with days referred to by ordinals, and with days referred to by a special term such as 'birthday' or 'anniversary'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>I'll send the cheque round</i> <b>on Monday</b>.</li>
	<li><i>Everybody went to church</i> <b>on Christmas Day</b>.</li>
	<li><i>I hear you have bingo</i> <b>on Wednesday</b>.</li>
	<li><i>Pentonville Prison was set up</i> <b>on Boxing Day</b>, <i>1842</i>.</li>
	<li><i>He was born</i> <b>on 3 April 1925</b> <i>at 40 Grosvenor Road</i>.</li>
	<li><i>...the grey suit Elsa had bought for him</i> <b>on his birthday</b>.</li>
	<li><i>Many of Eisenhower's most cautious commanders were even prepared to risk attack</i> <b>on the eighth or ninth</b>.</li>
	<li><i>...addressing Parliament</i> <b>on the 36th anniversary</b> <i>of his country's independence</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can use 'the' with named days for emphasis or contrast, and 'a' to indicate any day of that name.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>He died</i> <b>on the Friday</b> <i>and was buried</i> <b>on the Sunday</b>.</li>
	<li><i>It is unlucky to cut your nails</i> <b>on a Friday</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>You also use 'on' with 'morning', 'afternoon', 'evening', and 'night' when they are modified or qualified.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>...at </i><b>2.30</b><i> p.m</i>. <b>on a calm afternoon</b>.</li>
	<li><i>There was another important opening</i> <b>on the same evening</b>.</li>
	<li><i>When she arrived at the court</i> <b>on the morning of the event</b>, <i>her voice had vanished</i>.</li>
	<li><i>It's terribly good of you to turn out</i> <b>on a night like this</b>.</li>
</ul>
