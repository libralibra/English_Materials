<p class="subTitle">1.127 Referring to people and things in a general way: indefinite pronouns</p>
<p>When you want to refer to people or things but you do not know exactly who or what they are, or their identity is not important, you can use an <b>indefinite pronoun</b>. An indefinite pronoun indicates only whether you are talking about people or about things, rather than referring to a specific person or thing.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>I was there for over an hour before</i> <b>anybody</b> <i>came</i>.</li>
	<li><i>Jack was waiting for</i> <b>something</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is a list of indefinite pronouns:</p>
<ul>
	<li class="c_list"><b>anybody, anyone, anything, everybody, everyone, everything, nobody, no one nothing, somebody, someone, something</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Note that all indefinite pronouns are written as one word except 'no one' which can also be spelled with a hyphen: 'no-one'.</p>
