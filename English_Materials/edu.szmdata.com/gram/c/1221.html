<p class="subTitle">8.189 linking adjectives</p>
<p>There are special rules for linking more than two adjectives.</p>
<p>When you put more than two <b>qualitative adjectives</b> in front of a noun, you put commas between the adjectives and do not use a conjunction.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>...a large, airy, comfortable room</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>When you put more than two <b>classifying adjectives</b> in front of a noun, you have to decide whether the adjectives relate to the same system of classification or to different systems. (This is explained in paragraph <b>8.171</b>.)</p>
<p>If the classifying adjectives relate to the same system, you put 'and' between the last two adjectives and a comma after each of the others.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>...the country's social, economic and political crisis</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the classifying adjectives relate to different systems of classification, you do not put anything between any of the adjectives.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>...an unknown medieval French poet</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>When you put both qualitative and classifying adjectives in front of a noun, you do not put anything between them.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>...a little white wooden house</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>When you put more than two adjectives after a <b>link verb</b>, you put 'and' between the last two adjectives and a comma after each of the others.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>He was big, dark and morose</i>.</li>
</ul>
