<p class="subTitle">1.145 Joining clauses together: relative pronouns</p>
<p>When a sentence consists of a main clause followed by a <b>relative clause</b> introduced by 'who', 'whom', 'which', or 'that', these words are known as <b>relative pronouns</b>.</p>
<p>Relative pronouns do two things at the same time. Like other pronouns, they refer to somebody or something that has already been mentioned. At the same time they are like <b>conjunctions</b>, because they join clauses together.</p>
<p>For more information about relative clauses, see paragraphs <b>8.83 to 8.116</b>.</p>
