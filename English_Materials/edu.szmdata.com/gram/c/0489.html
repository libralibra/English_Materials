<p class="subTitle">3.80 USAGE NOTE</p>
<p>There are some ditransitive verbs where the indirect object almost always comes in front of the direct object rather than being introduced by 'to' or 'for'. For example, you say 'He begrudged his daughter the bread she ate' and 'She allowed her son only two pounds a week'. It would be very unusual indeed to say 'She allowed two pounds a week to her son'.</p>
<p>Here is a list of verbs which do not usually have their indirect object introduced by 'to' or 'for':</p>
<ul>
	<li class="c_list"><b>allow, ask, begrudge, bet, cause, charge, cost, deny, draw, envy, forgive, grudge, promise, refuse</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Note that 'wish' can be used as this sort of ditransitive verb when its direct object is a word or phrase like 'luck', 'good luck', or 'happy birthday'.</p>
<p class="clgm_hw">3.81</p>
<p>When you use a passive form of a ditransitive verb, either the direct object or the indirect object can become the subject. See <b>10.20</b> for full information.</p>
