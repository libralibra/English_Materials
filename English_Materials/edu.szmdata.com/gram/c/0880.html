<p class="subTitle">5.85 clock times</p>
<p>Clock times are usually expressed in terms of hours and parts of an hour or minutes, for example 'one o'clock', 'five minutes past one', 'one twenty', 'half past one'. The day is usually divided into two sets of twelve hours, so it is sometimes necessary to specify which set you mean by adding 'a.m.', 'p.m.', or a prepositional phrase such as 'in the morning' or 'in the evening'.</p>
<p>In many official contexts, a twenty-four hour system is used.</p>
<p>If the hour is known, only the minutes are specified: 'five past, ten to, quarter to, half past' and so on. 'Midday' and 'noon' are occasionally used.</p>
