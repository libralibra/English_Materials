<p class="subTitle">1.112 typical use</p>
<p>You use possessive pronouns when you are talking about the same type of thing that has just been mentioned but want to indicate that it belongs to someone else.</p>
<p>For example, in the sentence 'Jane showed them her passport, then Richard showed them his', 'his' refers to a passport and indicates that it belongs to Richard.</p>
<p>Possessive pronouns are often used to contrast two things of the same type which belong to or are associated with different people. For example, 'Sarah's house is much bigger than ours'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>Her parents were in Malaya, and so were</i> <b>mine</b>.</li>
	<li><i>He grinned at her and laid his hand on</i> <b>hers</b>.</li>
	<li><i>Is that coffee</i> <b>yours</b> <i>or</i> <b>mine?</b></li>
	<li><i>My marks were higher than</i> <b>his</b>.</li>
	<li><i>Fred gambled his profits away while Julia spent</i> <b>hers</b> <i>all on dresses</i>.</li>
	<li><i>...the difference between his ideas and</i> <b>ours</b>.</li>
	<li><i>It was his fault, not</i> <b>theirs</b>.</li>
</ul>
