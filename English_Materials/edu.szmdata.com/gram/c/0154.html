<p class="subTitle">1.176 adding qualifiers</p>
<p>Another way of indicating who or what you are referring to is by adding a <b>qualifier</b> after 'the' and a noun, for example a prepositional phrase, a relative clause, a 'to'-infinitive, an adverb of place or time, or a phrase introduced by a participle.</p>
<p>So you might refer to particular people at a party by using noun groups such as 'the girl in the yellow dress', 'the woman who spilled her drink', or 'the man smoking a cigar'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>There is disorder among</i> <b>the papers on his desk</b>.</li>
	<li><b>The book that I recommend</b> <i>now costs over three pounds</i>.</li>
	<li><b>The thing to aim for</b> <i>is an office of your own</i>.</li>
	<li><i>Who made the bed in</i> <b>the room upstairs?</b></li>
	<li><i>It depends on</i> <b>the person being interviewed</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>For more information about qualifiers, see paragraphs <b>2.289 to 2.320</b>.</p>
