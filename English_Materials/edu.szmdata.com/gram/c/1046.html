<p class="subTitle">7.28 position of reported clauses</p>
<p>You usually put the reporting clause before the 'that'-clause, in order to make it clear that you are reporting rather than speaking directly yourself.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>I said that I would rather work in the forest</i>.</li>
	<li><i>Georgina said she was going to bed</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, if you want to emphasize the statement contained in the reported clause, you can alter the order and put the reported clause first, with a comma after it. You do not use 'that' to introduce the clause.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>All these things were trivial, he said</i>.</li>
	<li><i>She was worried, he thought</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the reported clause is long, you can put the reporting clause in the middle.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>Ten years ago, Moumoni explained, some government people had come to inspect the village</i>.</li>
</ul>
