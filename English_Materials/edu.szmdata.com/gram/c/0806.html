<p class="subTitle">4.258 'used to'</p>
<p>'Used to' has no inflected forms, and cannot be used with other modals.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>She</i> <b>used to</b> <i>get quite cross with Lally</i>.</li>
	<li><i>...these Westerns that</i> <b>used to</b> <i>do so well in Hollywood</i>.</li>
	<li><i>What did we</i> <b>used to</b> <i>call it?</i></li>
</ul>
<p>However, 'used to' can be used with the auxiliary verb 'do'. This is explained in paragraphs <b>4.261</b> and <b>4.262</b>.</p>
<p>'Used' is sometimes regarded as a modal, rather than 'used to'. 'Used' is then said to be followed by a 'to'-infinitive.</p>
<p class="clgm_hw">4.259</p>
<p>'Used to' is used to say that something happened regularly or existed in the past, although it no longer happens or exists.</p>
<p>'Used to' is similar to 'would' when it is used to describe repeated actions in the past. However, unlike 'would', 'used to' can also describe past states and situations.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>I'm not quite as mad as I</i> <b>used to</b> <i>be</i>.</li>
	<li><i>Actresses</i> <b>used to</b> <i>be very reluctant to wear tight corsets</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The use of 'would' to talk about things which happened regularly in the past is dealt with in paragraph <b>4.115</b>.</p>
