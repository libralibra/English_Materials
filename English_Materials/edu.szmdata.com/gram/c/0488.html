<p class="subTitle">3.79 USAGE NOTE</p>
<p>Note that the verbs 'bring', 'leave', 'play', 'sing', 'take', and 'write' are in both of the lists (<b>3.77</b> and <b>3.78</b>). That is because there are a few verbs which can take either 'to' or 'for' in front of the indirect object, depending on the meaning you want to express. For example, 'Karen wrote a letter to her boyfriend' means that the letter was addressed to her boyfriend and was for him to read. 'Karen wrote a letter for her boyfriend' means that her boyfriend wanted to send someone else a letter and Karen was the person who actually wrote it.</p>
