<p class="subTitle">3.56 Verbs which can take an object or a prepositional phrase</p>
<p>There is a small group of verbs which can be followed by either an object or a prepositional phrase. The verb 'fight' is one of these verbs, so that, for example, you can say 'He fought the enemy' or 'He fought against the enemy'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>The Polish Army</i> <b>fought the Germans</b> <i>for nearly five weeks</i>.</li>
	<li><i>He</i> <b>was fighting against history</b>.</li>
	<li><i>The New Zealand rugby team</i> <b>played South Africa's Springboks</b>.</li>
	<li><i>In his youth, Thomas</i> <b>had played against Glamorgan</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p class="clgm_hw">3.57</p>
<p>There is usually little difference in meaning between using the verb on its own and following it with a preposition. For example, there is very little difference in meaning between 'brush' and 'brush against', 'gnaw' and 'gnaw at', and 'hiss' and 'hiss at' in the following examples.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>Her arm</i> <b>brushed my cheek</b>.</li>
	<li><i>Something</i> <b>brushed against the back of the shelter</b>.</li>
	<li><i>Rabbits often</i> <b>gnaw the woodwork of their cages</b>.</li>
	<li><i>Insects</i> <b>had been gnawing at the wood</b>.</li>
	<li><i>They</i> <b>hissed the Mayor</b> <i>at the ceremony</i>.</li>
	<li><i>Frederica</i> <b>hissed at him</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p class="clgm_hw">3.58</p>
<p>Here is a list of verbs which can be used with a direct object or a prepositional phrase, with little difference in meaning:</p>
<ul>
	<li class="c_list"><b>boo (at), brush (against), check (on), distinguish (between), enter (for), fight (against), fight (with), gain (in), gnaw (at), hiss (at), infiltrate (into), jeer (at), juggle (with), mock (at), mourn (for), nibble (at), play (against), rule (over), sip (at), sniff (at), tug (at), twiddle (with)</b></li>
</ul>
