<p class="subTitle">4.109 USAGE NOTE</p>
<p>You sometimes use a modal on its own, without a following verb. You do this when you are repeating a modal. For example, if someone says 'I expect Margaret will come tonight', you can say 'I hope she will', meaning 'I hope she will come'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>'I</i> <b>must go</b>.<i>' --- 'I suppose you</i> <b>must.'</b></li>
	<li><i>'You</i> <b>should have become an archaeologist</b>.<i>' --- 'You're dead right, I</i> <b>should.'</b></li>
	<li><i>If you</i> <b>can't do it</b>, <i>we'll find someone who</i> <b>can</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also omit the verb following a modal when this verb has just been used without a modal, or with a different modal. For example, if someone says 'George has failed his exam', you can say 'I thought he would', meaning 'I thought he would fail his exam'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>You</i> <b>learned to deal with each other</b>. <i>We never</i> <b>will</b>.</li>
	<li><i>They had come to believe that it not only</i> <b>must go on for ever</b> <i>but that it</i> <b>should</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>However you cannot omit the verb 'be' after a modal when you have just used it without a modal. For example, if someone says 'Is he a teacher?', you cannot say 'I think he might'. You must say 'I think he might be'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>Linguistics</i> <b>is</b> <i>not yet a science and perhaps never</i> <b>will be</b>.</li>
	<li><i>The Board's methods</i> <b>are</b> <i>not as stringent as they</i> <b>could be</b>.</li>
	<li><i>Relations between the two countries</i> <b>have not been</b> <i>as smooth as they</i> <b>might have been</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The feature of language in which you omit certain words to avoid repeating them is called <b>ellipsis</b>. For more information about ellipsis in verb groups see paragraphs <b>9.49 to 9.69</b>.</p>
