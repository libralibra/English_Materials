<p class="subTitle">1.169 formal generalizations</p>
<p>Nouns referring to living things can be used in the singular with 'the' when you are making a statement about every member of a species. For example, if you say 'The swift has long, narrow wings', you mean that all swifts have long, narrow wings.</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>The primrose</b> <i>can grow abundantly on chalk banks</i>.</li>
	<li><i>Australia is the home of</i> <b>the kangaroo</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Similarly, a noun referring to a part of the human body can be used with 'the' to refer to that part of anyone's body.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>These arteries supply</i> <b>the heart</b> <i>with blood</i>.</li>
	<li><i>It is irritating when breathed into</i> <b>the lungs</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>'The' is sometimes used with other nouns in the singular to make a statement about all the members of a group.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>Too often these writings dwell on how to protect</i> <b>the therapist</b> <i>rather than on how to cure</i> <b>the patient</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>These uses are fairly formal. They are not common in ordinary speech. Usually, if you want to make a statement about all the things of a particular kind, you use the plural form of a noun without a determiner. See paragraph <b>1.212</b> for more information about this.</p>
