<p class="subTitle">2.165 USAGE NOTE</p>
<p>If you want to say that something has more of a quality than something else which already has a lot it, you can use 'even' or 'still' before a comparative adjective, or 'still' after it.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>She's</i> <b>even lazier</b> <i>than me!</i></li>
	<li><i>She was</i> <b>even more possessive</b> <i>than Rosamund</i>.</li>
	<li><i>I had a</i> <b>still more recent</b> <i>report</i>.</li>
	<li><i>The text is actually</i> <b>worse still</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Similarly, you can use 'even' or 'still' to say that something has less of a quality than something else which has little of this quality.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>Selection and assessment tend to be</i> <b>even less</b> <i>fair</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also use 'even' or 'still' when comparing the amount of a quality that something has at one time with the amount that it has at another.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>Their non-nuclear superiority has grown</i> <b>even bigger</b> <i>since 1967</i>.</li>
	<li><i>They will become</i> <b>richer still</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>In formal or literary English, 'yet' is sometimes used as a submodifier in the same way as 'still'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>He would have been</i> <b>yet more alarmed</b> <i>had she withdrawn</i>.</li>
	<li><i>The planes grow</i> <b>mightier yet</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p class="clgm_hw">2.166</p>
<p>You can indicate that something has an increasing or decreasing amount of a quality by repeating comparative adjectives. For example, you can say that something is getting 'bigger and bigger', 'more and more difficult', or 'less and less common'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>He's getting</i> <b>fatter and fatter</b>.</li>
	<li><i>...defences that were proving</i> <b>more and more effective</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>'Increasingly' can be used instead of 'more and more' and 'decreasingly' instead of 'less and less'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>I was becoming</i> <b>increasingly</b> <i>depressed</i>.</li>
	<li><i>It was the first of a number of</i> <b>increasingly</b> <i>frank talks</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p class="clgm_hw">2.167</p>
<p>If you want to say that something has a little more or a little less of a quality than something else, you can use 'rather', 'slightly', 'a bit', 'a little bit', or 'a little' with comparative adjectives.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>It's a</i> <b>rather more complicated</b> <i>story than that</i>.</li>
	<li><i>She's only</i> <b>a little bit taller</b> <i>than her sister</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also use these constructions to say that something has a little more or a little less of a quality than it had before.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>We must be</i> <b>rather more visible</b> <i>to people in the community</i>.</li>
	<li><i>...the little things that made life</i> <b>slightly less intolerable</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p class="clgm_hw">2.168</p>
<p>If you want to say emphatically that something has no more of a quality than something else or than it had before, you can use 'no' in front of comparative adjectives.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>Some species of dinosaur were</i> <b>no bigger</b> <i>than a chicken</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>'Any' is used for emphasis in front of comparatives in negative clauses, questions, and conditional clauses. For example, 'He wasn't any taller than Jane' means the same as 'He was no taller than Jane'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>I was ten and didn't look</i> <b>any older</b>.</li>
	<li><i>If it will make you</i> <b>any happier</b>, <i>I'll shave off my beard</i>.</li>
	<li><i>Is that</i> <b>any clearer?</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Note that you can only use 'no' and 'any' like this when comparatives are being used as <b>complements</b>. You cannot use 'no' and 'any' with comparatives when they are being used in front of a noun group. For example, you cannot say 'It was a no better meal' or 'Is that an any faster train?'</p>
<p class="clgm_hw">2.169</p>
<p>When you use the comparative structure 'as ... as ...' (see paragraphs <b>2.129 to 2.135</b>), submodifiers such as 'just', 'quite', 'nearly', and 'almost' can be used in front of it, modifying the comparison with their usual meanings.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>Mary was</i> <b>just as pale as</b> <i>he was</i>.</li>
	<li><i>They set upon insects</i> <b>quite as large as</b> <i>themselves</i>.</li>
	<li><i>...a huge bird which was</i> <b>nearly as big as</b> <i>a man</i>.</li>
	<li><i>The land seemed</i> <b>almost as dark as</b> <i>the water</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>'Nearly' can also be used as a submodifier when the 'as ... as ...' structure is preceded by 'not' with the meaning 'less......than'. You put it after the 'not'. For example, 'I am not nearly as tall as George' means the same as 'I am much less tall than George'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>This is</i> <b>not nearly as complicated as</b> <i>it sounds</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p class="clgm_hw">2.170</p>
<p>When you use 'like' to describe someone or something by comparing them with someone or something else (see paragraphs <b>2.137 to 2.139</b>), you can put several submodifiers in front of 'like', including 'just', 'exactly', 'very', 'quite', 'rather', 'somewhat', 'a little', and 'a bit'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>...animals that looked</i> <b>a little like</b> <i>donkeys</i>.</li>
	<li><i>It's a plane</i> <b>exactly like</b> <i>his</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is a list of submodifiers used with 'like':</p>
<ul>
	<li class="c_list"><b>a bit, a little, exactly, just, quite, rather, somewhat, very</b></li>
</ul>
<p class="clgm_hw">2.171</p>
<p>When you use 'the same as' and 'the same' to describe someone or something by saying they are identical to someone or something else, you can use a number of submodifiers in front of them, including 'just', 'exactly', 'much', 'nearly', 'virtually', and 'more or less'. These modify the meaning with their usual meanings.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>She wore plimsolls</i>, <b>just the same as</b> <i>the ones we wore at school</i>.</li>
	<li><i>The situation was</i> <b>much the same</b> <i>in Germany</i>.</li>
	<li><i>The moral code would seem to be</i> <b>more or less the same</b> <i>throughout the world</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p class="clgm_hw">2.172</p>
<p>When you are using superlative adjectives, you may wish to say that something has much more or much less of a quality than anything else of its kind. As with comparatives, you can do this by using <b>submodifiers</b>.</p>
<p>The submodifiers 'much', 'quite', 'easily', 'by far', and 'very' can be used with the superlative adjectives.</p>
<p>'Much', 'quite', and 'easily' are placed in front of 'the' and the superlative.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>Music may have been</i> <b>much the most respectable</b> <i>of his tastes</i>.</li>
	<li><i>...the most frightening time of my life, and</i> <b>quite the most dishonest</b>.</li>
	<li><i>The Granada is</i> <b>easily the most popular</b> <i>model</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>'By far' can be placed either in front of 'the' and the superlative or after the superlative.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>They are</i> <b>by far the most dangerous</b> <i>creatures on the island</i>.</li>
	<li><i>The Union was the largest</i> <b>by far</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p class="clgm_hw">2.173</p>
<p>'Very' can only be used with superlatives formed by adding '-est' or with irregular superlatives such as 'the best' and 'the worst'. 'Very' is placed between 'the' and the superlative.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i></i>...<b>the very earliest</b> <i>computers</i>.</li>
	<li><i>It was of</i> <b>the very highest</b> <i>quality</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>'Very' can also be used to submodify superlative adjectives when you want to be very emphatic. It is placed after a determiner such as 'the' or 'that' and in front of a superlative adjective or one such as 'first' or 'last'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>...in the</i> <b>very smallest</b> <i>countries</i>.</li>
	<li><i>...one of the</i> <b>very finest</b> <i>breeds of dogs</i>.</li>
	<li><i>...on the</i> <b>very first</b> <i>day of the war</i>.</li>
	<li><i>He had come at the</i> <b>very last</b> <i>moment</i>.</li>
	<li><i>That</i> <b>very next</b> <i>afternoon he was working in his room</i>.</li>
	<li><i>He spent weeks in that</i> <b>very same</b> <i>basement</i>.</li>
</ul>
