<p class="subTitle">3.181 use in transitive structures</p>
<p>A number of transitive verbs can be used with 'as' after their object.</p>
<p>With some, a noun group is used after 'as'. The 'as' phrase describes the role of the object or what it is thought to be.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>I wanted to use him</i> <b>as an agent</b>.</li>
	<li><i>I treated business</i> <b>as a game</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is a list of transitive verbs which can be used with 'as' and a noun group:</p>
<ul>
	<li class="c_list"><b>brand, cast, categorize, certify, characterize, choose, class, condemn, consider, define, denounce, depict, describe, diagnose, elect, establish, give, hail, identify, intend, interpret, label, name, perceive, recognize, regard, scorn, see, suggest, take, treat, use, view</b></li>
</ul>
<p>With others, an adjective is used after 'as'. The adjective indicates what quality or characteristic the object is thought to have.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>Party members and officials</i> <b>described him as brilliant</b>.</li>
	<li><i>They</i> <b>regarded manual work as degrading</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is a list of transitive verbs which can be used with 'as' and an adjective:</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p class="clgm_hw">3.182</p>
<p>'Look upon', 'refer to', and 'think of' can also be used with 'as' in this way. 'As' must be followed by a noun group when used with 'refer to'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>In some households the man</i> <b>was referred to as 'the master'</b>.</li>
</ul>
