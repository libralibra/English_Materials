<p class="subTitle">3.74 Verbs which can have two objects: ditransitive verbs</p>
<p>Sometimes you may want to talk about an event which involves someone in addition to the people or things that are the subject and object of the clause. This third participant is someone who benefits from the action or receives something as a result. They become the <b>indirect object</b> of the clause. The <b>direct object</b> is the person or thing that something is done to, as normal. For example, in 'I gave John a book', 'John' is the indirect object and 'the book' is the direct object.</p>
<p>Verbs which can take both a direct object and an indirect object are called <b>ditransitive verbs</b>.</p>
<p>The indirect object is put immediately after the verb group, in front of the direct object.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>Dad gave</i> <b>me</b> <b>a car</b>.</li>
	<li><i>Dr Robey handed</i> <b>David</b> <b>a piece of string</b>.</li>
	<li><i>She brought</i> <b>me</b> <b>a boiled egg and toast</b>.</li>
	<li><i>We teach</i> <b>children</b> <b>the required subjects</b>.</li>
	<li><i>He had lent</i> <b>Tim</b> <b>the money</b>.</li>
	<li><i>A man promised</i> <b>him</b> <b>a job</b>.</li>
</ul>
