<p class="subTitle">1.47 typical meanings: clothes and tools</p>
<p>Two special groups of nouns are usually plural: nouns referring to clothes and some other things that people wear, and nouns referring to tools and some other things that people use.</p>
<p>This is because some clothes and tools, such as 'trousers' and 'scissors', are made up of two similar parts.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>She wore brown</i> <b>trousers</b> <i>and a green sweater</i>.</li>
	<li><i>He took off his</i> <b>glasses</b>.</li>
	<li><i>...using the</i> <b>pliers</b> <i>from the toolbox</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>When you want to refer to these items in general, or to an unspecified number of them, you use the plural form with no determiner.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>Never poke</i> <b>scissors</b> <i>into a light bulb socket</i>.</li>
	<li><i>The man was watching the train through</i> <b>binoculars</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is a list of some plural nouns which refer to clothes and other things that people wear:</p>
<ul>
	<li class="c_list"><b>bermudas, braces, briefs, cords, corduroys, culottes, dungarees, flannels, flares, galoshes, glasses, jeans, jodhpurs, knickerbockers, knickers, leggings, overalls, panties, pants, pyjamas, shorts, slacks, specs, spectacles, sunglasses, tights, trousers, trunks, underpants</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Here is a list of plural nouns which refer to tools and other things that people use:</p>
<ul>
	<li class="c_list"><b>binoculars, clippers, compasses, dividers, field-glasses, nutcrackers, pincers, pliers, scales, scissors, secateurs, shears, tongs, tweezers</b></li>
</ul>
<p>When you want to refer to a single piece of clothing or a single tool, you can use 'some' or 'a pair of' in front of the noun. You can refer to more than one item by using a number or a quantifier with 'pairs of'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>I got</i> <b>some scissors</b> <i>out of the kitchen drawer</i>.</li>
	<li><i>I was sent out to buy</i> <b>a pair of scissors</b>.</li>
	<li><i>He was wearing</i> <b>a pair of</b> <i>old grey</i> <b>trousers</b>.</li>
	<li><i>Liza has</i> <b>three pairs of jeans</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also use 'a pair of' when you are talking about things such as gloves, shoes, and socks which typically occur in twos.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i></i>...<b>a pair of</b> <i>new</i> <b>gloves</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>A possessive determiner such as 'my' can be used instead of 'a'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i></i>...<b>his</b> <i>favourite</i> <b>pair of shoes</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>When you use 'a pair of' with a noun in the plural form, the verb is singular if it is in the same clause. If the verb is in a following relative clause, it is usually plural.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>It is likely that</i> <b>a</b> <i>new</i> <b>pair of shoes brings</b> <i>more happiness to a child than a new car brings to a grown-up</i>.</li>
	<li><i>I always wear a pair of long pants underneath, or</i> <b>a pair of pyjamas is</b> <i>just as good</i>.</li>
	<li><i>He put on</i> <b>a pair of</b> <i>brown</i> <b>shoes</b>, <i>which</i> <b>were</b> <i>waiting there for him</i>.</li>
	<li><i>He wore</i> <b>a pair of earphones</b>, <i>which</i> <b>were</b> <i>plugged into a tape-recorder</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>You use a plural pronoun after 'a pair of'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>She went to the wardrobe, chose</i> <b>a pair of shoes</b>, <i>put</i> <b>them</b> <i>on and leaned back in the chair</i>.</li>
	<li><i>He brought out</i> <b>a pair of dark glasses</b> <i>and handed</i> <b>them</b> <i>to Walker</i>.</li>
</ul>
