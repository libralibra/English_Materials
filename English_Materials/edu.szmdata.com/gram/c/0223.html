<p class="subTitle">2.33 adjectives which are of both types</p>
<p>Some adjectives can be either <b>qualitative</b> or <b>classifying</b>depending on the meaning that you want to convey. For example, in 'an emotional person', 'emotional' is a qualitative adjective meaning 'feeling or expressing strong emotions', and it has a comparative and superlative and it can be used with submodifiers. Thus, a person can be 'very emotional', 'rather emotional', or 'more emotional' than someone else. However, in 'the emotional needs of children', 'emotional' is a classifying adjective meaning 'relating to a person's emotions', and so it cannot be submodified.</p>
<p>Here is a list of adjectives frequently used both as qualitative adjectives and as classifying adjectives:</p>
<ul>
	<li class="c_list"><b>academic, conscious, dry, educational, effective, emotional, extreme, late, modern, moral, objective, ordinary, regular, religious, revolutionary, rural, scientific, secret, similar</b></li>
</ul>
