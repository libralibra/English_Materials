<p class="subTitle">8.188 Linking more than two clauses or word groups</p>
<p>You can link more than two clauses, words, or word groups using 'and' or 'or'. Usually you use the conjunction only once, putting it between the last two clauses, words, or word groups. After each of the others you put a comma.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>Haggarty marched him to the door, literally threw him out</i> <b>and</b> <i>returned</i>.</li>
	<li><i>After dark, avoid lonely places such as commons, churchyards, alleys</i> <b>and</b> <i>waste land</i>.</li>
	<li><i>...courses in accountancy, science, maths</i> <b>or</b> <i>engineering</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some people also put a comma in front of the conjunction. We do this in this grammar.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>Mrs Roberts cooked, cleaned, mended</i><b>, and</b> <i>went to meetings of the sewing club</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>In informal speech, people sometimes put 'and' or 'or' between each pair of clauses, words, or word groups. You only do this in writing when you want to emphasize that all the statements you are making are true, or to make it clear that what you are saying applies to all the people or things you are mentioning.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>Mrs Barnett has a gate</i> <b>and</b> <i>it's not locked</i> <b>and</b> <i>that's how they get out</i>.</li>
	<li><i>They didn't think about the political implications of welcoming a German</i> <b>or</b> <i>a Frenchman</i> <b>or</b> <i>an Italian</i>.</li>
	<li><i>...religions that have long ago lost their love</i> <b>and</b> <i>hope</i> <b>and</b> <i>charity</i>.</li>
</ul>
