<p class="subTitle">1.119 used as objects of prepositions</p>
<p>If the subject of a clause and the object of a preposition refer to the same person and the clause does not have a direct object, you use a reflexive pronoun after the preposition.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>I was thoroughly ashamed of</i> <b>myself</b>.</li>
	<li><i>Barbara stared at</i> <b>herself</b> <i>in the mirror</i>.</li>
	<li><i>We think of</i> <b>ourselves</b> <i>as members of the local community</i>.</li>
	<li><i>They can't cook for</i> <b>themselves</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, if the clause does have a direct object, you usually use a personal pronoun after the preposition.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>I will take it home with</i> <b>me</b>.</li>
	<li><i>They put the book between</i> <b>them</b> <i>on the kitchen table</i>.</li>
	<li><i>I shivered and drew the rug around</i> <b>me</b>.</li>
	<li><i>Mrs Bixby went out, slamming the door behind</i> <b>her</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that if the clause has a direct object and it is not obvious that the subject of the clause and the object of the preposition refer to the same person, you use a reflexive pronoun. For example, 'The Managing Director gave the biggest pay rise to himself'.</p>
