<p class="subTitle">3.11 intransitive verbs followed by prepositional phrases</p>
<p>Many intransitive verbs always or typically have an adjunct after them. With some, the adjunct must be a prepositional phrase beginning with a particular preposition. This use of a preposition allows something affected by the action to be mentioned, as the object of the preposition.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>Everything you see here</i> <b>belongs to</b> <i>me</i>.</li>
	<li><i>Landlords often</i> <b>resorted to</b> <i>violence</i>.</li>
	<li><i>I</i> <b>sympathized with</b> <i>them</i>.</li>
	<li><i>I</i><b>'m relying on</b> <i>Bill</i>.</li>
	<li><i>He</i> <b>yearned for</b> <i>academic recognition</i>.</li>
</ul>
