<p class="subTitle">1.35 When there is only one of something: singular nouns</p>
<p>There are certain things in the world that are unique. There are other things which you almost always want to talk about one at a time. This means that there are some nouns, or more often some meanings of nouns, for which only a singular form is used.</p>
<p>When a noun is used with such a meaning, it is called a <b>singular noun</b>. Singular nouns are always used with a determiner, because they behave like the singular form of a count noun.</p>
