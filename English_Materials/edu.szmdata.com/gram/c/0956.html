<p class="subTitle">6.41 circumstances</p>
<p>Adverbs of manner can also indicate the circumstances in which something is done, rather than how it is done. For example, in the sentence 'He spoke to me privately' 'privately' means 'when no one else was present' rather than 'in a private way'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>After dinner she got hold of the President and spoke to him</i> <b>privately</b>.</li>
	<li><i>He had</i> <b>publicly</b> <i>called for an investigation of the entire school system</i>.</li>
	<li><i>Britain and France</i> <b>jointly</b> <i>suggested a plan in 1954</i>.</li>
	<li><i>Since then I have undertaken all the enquiries</i> <b>personally</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p class="clgm_hw">6.42</p>
<p>Here is a list of common adverbs which are used to indicate the circumstances in which an action takes place:</p>
<ul>
	<li class="c_list"><b>accidentally, alone, artificially, automatically, bodily, collectively, commercially, deliberately, directly, duly, first-class, full-time, illegally, independently, indirectly, individually, innocently, instinctively, involuntarily, jointly, legally, logically, mechanically, naturally, officially, openly, overtly, part-time, personally, politically, privately, publicly, regardless, retail, scientifically, secretly, solo, specially, symbolically, wholesale</b></li>
