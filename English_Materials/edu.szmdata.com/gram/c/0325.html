<p class="subTitle">2.188 Other structures with apostrophe s / 's</p>
<p>When you are talking about two things of the same type which belong to different people you can use the possessive form of a name or noun like a possessive pronoun so that you can omit repeating the thing itself. In the first example below, 'David's' is used instead of 'David's hand'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Her hand</b> <i>felt different from</i> <b>David's</b>.</li>
	<li><i>Her tone was more friendly than</i> <b>Stryker's</b>.</li>
	<li><i>It is your responsibility rather than your</i> <b>parents'</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The possessive form can also be used on its own to refer to someone's home or place of work.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>He's round at</i> <b>David's</b>.</li>
	<li><i>She stopped off at the</i> <b>butcher's</b> <i>for a piece of steak</i>.</li>
	<li><i>She hasn't been back to the</i> <b>doctor's</b> <i>since</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Possessive pronouns are explained in paragraphs <b>1.110 to 1.114</b>.</p>
