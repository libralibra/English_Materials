<p class="subTitle">3.201 USAGE NOTE</p>
<p>Note that when the base form of 'try' is used, for example as an <b>imperative</b> or with a <b>modal</b>, it is sometimes used with 'and' followed by the base form of the second verb, rather than with a 'to'-infinitive. The two actions seem to be separate, because of the 'and', but are in fact very closely linked.</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Try and get</b> <i>a torch or a light, it's terribly dark down here</i>.</li>
	<li><i>I'll</i> <b>try and answer</b> <i>the question</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some speakers consider this to be informal or incorrect.</p>
<p>'Come' and 'go' are often used in a similar way with 'and', in simple tenses as well as in the base form. The verb after 'and' can also inflect.</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Come and see</b> <i>me whenever you feel depressed</i>.</li>
	<li><i>I</i> <b>went and fetched</b> <i>another glass</i>.</li>
</ul>
