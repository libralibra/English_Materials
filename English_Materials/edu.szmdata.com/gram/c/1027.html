<p class="subTitle">7.1 Reporting what people say or think</p>
<p>This chapter of the grammar explains the different ways of reporting what people say or think.</p>
<p class="clgm_hw">7.2</p>
<p>One way of reporting what someone has said is to repeat their actual words.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>'I don't know much about music,' Judy said</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>A sentence like this is called a <b>quote structure</b>.</p>
<p>Instead of reporting Judy's words, the writer could have said, 'Judy said that she didn't know much about music'. This is called a <b>report structure</b>.</p>
<p>Quote structures and report structures both consist of two clauses. The main clause is called a <b>reporting clause</b>. The other clause indicates what someone said or thought.</p>
<p>In a <b>quote structure</b>, this other clause is called the <b>quote</b>.</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>'Have you met him?'</b> <i>I asked</i>.</li>
	<li><b>'Of course we can get married,'</b> <i>said Gertrude</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>In a <b>report structure</b>, the other clause is called the <b>reported clause</b>.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>He mentioned</i> <b>that he couldn't stand shouting</b>.</li>
	<li><i>He asked</i> <b>if you would be able to call and see him</b>.</li>
	<li><i>He intended</i> <b>to give me the money</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that the reported clause can be a non-finite clause beginning with a 'to'-infinitive.</p>
<p class="clgm_hw">7.3</p>
<p>In ordinary conversation, we use <b>report structures</b> much more often than <b>quote structures</b>. This is because we usually do not know, or cannot remember, the exact words that someone has said. <b>Quote structures</b> are mainly used in written stories.</p>
<p>When we report people's thoughts, we almost always use <b>report structures</b>, because thoughts do not usually exist in the form of words, so we cannot quote them exactly. <b>Report structures</b> can be used to report almost any kind of thought.</p>
<p class="clgm_hw">7.4</p>
<p>Paragraphs <b>7.5 to 7.13</b> explain verbs used in <b>reporting clauses</b>. Paragraphs <b>7.14 to 7.23</b> explain <b>quote structures</b>. Paragraphs <b>7.24 to 7.67</b> explain <b>report structures</b>. Paragraphs <b>7.68 to 7.77</b> explain how to refer to the speaker and hearer in a quote structure or report structure. Paragraphs <b>7.78 to 7.81</b> explain other ways of indicating what someone says or talks about. Paragraphs <b>7.82 to 7.94</b> explain other ways of using reported clauses.</p>
