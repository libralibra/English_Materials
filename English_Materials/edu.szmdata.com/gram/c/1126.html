<p class="subTitle">8.54 Result clauses</p>
<p>When you want to indicate the result of something, you use a <b>result clause</b>.</p>
<p>Result clauses always come after the main clause.</p>
<p class="clgm_hw">8.55</p>
<p>Result clauses usually begin with 'so that'.</p>
<p>You can use 'so that' simply to say what the result of an event or situation was.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>My suitcase had become damaged on the journey home</i>, <b>so that</b> <i>the lid would not stay closed</i>.</li>
	<li><i>A great storm had brought the sea right into the house</i>, <b>so that</b> <i>they had been forced to make their escape by a window at the back</i>.</li>
	<li><i>Many wives shoulder the prime responsibility for running the home</i>, <b>so that</b> <i>in most families the loss of the wife is more devastating than the loss of the husband</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>'So', 'and so', and 'and' can also be used.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>The young do not have the money to save and the old are consuming their savings</i>, <b>so</b> <i>it is mainly the middle-aged who are saving</i>.</li>
	<li><i>She was having great difficulty getting her car out</i>, <b>and so</b> <i>I had to move my car to let her out</i>.</li>
	<li><i>Her boy friend was shot in the chest</i> <b>and</b> <i>died</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>With these result clauses, you usually put a comma after the main clause.</p>
<p class="clgm_hw">8.56</p>
<p>You can also use 'so that' to say that something is or was done in a particular way to achieve a desired result.</p>
<p>For example, 'He fixed the bell so that it would ring when anyone came in' means 'He fixed the bell in such a way that it would ring when anyone came in'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>Explain it</i> <b>so that</b> <i>a 10-year-old could understand it</i>.</li>
	<li><i>They arranged things</i> <b>so that</b> <i>they never met</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>With these result clauses, you do NOT put a comma after the main clause.</p>
<p class="clgm_hw">8.57</p>
<p>'So that' is also used in <b>finite purpose clauses</b>. This use is explained in paragraph <b>8.47</b>.</p>
<p class="clgm_hw">8.58</p>
<p>'So' and 'that' are also used in a special kind of structure to say that a result happens because something has a quality to a particular extent, or because something is done in an extreme way.</p>
<p>In these structures, 'so' is used as a <b>modifier</b> in front of an adjective or adverb. A 'that'-clause is then added as a <b>qualifier</b>. Seeparagraph <b>2.309</b> for similar structures to the one described in this paragraph.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>The crowd was</i> <b>so</b> <i>large</i> <b>that it overflowed the auditorium</b>.</li>
	<li><i>They were</i> <b>so</b> <i>surprised</i> <b>they didn't try to stop him</b>.</li>
	<li><i>He dressed</i> <b>so</b> <i>quickly</i> <b>that he put his boots on the wrong feet</b>.</li>
	<li><i>She had fallen down</i> <b>so</b> <i>often</i> <b>that she was covered in mud</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sometimes 'as' is used instead of 'that'. 'As' is followed by a 'to'-infinitive clause.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>...small beaches of sand</i> <b>so</b> <i>white</i> <b>as to dazzle the eye</b>.</li>
	<li><i>I hope that nobody was</i> <b>so</b> <i>stupid</i> <b>as to go around saying those things</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p class="clgm_hw">8.59</p>
<p>'So' and 'that' can also be used in this way with 'many', 'few', 'much', and 'little'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>We found</i> <b>so much</b> <i>to talk about</i> <b>that it was late at night when we remembered the time</b>.</li>
	<li><i>There were</i> <b>so many children</b> <b>you could hardly squeeze in the room</b>.</li>
</ul>
