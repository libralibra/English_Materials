<p class="subTitle">7.60 referring to places</p>
<p>You may need to change words which relate to position or place.</p>
<p>For example, if you are talking to a man about a restaurant, he might say 'I go there every day'. If you report his statement while you are actually in the restaurant, you could say 'He said he comes here every day'.</p>
