<p class="subTitle">1.39 used with delexical verbs</p>
<p>There are some activities which you do not usually do more than once at a time. The nouns that refer to them are usually the object of a verb, and are used with the determiner 'a'.</p>
<p>In this structure the verb has very little meaning and the noun carries most of the meaning of the whole structure. The verbs in such structures are called <b>delexical verbs</b>. For more information about these, see paragraphs <b>3.33 to 3.46</b>.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>I went and had</i> <b>a wash</b>.</li>
	<li><i>Bruno gave it</i> <b>a try</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some singular nouns are used so regularly with a particular verb that they have become fixed phrases and are idiomatic.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>I'd like very much for you to</i> <b>have a voice</b> <i>in the decision</i>.</li>
	<li><i>Isn't it time we</i> <b>made a move?</b></li>
</ul>
