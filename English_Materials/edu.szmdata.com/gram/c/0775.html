<p class="subTitle">4.207 wishes: 'would'</p>
<p>You can say what someone wants by using 'would' followed by a verb meaning 'to like'. After the verb meaning 'to like' you put a 'to'-infinitive clause or a noun group.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>I</i> <b>would</b> <i>like to know the date</i>.</li>
	<li><i>I</i> <b>would</b> <i>prefer to say nothing about this problem</i>.</li>
	<li><i>We</i><b>'d</b> <i>like to keep you here</i>.</li>
	<li><i>Oh, I hope it will be twins. I</i><b>'d</b> <i>love twins</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p class="clgm_hw">4.208</p>
<p>You can say what someone does not want by using 'would not'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>I</i> <b>would not</b> <i>like to see it</i>.</li>
	<li><i>We</i> <b>wouldn't</b> <i>like to lose you</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Normally, when you are using 'would' with 'like' to say what someone does not want, you put 'not' after 'would'. If you put 'not' after 'like', you change the meaning slightly.</p>
<p>For example, if you say 'I would not like to be a student', you mean you are not a student and do not want to be one. But if you say 'I would like not to be a student', you mean you are a student and do not want to be one.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>All of us</i> <b>would like not</b> <i>to have nuclear weapons</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also say what someone does not want by using 'would' with a verb meaning 'to dislike'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>I</i> <b>would</b> <i>hate to move to another house now</i>.</li>
	<li><i>Personally, I</i> <b>would</b> <i>loathe to be dragged into this dispute</i>.</li>
</ul>
