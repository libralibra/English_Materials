<p class="subTitle">5.111 Subordinate time clauses</p>
<p>Subordinate time clauses can often be used instead of prepositional phrases to indicate when an event occurs.</p>
<p>For example, instead of saying 'He was killed in a car accident four years after their marriage', you could say 'He was killed in a car accident four years after they were married'.</p>
<p>Or, instead of saying 'During his stay in prison, he has written many essays and poems', you could say 'While he has been in prison, he has written many essays and poems'.</p>
<p>It is often possible or preferable to use a subordinate clause introduced by 'before' or 'after' to indicate the order or simultaneity of a number of events.</p>
<p>Subordinate time clauses are explained in paragraphs <b>8.8 to 8.24</b>.</p>
