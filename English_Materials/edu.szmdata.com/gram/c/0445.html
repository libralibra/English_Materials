<p class="subTitle">3.20 transitive verbs which need an adjunct</p>
<p>With some transitive verbs, you have to give additional information about what is going on by using an <b>adjunct</b> after the object of the verb.</p>

<ul>
	<li><i>The judge</i> <b>based</b> <i>his decision</i> <b>on constitutional rights</b>.</li>
	<li><i>He</i> <b>had subjected</b> <i>me</i> <b>to the pressure of financial ruin</b>.</li>
	<li><i>Mr. Claude Cheysoon</i> <b>regards</b> <i>the third world</i> <b>as his top priority</b>.</li>

<ul>
	<li class="c_list"><b>regard as, view as,  --- , mistake for, swap for,  --- , dissociate from, prevent from,  --- , deprive of, remind of, rid of, rob of,  --- , accustom to, attribute to, ascribe to, compare to, condemn to, confine to, consign to, dedicate to, entitle to, liken to, owe to, return to, subject to, subordinate to,  --- , acquaint with, associate with, confront with, engrave with, pelt with, ply with, trust with</b></li>
