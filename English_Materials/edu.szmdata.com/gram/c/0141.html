<p class="subTitle">1.162 The specific way: using 'the'</p>
<p>'The' is the commonest specific determiner; it is sometimes called the <b>definite article</b>.</p>
<p>'This', 'that', 'these', and 'those' are often called <b>demonstratives</b> or <b>demonstrative adjectives</b>. For more information on these, see paragraphs <b>1.182 to 1.191</b>.</p>
<p>'My', 'your', 'his', 'her', 'its', 'our' and 'their' are <b>possessive determiners</b>. They are also sometimes called <b>possessive adjectives</b> or just <b>possessives</b>. For more information about these, see paragraphs <b>1.192 to 1.207</b>.</p>
<p>Here is the list of specific determiners:</p>
<ul>
	<li class="c_list"><b>the,  --- , this, that, these, those,  --- , my, your, his, her, its, our, their</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Note that in English you cannot use more than one specific determiner before a noun.</p>
<p class="clgm_hw">1.163</p>
<p>Because 'the' is the commonest specific determiner, you can put 'the' in front of any common noun.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>She dropped</i> <b>the can</b> <i>into</i> <b>the grass</b>.</li>
	<li><b>The girls</b> <i>were not in</i> <b>the house</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>In these examples, the use of 'the can' means that a can has already been mentioned; 'the grass' is probably definite because it has already been stated that 'she' is outside, and the presence of grass may also have been stated or is presumed; 'the girls', like 'the can', must have been mentioned before, and 'the house' means the one where the girls were staying at the time.</p>
