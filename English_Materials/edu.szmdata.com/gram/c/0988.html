<p>The common adverbs of place, such as 'in' and 'up', which are used as adverbs and as prepositions are sometimes called <b>adverb particles</b> or <b>adverbial particles</b>. The following list of words are used as adverbs to indicate position, and they can also be used as prepositions:</p>

<p class="clgm_hw">6.84</p>
<p>An adverb can be used as an adjunct if the adverb itself makes it clear what place or direction you mean.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>The young men hated working</i> <b>underground</b>.</li>
	<li><i>The engine droned on as we flew</i> <b>northward</b>.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><i>We went to the bottom of the field where a wagon stood half-loaded. We crawled</i> <b>underneath</b>, <i>between the wheels</i>.</li>
