<p class="subTitle">7.37 USAGE NOTE</p>
<p>A few verbs can be used with a 'to'-infinitive clause to report requests when the hearer is mentioned in a prepositional phrase.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>An officer shouted</i> <b>to us</b> <i>to stop all the noise</i>.</li>
	<li><i>I pleaded</i> <b>with him</b> <i>to tell me</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is a list of these verbs and the prepositions used with them:</p>
<ul>
	<li class="c_list"><b>appeal to, plead with, shout at, shout to, whisper to, yell at</b></li>
</ul>
<p class="clgm_hw">7.38</p>
<p>In ordinary conversation, requests are often put in the form of a question. For example, you might say 'Will you help me?' instead of 'Help me'. Similarly, reported requests often look like reported questions.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>People ask me if I can lend them fifty dollars</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>When you report a request like this, you can mention both the person receiving it and the person making it.</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>He</b> <i>asked</i> <b>me</b> <i>whether I would help him</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Alternatively, you can just mention the person making it.</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>He</b> <i>asked if I would answer some questions</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p class="clgm_hw">7.39</p>
<p>You can report a request in which someone asks if they can do something by using a 'to'-infinitive clause after 'ask' or 'demand'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>I asked to see the manager</i>.</li>
</ul>
