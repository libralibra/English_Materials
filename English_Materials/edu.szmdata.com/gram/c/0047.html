<p class="subTitle">1.49 singular or plural verb</p>
<p>When you use a collective noun, you can use either a singular verb or a plural verb after it.</p>
<p>You choose a singular verb if you think of the group as a single unit, and a plural verb if you think of the group as a number of individuals.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>Our little</i> <b>group is</b> <i>complete again</i>.</li>
	<li><i>A second</i> <b>group are</b> <i>those parents who feel that they were too harsh</i>.</li>
	<li><i>Our</i> <b>family isn't</b> <i>poor any more</i>.</li>
	<li><i>My</i> <b>family are</b> <i>perfectly normal</i>.</li>
	<li><i>I like to know what</i> <b>the enemy is thinking</b>.</li>
	<li><b>The enemy were</b> <i>visibly</i> <b>cracking</b>.</li>
	<li><i>His arguments were confined to books which</i> <b>the public was</b> <i>unlikely to read</i>.</li>
	<li><b>The public were deceived</b> <i>by the newspapers</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The names of many organizations are collective nouns, and can be used with a singular or a plural verb.</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>The BBC is sending</b> <i>him to Tuscany for the summer</i>.</li>
	<li><b>The BBC are planning</b> <i>to use the new satellite next month</i>.</li>
	<li><b>England are seeking</b> <i>alternatives for their B team</i>.</li>
	<li><b>England was leading</b> <i>18-0 at half-time</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to refer back to a collective noun, you choose a singular pronoun or determiner if the previous verb is singular, and a plural pronoun if the previous verb is plural.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>The government</i> <b>has said</b> <b>it</b> <i>would wish to do this only if there was no alternative</i>.</li>
	<li><i>The government</i> <b>have made up</b> <b>their</b> <i>minds that</i> <b>they</b><i>'re going to win</i>.</li>
</ul>
