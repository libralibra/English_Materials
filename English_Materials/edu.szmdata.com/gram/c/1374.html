<p class="subTitle">10.107 showing your reactions</p>
<p>There are various ways of showing your reaction to something that you are experiencing or looking at, or that you have just been told. One way is to use an exclamation such as 'bother', 'good heavens', 'oh dear', or 'ouch'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Ow!</b> <i>That hurt</i>.</li>
	<li><i>'Margaret Ravenscroft may have been responsible for her sister's death.' --- '</i><b>Good heavens!'</b> <i>said Dr Willoughby</i>.</li>
	<li><i>'She died last autumn.' --- '</i><b>Oh dear</b>, <i>I'm so sorry.'</i></li>
</ul>
<p>Some exclamations are only used to show reactions. Here is a list of some common ones:</p>
<ul>
	<li class="c_list"><b>aha, blast, blimey, bother, bravo, crikey, damn, good gracious, good grief, good heavens, good lord, goodness me, gosh, honestly, hurray, oh, oh dear, ooh, oops, ouch, ow, really, ugh, well I never, what, whoops, wow, yippee, you're joking, yuk</b></li>
