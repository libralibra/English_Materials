<p class="subTitle">6.4 noun groups</p>
<p>Occasionally, <b>noun groups</b> can also be used as adjuncts.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>He was looking really ill</i> <b>this time yesterday</b>.</li>
	<li><i>'There's a massive market</i> <b>that side of the water,'</b> <i>he says, gesturing out of his window</i>.</li>
	<li><i>I'm going to handle this</i> <b>my way</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>When noun groups are used as adjuncts, they are most often adjuncts of time, which are dealt with in Chapter 5. Noun groups as adjuncts of place are dealt with at paragraph <b>6.101</b>, as adjuncts of manner at paragraph <b>6.44</b>, and as adjuncts of degree at paragraph <b>6.52</b>.</p>
