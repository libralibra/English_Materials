<p class="subTitle">8.73 Place clauses</p>
<p>Sometimes, when you want to talk about the location or position of something, you need to use a clause rather than a simple adjunct. The kind of clause you use is called a <b>place clause</b>.</p>
<p class="clgm_hw">8.74</p>
<p>Place clauses usually begin with 'where'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>He said he was happy</i> <b>where</b> <i>he was</i>.</li>
	<li><i>He left it</i> <b>where</b> <i>it lay</i>.</li>
	<li><i>...an official policy which encouraged people to stay</i> <b>where</b> <i>they were</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>'Where' is also used in <b>relative clauses</b>. This use is explained in paragraphs <b>8.104 to 8.106</b>.</p>
<p class="clgm_hw">8.75</p>
<p>In formal or literary English, 'where'-clauses are sometimes put in front of a main clause.</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Where</b> <i>Kate had stood last night, Maureen now stood</i>.</li>
	<li><b>Where</b> <i>the pink cliffs rose out of the ground there were often narrow tracks winding upwards</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p class="clgm_hw">8.76</p>
<p>When you want to say that something happens or will happen in every place where something else happens, you use 'wherever'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>Soft-stemmed herbs and ferns spread across the ground</i> <b>wherever</b> <i>there was enough light</i>.</li>
	<li><i>In Bali</i>, <b>wherever</b> <i>you go, you come across ceremonies</i>.</li>
	<li><b>Wherever</b> <i>I looked, I found patterns</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>'Everywhere' can be used instead of 'wherever'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Everywhere</b> <i>I went, people were angry or suspicious</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p class="clgm_hw">8.77</p>
<p>'Where' and 'wherever' are sometimes used in front of adjectives such as 'possible' and 'necessary'. When they are used like this, they mean 'when' or 'whenever', rather than 'where'. For a full explanation of this use, see paragraph <b>8.24</b>.</p>
