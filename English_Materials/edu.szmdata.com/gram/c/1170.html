<p class="subTitle">8.123 present participle: reasons</p>
<p>If you want to explain why someone does something or why something happens, you say what happens in the main clause and give the reason in a clause containing a present participle.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>At one point I made up my mind to go and talk to Uncle Sam. Then I changed my mind</i>, <b>realising that he could do nothing to help</b>.</li>
	<li><i>The baby would probably not live to grow up</i>, <b>being a scrawny little thing, unlikely to survive the normal ailments of childhood</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p class="clgm_hw">8.124</p>
<p>You can also use a present participle directly after a verb in a sentence such as 'I stood shivering at the roadside'. This use is explained in paragraphs <b>3.190 to 3.203</b>.</p>
