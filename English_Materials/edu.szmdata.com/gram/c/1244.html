<p class="subTitle">9.26 'so' and 'not' with report verbs</p>
<p>'So' and 'not' are also used to substitute for clauses after some common report verbs. They are also used after the expression 'I'm afraid', which is used to report an unwelcome fact.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>'Are you all right?' --- 'I think</i> <b>so.'</b></li>
	<li><i>You're a sensible woman --- I've always said</i> <b>so</b>.</li>
	<li><i>'You think he's dead, don't you?' --- 'I'm afraid</i> <b>so</b>, <i>Sally.'</i></li>
	<li><i>'It doesn't often happen.' --- 'No, I suppose</i> <b>not.'</b></li>
	<li><i>'You haven't lost the ticket, have you?' --- 'I hope</i> <b>not.'</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Here is a list of report verbs which can be followed by 'so' and 'not':</p>
<ul>
	<li class="c_list"><b>believe, expect, hope, say, suppose, tell, think</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Note that the use of 'not' as a substitute with 'think', 'expect', and 'believe' is rare or formal. Also, 'not' is not used with 'tell', and when it is occasionally used with 'say', there is a modal in front of 'say'.</p>
<p>Occasionally 'so' is put at the beginning of the clause. This often has the effect of casting doubt on the truth of the fact involved.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>Everybody in the world</i>, <b>so</b> <i>they say, has a double</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>'So' can also be used at the beginning of a clause for emphasis. This is explained in paragraph <b>10.85</b>.</p>
