<p class="subTitle">2.124 superlatives as headwords</p>
<p>Superlative adjectives are sometimes used as headwords in fairly formal English. When you use a superlative adjective as a headword, you put 'the' in front of it, and follow it with 'of' and a noun group which refers to the things being compared. When superlative adjectives are used as headwords they can refer to one thing or to more than one.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>They are often too poor to buy or rent even</i> <b>the cheapest</b> <i>of houses</i>.</li>
	<li><i>He made several important discoveries</i>. <b>The most interesting</b> <i>of these came from an examination of an old manuscript</i>.</li>
	<li><i>There are three types of ant-eater</i>. <b>The smallest</b> <i>lives entirely in trees</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>If it is clear what you are talking about, you can omit 'of' and the following noun group.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>The oldest memories always last</i> <b>the longest</b>.</li>
</ul>
