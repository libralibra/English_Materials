<p class="subTitle">2.277 approximate age</p>
<p>When you want to talk about a person's age in an approximate way, you can do so by using</p>
<p>*  'in', followed by a possessive determiner, followed by a plural noun referring to a particular range of years such as 'twenties' and 'teens'</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>He was</i> <b>in his sixties</b>.</li>
	<li><i>I didn't mature till I was</i> <b>in my forties</b>.</li>
	<li><i>...the groups who are now</i> <b>in their thirties</b>.</li>
	<li><i>...when I was</i> <b>in my teens</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that you can use 'early', 'mid-', 'middle', or 'late' to indicate approximately where someone's age comes in a particular range years.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>He was then</i> <b>in his late seventies</b>.</li>
	<li><i>She was</i> <b>in her mid-twenties</b>.</li>
	<li><i>Jane is only</i> <b>in her early forties</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p> *  'over' or 'under' followed by a number</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>She was well</i> <b>over fifty</b>.</li>
	<li><i>She was only a little</i> <b>over forty years old</b>.</li>
	<li><i>There weren't enough people who were</i> <b>under 25</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that you can also use 'above' or 'below' followed by 'the age of' and a number.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>55 per cent of them were</i> <b>below the age of twenty-one</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p> *  a compound noun indicating a group of people whose age is more or less than a particular number, which consists of 'over' or 'under' followed by the plural form of the particular number</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>The</i> <b>over-sixties</b> <i>do not want to be turned out of their homes</i>.</li>
	<li><i>Schooling for</i> <b>under-fives</b> <i>should be expanded</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p class="clgm_hw">2.278</p>
<p>You can put several of the above structures after a noun to indicate the age of a person or thing.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>...a woman</i> <b>in her early thirties</b>.</li>
	<li><i>...help for elderly ladies</i> <b>over 65</b>.</li>
	<li><i>She had four children</i> <b>under the age of five</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p class="clgm_hw">2.279</p>
<p>If you want to indicate that someone's age is similar to someone else's age, you can use structures such as 'of his age' and 'of her parents' age' after a noun. The 'of' is often dropped.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>In France most folk</i> <b>of Mike's age</b> <i>are doing their National Service</i>.</li>

</ul>
