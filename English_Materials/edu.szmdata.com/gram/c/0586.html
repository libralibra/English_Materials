<p class="subTitle">3.212 causative use of 'have' and 'get'</p>
<p>A special use of 'have' in phase structures is to say that the subject causes something to be dealt with by someone else. In this case, 'have' is followed by an object referring to the thing dealt with, and then by the past participle of a transitive verb or of an intransitive verb followed by a preposition.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>He went to</i> <b>have a cavity filled</b> <i>and had an injection</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>This structure is also used to say that something belonging to the subject of 'have' is affected in some way.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>She'd just lost her job and</i> <b>had some money stolen</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to mention the performer of the second action, you use 'by' followed by a noun group.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>Gary Jones twice had his face trampled on</i> <b>by Butts</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>'Get' can also be used with an object and a past participle to talk about causing something to be dealt with or affected in some way.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>We must</i> <b>get the car repaired</b>.</li>
	<li><i>One of these days I am going to</i> <b>get myself elected</b> <i>to Parliament</i>.</li>
</ul>
