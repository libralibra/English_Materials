<p class="subTitle">4.213 regret: 'would that'</p>
<p>In very old-fashioned English, 'would' is used without a subject to express a wish that a situation might be different, or to express regret that something did not happen in the past. 'Would' is followed by a 'that'-clause.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>'Are they better off now than they were two years ago?' --- '</i><b>Would that</b> <i>they were.'</i></li>
	<li><b>Would that</b> <i>the developments had been so easy</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>When 'I' is the subject of the 'that'-clause, the verb is usually 'were'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>Would that I</i> <b>were</b> <i>young again, and she were in my arms</i>.</li>
</ul>
