<p class="subTitle">3.186 verb forms</p>
<p>The first verb involved in a phase structure is the main verb of the structure. It is usually <b>finite</b>, that is, it inflects for tense and agrees in number with the subject of the clause.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>I</i> <b>wanted</b> <i>to come home</i>.</li>
	<li><i>Lonnie</i> <b>wants</b> <i>to say 'sorry'</i>.</li>
	<li><i>More and more people</i> <b>are coming</b> <i>to appreciate the contribution which Muslims make to our society</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, it can be a <b>non-finite</b> form.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>There is a tendency for teachers</i> <b>to advise</b> <i>people to take their best school subjects at A Level</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p class="clgm_hw">3.187</p>
<p>The second verb in the combination is always <b>non-finite</b>, which means that it does not inflect for tense and or change its form at all.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>Castle tried</i> <b>to read</b>.</li>
	<li><i>They had been trying</i> <b>to read</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p class="clgm_hw">3.188</p>
<p>There are four types of non-finite verb forms that are used for the second verb in phase:</p>
<p>*  the present participle</p>
<p>*  the 'to'-infinitive form</p>
<p>*  the infinitive without 'to'</p>
<p>*  the past participle</p>
<p>Note that the infinitive without 'to' and the past participle form of the verb are used in only a few combinations.</p>
<p>Other kinds of '-ing' form and infinitive are also sometimes used. They are combinations of non-finite forms.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>Those very close to the blast risk</i> <b>being burnt</b>.</li>
	<li><i>Neither Rita nor I recalled ever</i> <b>having seen</b> <i>her</i>.</li>
	<li><i>She wanted</i> <b>to be reassured</b>.</li>
	<li><i>They claimed</i> <b>to have shot down</b> <i>22 planes</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p class="clgm_hw">3.189</p>
<p>The position of 'not' in negative phase structures is explained in paragraphs <b>4.53 to 4.54</b>.</p>
