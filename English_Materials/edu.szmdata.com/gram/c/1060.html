<p class="subTitle">7.48 reporting verb in other tenses</p>
<p>If you are reporting something that someone says or believes at the time that you are speaking, you use a present tense of the reporting verb.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>Experts</i> <b>say</b> <i>that you should be precise in your accounting</i>.</li>
	<li><i>I</i> <b>think</b> <i>it's going to rain</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, you can also use a present tense of the reporting verb when you are reporting something said in the past, especially if you are reporting something that someone often says or that is still true.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>She</i> <b>says</b> <i>she wants to see you this afternoon</i>.</li>
	<li><i>My doctor</i> <b>says</b> <i>it's nothing to worry about</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are predicting what people will say or think, you use a future tense of the reporting verb.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>No doubt he</i> <b>will claim</b> <i>that his car broke down</i>.</li>
	<li><i>They</i> <b>will think</b> <i>we are making a fuss</i>.</li>
</ul>
