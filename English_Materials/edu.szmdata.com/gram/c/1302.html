<p class="subTitle">10.28 'what' or 'all' to focus on an action</p>
<p>If you want to focus on an action performed by someone, you can use a cleft sentence consisting of 'what' followed by the subject, the verb 'do', the verb 'be', and an <b>infinitive</b> clause with or without 'to'.</p>
<p>For example, instead of saying 'I wrote to George immediately', you can say 'What I did was to write to George immediately'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>What Stephen did was to interview a lot of old people</i>.</li>
	<li><i>What you have to do is to choose five companies to invest in</i>.</li>
	<li><i>What it does is draw out all the vitamins from the body</i>.</li>
	<li><i>What he did was get Christopher followed by a private detective</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can use 'all' instead of 'what' if you want to emphasize that just one thing is done and nothing else.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>All he did was shake hands and wish me good luck</i>.</li>
	<li><i>All she ever does is make jam</i>.</li>
</ul>
