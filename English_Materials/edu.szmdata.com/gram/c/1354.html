<p class="subTitle">10.85 Emphasizing</p>
<p>You may want to emphasize the truth of your statement or to stress the seriousness of the situation you are describing. You can do this using the following sentence adjuncts:</p>
<p><b>above all, actually, at all, believe me, by all means, even, for heaven's sake, indeed, positively, really, simply, so, surely, to put it mildly, to say the least, truly, without exception</b></p>
<ul>
	<li><i>Sometimes we</i> <b>actually</b> <i>dared to penetrate their territory</i>.</li>
	<li><b>Above all</b>, <i>do not be too proud to ask for advice</i>.</li>
	<li><i>Eight years was</i> <b>indeed</b> <i>a short span of time</i>.</li>
	<li><i>I</i> <b>really</b> <i>am sorry</i>.</li>
	<li><b>Believe me</b>, <i>if you get robbed, the best thing to do is forget about it</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that 'indeed' is often used after complements containing 'very'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>I think she is a</i> <b>very</b> <i>stupid person</i> <b>indeed</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>'At all' is used for emphasis in negative clauses, usually at the end.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>I didn't like it</i> <b>at all</b>.</li>
	<li><i>I would not be</i> <b>at all</b> <i>surprised if they turned out to be the same person</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>'Surely' is used when you are appealing for agreement.</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Surely</b> <i>it is better to know the truth than to be deluded</i>.</li>
	<li><i>Here</i>, <b>surely</b>, <i>is a case for treating people as individuals</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>'Even' is placed in front of a word or group to draw attention to a surprising part of what you are saying.</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Even</b> <i>at mid-day the air was sharp and chilly</i>.</li>
	<li><i>Some men were</i> <b>even</b> <i>singing</i>.</li>
	<li><i>There was no one in the cafe, not</i> <b>even</b> <i>a waiter</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>'So' is used as an emphatic introduction when agreeing or commenting.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>'Derek! It's raining!' --- '</i><b>So</b> <i>it is.'</i></li>
	<li><i>'He's very grateful!' --- '</i><b>So</b> <i>he ought to be.'</i></li>
</ul>
<p>'By all means' is used for emphasis when giving permission.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>If your baby likes water</i>, <b>by all means</b> <i>give it to him</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>'For heaven's sake' is used when making a request or asking a question.</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>For heaven's sake</b>, <i>don't pull, Chris</i>.</li>
	<li><i>What are you staring at</i>, <b>for heaven's sake?</b></li>
</ul>
