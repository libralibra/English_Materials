<p class="subTitle">4.179 offers and invitations: 'would' and 'wouldn't'</p>
<p>A more polite way of offering something or making an invitation is to use 'would' with a verb which means 'to like'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Would</b> <i>you like a drink?</i></li>
	<li><b>Would</b> <i>you care to stay with us?</i></li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to sound more persuasive without seeming impolite or insistent, you can use 'wouldn't' instead of 'would'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Wouldn't</b> <i>you like to come with me?</i></li>
	<li><b>Wouldn't</b> <i>you care for some more coffee?</i></li>
</ul>
