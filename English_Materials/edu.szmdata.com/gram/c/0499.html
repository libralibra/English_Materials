<p class="subTitle">3.102 object position</p>
<p>When you are using a phrasal verb in a transitive clause and the object is a short noun group, you usually have a choice as to where you put the object. It can be placed either after the second word of the phrasal verb or after the first word and before the second word.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>I</i> <b>filled up</b> <i>a jar with potassium permanganate</i>.</li>
	<li><i>She</i> <b>filled</b> <i>my glass</i> <b>up</b>.</li>
	<li><i>He</i> <b>handed over</b> <i>the box</i>.</li>
	<li><i>Mrs Kaul</i> <b>handed</b> <i>the flowers</i> <b>over</b> <i>to Judy</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p class="clgm_hw">3.103</p>
<p>However, when the object consists of a long noun group, it is more likely to come after the second word of the phrasal verb, so that the two parts of the phrasal verb are not separated too widely. In this way, attention is focused on the information contained in the noun group, rather than on the second word of the phrasal verb.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>The authorities have</i> <b>turned down</b> <i>a request by the Argentine Embassy to examine the wreckage of the plane</i>.</li>
</ul>
