<p class="subTitle">10.1 Introduction</p>
<p>The position of the elements of clause structure in a statement usually follows the sequence 'subject, verb, object, complement, adjunct'. The subject, which is what you are going to talk about, comes first. If you want to express yourself normally and not draw special attention to any part of the clause, then you follow this sequence.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>Donald was lying on the bed</i>.</li>
	<li><i>She has brought the tape with her</i>.</li>
	<li><i>He wiped the glass dry with a tea-towel</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The examples above are in the <b>declarative mood</b>. Chapter 4 explains the mood system in English and shows how other meanings can be expressed using the <b>interrogative</b> and <b>imperative</b> moods. These other moods involve regular changes in the sequence of elements in the clause.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>Is he ill?</i></li>
	<li><i>Put it on the table</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p class="clgm_hw">10.2</p>
<p>However, there are other ways of putting the elements of clause structure in a different sequence, in order to give special emphasis or meaning to the clause or a part of it.</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>In his enthusiasm</b>, <i>Captain Cheshire had hoped to raise the money this year</i>.</li>
	<li><b>The third sheet</b> <i>he folded and placed in his pocket</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>This applies mainly to <b>main clauses</b>. This Chapter shows how you can vary the order of the clause elements in a main clause when you want to give special force to the whole clause or to one of its elements.</p>
<p>In most <b>subordinate clauses</b>, you have no choice about the order of the clause elements.</p>
