<p class="subTitle">3.166 verbs of opinion</p>
<p>Some transitive verbs with the general meaning 'consider' can be used with an adjective or noun group as complement to say what someone's opinion of a person or thing is.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>They</i> <b>consider him an embarrassment</b>.</li>
	<li><i>Do you</i> <b>find his view of America interesting?</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Here is a list of these verbs:</p>
<ul>
	<li class="c_list"><b>account, believe, consider, find, hold, judge, presume, reckon, think</b></li>
</ul>
<p>'Prove' can also have an adjective or a noun group as a complement, although it means 'show' not 'consider'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>He had</i> <b>proved them all wrong</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p class="clgm_hw">3.167</p>
<p>These verbs are often used in the passive. 'Believe', 'presume', 'reckon', and 'think' are nearly always used in the passive in these structures.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>In many ways the gathering</i> <b>could be considered successful</b>.</li>
	<li><i>30 bombers</i> <b>were believed shot down</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p class="clgm_hw">3.168</p>
<p>All the verbs listed in paragraph <b>3.166</b> except 'account' can also be used with a 'to'-infinitive clause after their object indicating what someone thinks a person or thing is like or does.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>She had always considered George Garforth</i> <b>to be a very presentable young man</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>See paragraph <b>3.207</b> for information using a 'to'-infinitive clause after the object of these verbs.</p>
<p class="clgm_hw">3.169</p>
<p>You can use these verbs with 'it' as their object followed by a complement and a 'to'-infinitive clause to show someone's opinion of an action. For example, instead of saying 'She found breathing difficult', you can say 'She found it difficult to breathe'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>Gretchen found</i> <b>it</b> <i>difficult</i> <b>to speak</b>.</li>
	<li><i>He thought</i> <b>it</b> <i>right</i> <b>to resign</b>.</li>
	<li><i>He considered</i> <b>it</b> <i>his duty</i> <b>to go</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are examples of 'it' being used in an <b>impersonal</b> way. For more information about the impersonal use of 'it', see paragraphs <b>10.31 to 10.45</b>.</p>
