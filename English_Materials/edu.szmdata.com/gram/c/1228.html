<p class="subTitle">9.10 demonstratives referring to sentences</p>
<p>Demonstratives can also be pronouns or determiners which refer back to an entire sentence or a number of sentences.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>'You're the new doctor, aren't you?' --- '</i><b>That</b><i>'s right.'</i></li>
	<li><i>'Were you worried about the disrespect for the law exhibited by your two heroes?' --- '</i><b>That</b><i>'s a hard question to answer.'</i></li>
	<li><i>'I'll think about it, Mother.'</i> <b>That</b> <i>statement was the end of most of their discussions</i>.</li>
	<li><i>I accept neither of</i> <b>these</b> <i>arguments</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that when 'these' and 'those' are pronouns referring back to an entire statement they are only used in front of the verb 'be'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>It was hard for me to believe</i> <b>these</b> <i>were his real reasons for wanting to get rid of me</i>.</li>
	<li><i>I put my arms around her. 'Thanks, Ollie.'</i> <b>Those</b> <i>were her last words</i>.</li>
</ul>
