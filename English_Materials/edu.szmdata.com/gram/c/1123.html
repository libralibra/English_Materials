<p class="subTitle">8.45 non-finite clauses</p>
<p><b>Non-finite purpose clauses</b> usually begin with 'in order to' or 'so as to'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>They were shoving each other out of the way</i> <b>in order to</b> <i>get to the front</i>.</li>
	<li><i>They have tried to limit such imports</i> <b>in order to</b> <i>protect their members' jobs</i>.</li>
	<li><i>The best thing to do is to fix up a screen</i> <b>so as to</b> <i>let in the fresh air and keep out the flies</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to make one of these clauses negative, you put 'not' in front of the 'to'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>Rose trod with care</i> <b>in order not to</b> <i>spread the dirt</i>.</li>
	<li><i>When removing a stain, work from the edge inwards</i> <b>so as not to</b> <i>enlarge the area affected</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p class="clgm_hw">8.46</p>
<p>Non-finite purpose clauses can simply be 'to'-infinitive clauses.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>People would stroll down the path</i> <b>to</b> <i>admire the garden</i>.</li>
	<li><i>The children sleep together</i> <b>to</b> <i>keep warm</i>.</li>
	<li><b>To</b> <i>understand what is happening now, we need to reflect on what has been achieved in the last decade</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, you cannot use a negative with one of these structures. You cannot say, for example, 'We keep the window shut not to let the flies in'. You would have to say, 'We keep the window shut in order not to let the flies in'.</p>
