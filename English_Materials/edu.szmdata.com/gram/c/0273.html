<p class="subTitle">2.111 qualifiers after comparatives</p>
<p>Comparatives are often followed by 'than' when you want to specify what the other thing involved in the comparison is. You say exactly what you are comparing by using one of a number of structures after 'than'. These structures can be</p>
<p>*  noun groups</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>Charlie was</i> <b>more honest than his predecessor</b>.</li>
	<li><i>...an area</i> <b>bigger than Great Britain</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that when 'than' is followed by a pronoun on its own, the pronoun must be an object pronoun such as 'me', 'him', or 'her'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>My brother is</i> <b>younger than me</b>.</li>
	<li><i>Lamin was</i> <b>shorter than her</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p> *  adjuncts</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>The changes will be even</i> <b>more striking</b> <i>in the case of teaching</i> <b>than in medicine</b>.</li>
	<li><i>Last year, terrorist activities were</i> <b>worse than in any of the previous twelve years</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p> *  clauses</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>I would have done a</i> <b>better</b> <i>job</i> <b>than he did</b>.</li>
	<li><i>I was a</i> <b>better</b> <i>writer</i> <b>than he was</b>.</li>
	<li><i>He's</i> <b>taller than I am</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that when a comparative is not followed by a 'than' phrase, the other thing in the comparison should be obvious. For example, if someone says 'Could I have a bigger one, please ?' they are likely to be holding the item which they think is too small.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>A mattress would be</i> <b>better</b>.</li>
</ul>
