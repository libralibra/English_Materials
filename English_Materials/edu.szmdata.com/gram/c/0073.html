<p class="subTitle">1.76 '-man' and '-person'</p>
<p>Words ending in '-man' are either used to refer only to men or to both men and women. For example, a 'postman' is a man, but a 'spokesman' can be a man or a woman.</p>
<p>Some people now use words ending in '-person', such as 'chairperson' and 'spokesperson', instead of words ending in '-man', in order to avoid appearing to refer specifically to a man.</p>
