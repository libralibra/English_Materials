<p class="subTitle">8.127 mentioning the subject</p>
<p>Sometimes you want to use a non-defining clause which has a different subject from the subject of the main clause. These clauses are explained in the following paragraphs <b>8.128 to 8.131</b>.</p>
<p class="clgm_hw">8.128</p>
<p>In this kind of non-defining clause, you usually have to mention the subject.</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Ashton being dead</b>, <i>the whole affair must now be laid before Colonel Browne</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, if the non-defining clause comes after the main clause, and it is clear from the context that it relates to the object of the main clause, you do not need to mention the object again.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>They picked me up</i>, <b>kicking and bawling</b>, <i>and carried me up to the road</i>.</li>
</ul>

	</body>
