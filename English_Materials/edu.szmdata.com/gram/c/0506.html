<p class="subTitle">3.112 intransitive three-word phrasal verbs</p>
<p>Most phrasal verbs consist of two words: a verb and an adverb, or a verb and a preposition. However, there are a number of phrasal verbs which consist of three words: a verb, an adverb, and a preposition.</p>
<p>Most three-word phrasal verbs contain an intransitive verb. The preposition at the end is followed by its own object.</p>
