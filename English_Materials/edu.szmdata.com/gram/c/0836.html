<p class="subTitle">5.30 habitual and regular actions</p>
<p>If you want to talk about an activity that took place regularly or repeatedly in the past, but which no longer occurs, you use the simple past.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>We</i> <b>walked</b> <i>a great deal in my boyhood</i>.</li>
	<li><i>Each week we</i> <b>trekked</b> <i>to the big house</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>'Would' and 'used to' can also be used to say that something happened regularly in the past but no longer does so. See paragraphs <b>4.115</b> and <b>4.259</b> for more information.</p>
