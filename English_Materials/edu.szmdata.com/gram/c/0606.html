<p class="subTitle">4.21 questions without a verb</p>
<p>In conversation, a 'wh'-question sometimes consists of a 'wh'-word on its own. For example, if you say to someone 'I'm learning to type', they might say 'Why?', meaning 'Why are you learning to type?'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>'He saw a snake.' --- '</i><b>Where</b><i>?'</i></li>
	<li><i>'I have to go to Germany.' --- '</i><b>When</b><i>?'</i></li>
	<li><i>'I knew you were landing today.' --- '</i><b>How</b><i>?'</i></li>
</ul>
<p>A 'wh'-question can also consist of a noun group containing a 'wh'-word. For example, if you say to someone 'I gave your book to that girl', they might say 'Which girl?', meaning 'Which girl did you give my book to?'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>'He knew my cousin.' --- '</i><b>Which cousin</b><i>?'</i></li>
	<li><i>'Who was your friend?' --- '</i><b>What friend</b><i>?'</i></li>
</ul>
