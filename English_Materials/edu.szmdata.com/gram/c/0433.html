<p class="subTitle">3.4 transitive verbs</p>
<p>If the action or event involves another person or thing which the action affects, relates to, or produces, you put a noun group referring to them after the verb group. This is called the <b>object</b> of the verb or clause. If it is necessary to distinguish it from other objects, it is called the <b>direct object</b>.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>He closed</i> <b>the door</b>.</li>
	<li><i>I hate</i> <b>sport</b>.</li>
	<li><i>Some of the women noticed</i> <b>me</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Clauses which have a direct object are called <b>transitive clauses</b>, and verbs which occur in transitive clauses are called <b>transitive verbs</b>. Transitive verbs are explained in paragraphs <b>3.15 to 3.26</b>.</p>
<p><b>Reflexive verbs</b> and <b>delexical verbs</b> are special kinds of transitive verbs. They are explained in paragraphs <b>3.27 to 3.32</b>and <b>3.33</b> to <b>3.46</b>.</p>
