<p class="subTitle">2.95 '-ed' adjectives formed from nouns</p>
<p>Here is a list of '-ed' adjectives formed from nouns:</p>
<ul>
	<li class="c_list"><b>armoured, barbed, beaded, bearded, flowered, freckled, gifted, gloved, hooded, mannered, pointed, principled, salaried, skilled, spotted, striped, turbaned, walled, winged</b></li>
</ul>
<p>'-ed' adjectives formed from nouns are commonly used as the second part of <b>compound adjectives</b> (see paragraph <b>2.98</b> to <b>2.107</b>) such as 'grey-haired' and 'open-minded', because we often want to describe the feature that someone or something has.</p>
