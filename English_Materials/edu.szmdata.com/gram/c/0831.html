<p class="subTitle">5.24 frequent actions</p>
<p>The present continuous is also used with adjuncts of frequency when you want to emphasize how often the action takes place. This is often done to express disapproval or annoyance. The adjunct of frequency is placed after the auxiliary verb.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>You're</i> <b>always</b> <i>looking for faults</i>.</li>
	<li><i>It's</i> <b>always</b> <i>raining</i>.</li>
	<li><i>And she</i><b>'s always</b> <i>talking to him on the telephone</i>.</li>
	<li><i>They are</i> <b>forever</b> <i>being knocked down by cars</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The use of the present continuous to talk about frequent, habitual actions is explained in paragraph <b>5.20</b>.</p>
