<p class="subTitle">8.66 contrast</p>
<p>If you simply want to contrast two statements, you use 'although', 'though', 'even though', or 'while'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>I used to read a lot</i> <b>although</b> <i>I don't get much time for books now</i>.</li>
	<li><b>Though</b> <i>he has lived for years in London, he writes in German</i>.</li>
	<li><i>I used to love listening to her</i>, <b>even though</b> <i>I could only understand about half of what she said</i>.</li>
	<li><b>While</b> <i>I did well in class, I was a poor performer at games</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>'Whilst' and 'whereas' can also be used. They are fairly formal words.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>Raspberries have a matt, spongy surface</i> <b>whilst</b> <i>blackberries have a taut, shiny skin</i>.</li>
	<li><i>To every child adult approval means love</i>, <b>whereas</b> <i>disapproval means hate</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p class="clgm_hw">8.67</p>
<p>If you want to say that something which is probably true does not affect the truth of something else, you use 'even if'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>All this is part of modern commercial life (</i><b>even if</b> <i>it is not as essential an activity as most participants care to believe)</i>.</li>
	<li><i>From the minute he does these things he begins to be a different person</i>, <b>even if</b> <i>he doesn't realize it</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>'Even if' is also used in <b>conditional clauses</b>. This use is explained in paragraph <b>8.39</b>.</p>
<p class="clgm_hw">8.68</p>
<p>You use 'not that' instead of using 'although' and a negative. For example, instead of saying 'I have decided to leave, although no one will miss me', you can say 'I have decided to leave --- not that anyone will miss me'.</p>
<p>Clauses beginning with 'not that' always go after a main clause.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>I wouldn't want to give away any secrets at this stage --- </i><b>not that</b> <i>we've got any answers yet</i>.</li>
	<li><i>Kunta continued sleeping in Omoro's hut for the next seven nights --- </i><b>not that</b> <i>anyone seemed to notice or care</i>.</li>
</ul>
