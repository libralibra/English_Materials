<p class="subTitle">3.52 object already mentioned</p>
<p>There is another group of verbs which are usually transitive but which can be used intransitively with the same meaning. These are verbs where the object is obvious because it has already been mentioned. For example, if you have already mentioned the place where something happened, you can say 'I left', without naming the place again.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>At last she thanked them and</i> <b>left</b>.</li>
	<li><i>He turned away and walked quickly up the passage. I locked the door and</i> <b>followed</b>.</li>
	<li><i>I was in the middle of a quiet meal when the tanks</i> <b>attacked</b>.</li>
	<li><i>She did not look round when he</i> <b>entered</b>.</li>
	<li><i>The sentry fired at the doctor and fortunately</i> <b>missed</b>.</li>
	<li><i>Only two or three hundred men belonged to the Union before the war, now thousands</i> <b>joined</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p class="clgm_hw">3.53</p>
<p>Here is a list of verbs which can be used without an object when the object has already been mentioned:</p>
<ul>
	<li class="c_list"><b>accept, aim, answer, approach, ask, attack, begin, bite, blow, board, call, check, choose, consider, direct, dry, enter, explain, fit, follow, forget, gain, guess, improve, join, judge, know, lead, leave, lose, mind, miss, move, notice, observe, offer, order, pass, phone, play, produce, pull, push, remember, ring, rule, search, serve, share, sign, strike, telephone, understand, watch, win</b></li>
</ul>
<p class="clgm_hw">3.54</p>
<p>If you think that the object may not be obvious from what has been said or if you particularly want to draw attention to it, you mention it.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>All I know is that Michael and I never</i> <b>left the house</b>.</li>
	<li><i>Miss Lindley</i> <b>followed Rose</b> <i>into the shop</i>.</li>
	<li><i>He</i> <b>attacked the enemy</b> <i>by night</i>.</li>
	<li><i>I</i> <b>entered the Duke's cabin</b> <i>without knocking</i>.</li>
	<li><i>She threw the first dart and</i> <b>missed the board</b> <i>altogether</i>.</li>
	<li><i>I</i> <b>had joined an athletic club</b> <i>in Chicago</i>.</li>
</ul>
