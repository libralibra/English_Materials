<p class="subTitle">1.84 Specifying more exactly: compound nouns</p>
<p>A single noun is often not sufficient to refer clearly and unambiguously to a person or thing. When this is the case, a <b>compound noun</b> can be used. A compound noun is a fixed expression which is made up of more than one word and which functions in the clause as a noun.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>Some people write out a new</i> <b>address book</b> <i>every January</i>.</li>
	<li><i>How would one actually choose a small</i> <b>personal computer?</b></li>
	<li><i>Where did you hide the</i> <b>can opener?</b></li>
	<li><i>...a private</i> <b>swimming pool</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once it is clear what you are referring to, it is sometimes possible to use just the second word of a two-word compound noun. For example, after mentioning 'a swimming pool', you can just refer to 'the pool'.</p>
<p>Most compound nouns consist of two words, but some consist of three or more words.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>...a vase of</i> <b>lily of the valley</b>.</li>
</ul>
