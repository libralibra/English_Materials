<p>One common way of referring back to something is to use a <b>personal pronoun</b> such as 'she', 'it', or 'them', or a <b>possessive pronoun</b> such as 'mine' or 'hers'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>Davis opened a door. 'Here's your room. I'm afraid</i> <b>it</b><i>'s a bit untidy.'</i> <b>He</b> <i>picked a dirty handkerchief off the floor and stuffed</i> <b>it</b> <i>in a drawer</i>.</li>
	<li><i>The keeper came loping softly up the lane with the dog padding at his heels, and we watched</i> <b>them</b> <i>through the hedge as</i> <b>they</b> <i>went by</i>.</li>
