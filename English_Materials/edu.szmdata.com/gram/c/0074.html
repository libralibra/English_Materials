<p class="subTitle">1.77 USAGE NOTE</p>
<p>Most names of animals are used to refer to both male and female animals, for example 'cat', 'elephant', 'horse', 'monkey', and 'sheep'.</p>
<p>In some cases there are different words that refer specifically to male animals or female animals, for example a male horse is a 'stallion' and a female horse is a 'mare'.</p>
<p>In other cases the general name for the animal is also the specific word for males or females: 'dog' also refers more specifically to male dogs, 'duck' also refers more specifically to female ducks.</p>
<p>Many of these specific words are rarely used, or used mainly by people who have a special interest in animals, such as farmers or vets.</p>
<p>Here is a list of some common specific words for male and female animals:</p>
<ul>
	<li class="c_list"><b>stallion, mare,  --- , cow, bull,  --- , cock, hen,  --- , dog, bitch,  --- , duck, drake,  --- , fox, vixen,  --- , goose, gander,  --- , lion, lioness,  --- , ram, ewe,  --- , buck, hind, stag, doe,  --- , tiger, tigress,  --- , boar, sow</b></li>
