<p class="subTitle">5.113 Frequency and duration</p>
<p>When indicating how often something happens, or how long it lasts or takes, units of time are often used:</p>
<ul>
	<li class="c_list"><b>second, minute, hour, day, night, week, month, year, decade, century</b></li>
</ul>
<p>'Fortnight' is also used, but only in the singular. 'Moment' can also be used, but not with numbers because it does not refer to a precise period of time, so you cannot say for example 'It took five moments'.</p>
<p>Words for periods of the day, days of the week, months of the year, and seasons are also used, such as 'morning', 'Friday', 'July', and 'winter'.</p>
<p>Clock times may also be used.</p>
