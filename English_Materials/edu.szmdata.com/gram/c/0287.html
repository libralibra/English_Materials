<p class="subTitle">2.125 USAGE NOTE</p>
<p>In informal speech, people often use a superlative rather than using a comparative when they are talking about two things. For example, someone might say 'The train is quickest' rather than 'The train is quicker' when comparing a train service with a bus service. However, some people think that it is better to use superlatives only when comparing more than two things.</p>
