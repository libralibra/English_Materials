<p class="subTitle">2.270 adjectives after measurements</p>
<p>When measurement nouns that give the size of something are used as complements, they can often be followed by an adjective which makes it clear exactly what the measurement refers to.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>He was about</i> <b>six feet tall</b>.</li>
	<li><i>The spears were about</i> <b>six foot long</b>.</li>
	<li><i>...a room</i> <b>2 metres wide</b>.</li>
	<li><i>The water was</i> <b>fifteen feet deep</b>.</li>
	<li><i>...a layer of stone</i> <b>four metres thick</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is a list of the adjectives that follow measurement nouns indicating size:</p>
<ul>
	<li class="c_list"><b>broad, deep, high, long, tall, thick, wide</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Note that you do not say 'two pounds heavy' but 'two pounds in weight' instead.</p>
