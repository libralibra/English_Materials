<p class="subTitle">4.117 unwillingness: 'would not'</p>
<p>When 'would' is used with 'not' to talk about something that happened in the past, it has a special meaning. It is used to say that someone was unwilling to do something, or refused to do something.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>They just</i> <b>would not</b> <i>believe what we told them</i>.</li>
	<li><i>After all this, I</i> <b>wouldn't</b> <i>come back to the farm</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The use of modals to express unwillingness or a refusal is dealt with fully in paragraphs <b>4.200 to 4.205</b>.</p>
