<p class="subTitle">4.261 negatives</p>
<p>'Used to' is not common in negative structures.</p>
<p>In informal speech, people sometimes make negative statements by putting 'didn't' in front of 'used to'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>They</i> <b>didn't used to</b> <i>mind what we did</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, many people consider this use to be incorrect.</p>
<p>Another way to form the negative is to put 'never' in front of 'used to'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>Where I was before, we</i> <b>never used to</b> <i>have posters on the walls</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sometimes 'not' is put between 'used' and 'to'. This is a fairly formal use.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>It</i> <b>used not to</b> <i>be taxable</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some grammar books give a contracted form for the negative, 'usedn't to' or 'usen't to'. This is now rarely used, and is thought to be very old-fashioned.</p>
