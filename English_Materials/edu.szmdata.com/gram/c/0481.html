<p class="subTitle">3.71 emphasizing equal involvement</p>
<p>When you want to emphasize that both participants are equally involved in the action, you put 'each other' or 'one another' after the verb group.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>We embraced</i> <b>each other</b>.</li>
	<li><i>They kissed</i> <b>each other</b> <i>in greeting</i>.</li>
	<li><i>They fought</i> <b>each other</b> <i>desperately for it</i>.</li>
	<li><i>It was the first time they had touched</i> <b>one another</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is a list of reciprocal verbs which are used transitively with the pronouns 'each other' and 'one another':</p>
<ul>
	<li class="c_list"><b>consult, cuddle, embrace, engage, fight, hug, kiss, marry, match, meet, touch</b></li>
</ul>
<p>With some verbs you need to use a preposition, usually 'with', in front of 'each other' or 'one another'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>You've got to be able to communicate</i> <b>with each other</b>.</li>
	<li><i>Third World countries are competing</i> <b>with each other</b> <i>for a restricted market</i>.</li>
	<li><i>His visitors agreed</i> <b>with one another</b> <i>to proceed to the coffee-house</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is a list of reciprocal verbs which must be followed by 'with' before the pronouns 'each other' and 'one another':</p>
<ul>
	<li class="c_list"><b>agree, alternate, argue, balance, clash, coincide, collide, combine, communicate, conflict, consult, contend, contrast, converse, co-operate, disagree, engage, integrate, mate, merge, mix, quarrel, struggle</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Here is a list of verbs which are used with a preposition other than 'with':</p>
<ul>
	<li class="c_list"><b>compete (against, compete (with), correspond (to), correspond (with), fight (against), fight (with), part (from), relate (to), separate (from), talk (to), talk (with)</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Note that 'consult', 'engage', and 'fight' can be used either transitively or with a preposition.</p>
