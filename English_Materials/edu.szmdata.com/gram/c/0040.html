<p class="subTitle">1.42 Referring to more than one thing: plural nouns</p>
<p>There are some things which are thought of as being plural rather than singular, so some nouns have only a plural form. For example, you can buy 'goods', but not 'a good'. These nouns are called <b>plural nouns</b>.</p>
<p>Other nouns have only a plural form when they are used with a particular meaning. For example, an official meeting between American and Russian leaders is usually referred to as 'talks' rather than as 'a talk'. In these meanings, these nouns are also called <b>plural nouns</b>.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>Union leaders met the company for wage</i> <b>talks</b> <i>on October 9</i>.</li>
	<li><i>It is inadvisable to sell</i> <b>goods</b> <i>on a sale or return basis</i>.</li>
	<li><i>Take care of your</i> <b>clothes</b>.</li>
	<li><i>The weather</i> <b>conditions</b> <i>were the same</i>.</li>
	<li><i>All</i> <b>proceeds</b> <i>are going to charity</i>.</li>
	<li><i>Employees can have meals on the</i> <b>premises</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that some plural nouns do not end in '-s': for example 'clergy', 'police', 'poultry', and 'vermin'.</p>
