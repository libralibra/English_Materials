<p class="subTitle">1.123 Referring to a particular person or thing: demonstrative pronouns</p>
<p>When 'this', 'that', 'these', and 'those' are used as pronouns, they are called <b>demonstrative pronouns</b>. They can be used as the subject or the object of a clause, or the object of a preposition.</p>
<p>Demonstrative pronouns are rarely used as the indirect object of a clause, because the indirect object is usually a person and demonstrative pronouns normally refer to things.</p>
