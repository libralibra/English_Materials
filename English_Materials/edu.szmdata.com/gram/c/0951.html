<p class="subTitle">6.32 irregular forms</p>
<p>Some very common adverbs have comparatives and superlatives that are single words and not formed using 'more' and 'most'. Note that adverbs that have irregular comparatives also have irregular superlatives.</p>
<p>'Well' has the comparative 'better', and the superlative 'best'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>She would ask him later</i>, <i>when she knew him</i> <b>better</b>.</li>
	<li><i>I have to find out what I can do</i> <b>best</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>'Badly' has the comparative 'worse' and the superlative 'worst'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>'I don't think the crowd helped her,' Gordon admitted. 'She played</i> <b>worse.'</b></li>
	<li><i>The expedition from Mozambique fared</i> <b>worst</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that 'worse' and 'worst' are also the comparative and superlative of 'ill' when it is an adverb or adjective.</p>
<p class="clgm_hw">6.33</p>
<p>Adverbs which have the same form as adjectives also have the same comparatives and superlatives as the adjectives. For example, 'fast' has 'faster' and 'fastest', and 'hard' has 'harder' and 'hardest'. For a list of common adverbs which have the same form as adjectives, see paragraph <b>6.23</b>.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>This would enable claims to be dealt with</i> <b>faster</b>.</li>
	<li><i>They worked</i> <b>harder</b>, <i>they were more honest</i>.</li>
	<li><i>The winning blow is the one that strikes</i> <b>hardest</b>.</li>
	<li><i>The sugar should be preserving sugar as this dissolves</i> <b>fastest</b>.</li>
	<li><i>The tax burden increased</i> <b>fastest</b> <i>for the poor and for those with children</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p class="clgm_hw">6.34</p>
<p>Some adverbs have comparatives and superlatives with 'more' and 'most', but also have single word comparatives and superlatives.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>They can be built</i> <b>more quickly</b>.</li>
	<li><i>You probably learn</i> <b>quicker</b> <i>by having lessons</i>.</li>

	<li><i>South Africa's diamonds, gold, and uranium weigh</i> <b>heavier</b> <i>in the balance than Guinea's bananas</i>.</li>
	<li><i>The burden fell</i> <b>most heavily</b> <i>on Kanhai</i>.</li>
