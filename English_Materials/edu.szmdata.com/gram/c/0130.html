<p class="subTitle">1.146 'who' and 'whom'</p>
<p>'Who' and 'whom' always refer to people.</p>
<p>'Who' can be the subject of a relative clause.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>...mathematicians</i> <b>who</b> <i>are concerned with very difficult problems</i>.</li>
	<li><i>...a man</i> <b>who</b> <i> I met recently</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the past, 'whom' was normally used as the object of a relative clause. Nowadays, 'who' is more often used, although some careful speakers of English think that it is more correct to use 'whom'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>There's a woman over there</i> <b>who</b> <i>I can't help noticing</i>.</li>
	<li><i>He's the man</i> <b>who</b> <i>I saw last night</i>.</li>
	<li><i>...two girls</i> <b>whom</b> <i>I met in Edinburgh</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>'Who' is sometimes used as the object of a preposition when the object is separated from the preposition. Some careful speakers think that it is more correct to use 'whom'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>That's the man</i> <b>who</b> <i>I gave it to</i>.</li>
	<li><i>...those</i> <b>whom</b> <i>we cannot talk to</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>'Whom' is almost always used when the object comes immediately after the preposition.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>...Lord Scarman. a man</i> <b>for whom</b> <i> I have immense respect</i>.</li>
</ul>
