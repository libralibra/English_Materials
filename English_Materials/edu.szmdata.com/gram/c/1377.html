<p class="subTitle">10.110 Making a statement into a question: question tags</p>
<p>This section deals with <b>tags</b> or <b>question tags</b>. A <b>tag</b> is a short structure that is added to the end of a statement to turn it into a question. This is usually done when you expect the person you are addressing to agree with you or confirm your statement. Tags are most often used in spoken English. The whole sentence, consisting of the statement and the tag, is called a <b>tag question</b>.</p>
