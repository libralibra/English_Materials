<p>'Could' and 'would' are used in place of 'can' and 'will' when you are reporting what someone has said.</p>
<p>For example, if a man has said 'I can come', you report this as 'He said that he could come'. Similarly, if has he said, 'I will come', you report this as 'He said that he would come'.</p>
