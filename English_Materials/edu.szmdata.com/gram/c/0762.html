<p class="subTitle">4.190 polite suggestions: 'might'</p>
<p>If you want to make a suggestion in a very polite way, you can use 'might' with 'you' in a declarative sentence. 'Might' is followed by a verb meaning 'to like' or 'to want'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>You</i> <b>might</b> <i>like to comment on his latest proposal</i>.</li>
	<li><i>I thought perhaps you</i> <b>might</b> <i>like to come along with me</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also make a polite suggestion by using a sentence beginning with 'It might be', followed by a noun group or adjective and a 'to'-infinitive clause.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>I think it</i> <b>might</b> <i>be a good idea to stop the recording now</i>.</li>
	<li><i>It</i> <b>might</b> <i>be wise to consult the wine waiter</i>.</li>
</ul>
