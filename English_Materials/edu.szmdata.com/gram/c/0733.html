<p class="subTitle">4.160 Giving instructions and making requests</p>
<p>When you give an instruction or make a request, you usually use a modal in an interrogative sentence.</p>
<p>You use 'will', 'would', 'can', or 'could' with 'you' to tell someone to do something, or to ask someone to do something.</p>
<p>You use 'can', 'could', 'may', or 'might' with 'I' or 'we' or with other personal pronouns or noun groups to ask someone's permission to do something.</p>
<p>Instructions and requests are always made more polite by adding 'please'. 'Please' and other markers of politeness are explained in paragraph <b>4.176</b>.</p>
