<p class="subTitle">2.48 predicative adjectives</p>
<p>Some adjectives are normally used only as the complement of a link verb and not in front of a noun. These adjectives are called <b>predicative adjectives</b>.</p>
<p>For example, you can say 'She felt glad', but you do not normally talk about 'a glad woman'.</p>
<p>Here is a list of adjectives usually used predicatively:</p>
<ul>
	<li class="c_list"><b>afraid, alive, alone, apart, asleep, aware, content, due, glad, ill, likely, ready, safe, sorry, sure, unable, unlikely, well</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Note that they are not usually followed by a prepositional phrase.</p>
<p class="clgm_hw">2.49</p>
<p>Because their meaning would otherwise be unclear or incomplete, some adjectives are usually followed by a prepositional phrase. For example, you cannot simply say that someone is 'accustomed'. You have to say that they are 'accustomed to' something.</p>
<p>The following usage notes explain which prepositions you use after a particular adjective.</p>
