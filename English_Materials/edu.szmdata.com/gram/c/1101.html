<p class="subTitle">8.12 USAGE NOTE</p>
<p>If you want to emphasize that something happened at a particular time, you can use 'It was' followed by an expression such as 'six o'clock' or 'three hours later', followed by a 'when'-clause.</p>
<p>For example, instead of saying 'I left at six o'clock', you say 'It was six o'clock when I left'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>It was about half past eight</i> <b>when</b> <i>he arrived at Sutwick</i>.</li>
	<li><i>It was late</i> <b>when</b> <i>he returned</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is an example of a <b>cleft structure</b>. Cleft structures are explained in paragraphs <b>10.25 to 10.30</b>.</p>
