<p class="subTitle">10.16 passive of verbs referring to states</p>
<p>A few transitive verbs refer to states rather than actions. When some of these verbs are used in the passive, the agent is put after the preposition 'with'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>The room</i> <b>was filled with</b> <i>pleasant furniture</i>.</li>
	<li><i>The railings</i> <b>were decorated with</b> <i>thousands of bouquets</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is a list of transitive verbs referring to states which are used with 'with' in the passive:</p>
<ul>
	<li class="c_list"><b>cram, crowd, decorate, fill, ornament, throng</b></li>
</ul>
<p>However, 'by' is used with some verbs which describe a state.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>The Melbourne meeting is likely to</i> <b>be overshadowed by</b> <i>the implications of the recent Ottawa economic summit</i>.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li class="c_list"><b>conceal, exceed, illuminate, inhabit, occupy, overshadow</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Some verbs, such as 'adorn' and 'surround' can be used with 'with' or 'by' after them.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>Her right hand</i> <b>was covered with</b> <i>blood</i>.</li>
	<li><i>One entire wall</i> <b>was covered by</b> <i>a gigantic chart of the English Channel</i>.</li>
	<li><i>The house</i> <b>was surrounded with</b> <i>tanks and policemen with dogs</i>.</li>
	<li><i>The building</i> <b>was surrounded by</b> <i>a deep green lawn</i>.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li class="c_list"><b>adorn, besiege, cover, encircle, overrun, surround</b></li>
</ul>
<p>There are also several verbs which are used with 'in'.</p>

	<li><i>Free transport</i> <b>was not included in</b> <i>the contract</i>.</li>
