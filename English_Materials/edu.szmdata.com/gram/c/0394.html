<p class="subTitle">2.267 Talking about measurements</p>
<p>You can refer to a size, distance, area, volume, weight, speed, or temperature, by using a number or quantifier in front of a <b>measurement noun</b>. Measurement nouns are countable.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>They grow to twenty</i> <b>feet</b>.</li>
	<li><i>...blocks of stone weighing up to a hundred</i> <b>tons</b>.</li>
	<li><i>The daily requirement of vitamin B1 is 1 --- 10</i> <b>milligrams</b>.</li>
	<li><i>Reduce the temperature by a few</i> <b>degrees</b>.</li>
	<li><i>Average annual temperatures exceed</i> <b>20&deg; centigrade</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other ways of expressing distance are explained in paragraphs <b>6.71 to 6.72</b>. Measurement nouns referring to size, area, volume, and weight are often used in <b>partitive structures</b> (see paragraphs <b>2.211 to 2.224</b>) such as 'a pint of milk' and 'a pound of onions'. They can also be used as <b>qualifiers</b> beginning with 'of', (see paragraph <b>2.300</b>).</p>
