<p class="subTitle">4.111 the future: 'shall' and 'will'</p>
<p>'Shall' and 'will' are exceptions to this.</p>
<p>'Shall' always indicates that you are talking about a future event or situation.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>I</i> <b>shall</b> <i>do what you suggested</i>.</li>
	<li><i>Eventually we</i> <b>shall</b> <i>find a solution</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>'Will' usually indicates that you are talking about a future event or situation.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>The farmer</i> <b>will</b> <i>feel more responsible towards his workers</i>.</li>
	<li><i>He</i> <b>will</b> <i>not return for many hours</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>However 'will' is sometimes used to talk about present situations.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>You</i> <b>will</b> <i>not feel much love for him at the moment</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>This use of 'will' is described in paragraph <b>4.124</b>.</p>
<p class="clgm_hw">4.112</p>
<p>'Could' and 'would' are sometimes described as past tense forms of 'can' and 'will'. However this is true in only a few minor ways. These are explained in the following paragraphs.</p>
