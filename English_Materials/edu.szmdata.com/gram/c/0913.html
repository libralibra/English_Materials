<p class="subTitle">5.123 Adjuncts of duration</p>
<p>The following section explains ways of indicating how long something lasts or takes.</p>
<p>Some adverbs and adverbial expressions can be used as adjuncts to indicate the duration of an event or state. Here is a list of adverbs which are used to indicate duration:</p>
<ul>
	<li class="c_list"><b>always, briefly, for ever, indefinitely, overnight, permanently, temporarily</b></li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><i>She glanced</i> <b>briefly</b> <i>at Lucas Simmonds</i>.</li>
	<li><i>You won't live</i> <b>for ever</b>.</li>
	<li><i>The flat had been let to them by one of Daisy's friends who was</i> <b>temporarily</b> <i>in America</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>'Briefly' and 'permanently' can be used in the comparative.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>This new revelation had much the same outward effect, though</i> <b>more briefly</b>.</li>
	<li><i>Urging them reduces the appetite further and</i> <b>more permanently</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The form 'long' is only used as an adverb in negative clauses, and questions.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>I haven't been in England</i> <b>long</b>.</li>
	<li><i>How</i> <b>long</b> <i>does it take on the train?</i></li>
</ul>
<p>In positive clauses, it is used in expressions such as 'a long time' and prepositional phrases such as 'for a long time'. However, the comparative and superlative forms 'longer' and 'longest' can be used in positive and negative clauses.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>Then of course you'll go with Parry. She's been your friend</i> <b>longer</b>.</li>
	<li><i>I've been thinking about it a lot</i> <b>longer</b> <i>than you</i>.</li>
	<li><i>She remained</i> <b>the longest</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>In affirmative and negative 'if'-clauses, you can use 'for long'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>If she's away</i> <b>for long</b> <i>we won't be able to wait</i>.</li>
</ul>
