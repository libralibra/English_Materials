<p class="subTitle">9.66 ellipsis in replies</p>
<p>When you reply to <b>'wh'-questions</b>, you can often use one word or a group of words rather than a full sentence. You do this to avoid repeating words used in the question. For example, if someone asks 'What is your favourite colour?', the normal reply is a single word, for example 'Blue', rather than a sentence such as 'My favourite colour is blue'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>'What's your name?' --- </i><b>'Pete.'</b></li>
	<li><i>'How do you feel?' --- </i><b>'Strange.'</b></li>
	<li><i>'Where do you come from?' --- </i><b>'Cardiff.'</b></li>
	<li><i>'Where are we going? --- </i><b>'Up the coast.'</b></li>
	<li><i>'How long have you been out of this country?'</i><b> --- 'About three months.'</b></li>
	<li><i>'How much money is there in that case?' --- </i><b>'Six hundred pounds.'</b></li>
	<li><i>'Why should they want me to know?' --- </i><b>'To scare you</b>, <i>perhaps. Who can tell?'</i></li>
</ul>
<p>'Wh'-questions are explained in paragraphs <b>4.17 to 4.30</b>.</p>
<p class="clgm_hw">9.67</p>
<p>You can often use a <b>sentence adverb</b> or an <b>adverb of degree</b> rather than a sentence in answer to a <b>'yes/no'-question</b>.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>'Do you think you could keep your mouth shut if I was to tell you something?' --- '</i><b>Definitely.'</b></li>
	<li><i>'Do you think they're very important?' --- </i><b>'Maybe.'</b></li>
	<li><i>'Do you enjoy life at the university?' --- 'Oh yes</i>, <b>very much.'</b></li>
	<li><i>'Are you interested?' --- '</i><b>Very.'</b></li>
	<li><i>'Are you ready, Matthew?' --- '</i><b>Not quite.'</b></li>
	<li><i>'Is she sick?' --- '</i><b>Not exactly.'</b></li>
</ul>
<p>'Yes/no'-questions are explained in paragraphs <b>4.12 to 4.16</b>. Sentence adjuncts are listed in Chapter 10 (<b>10.57 to 10.72</b>). Adverbs of degree are listed in Chapter 2 (<b>2.145</b> to <b>2.173</b>) and Chapter 6 (<b>6.45</b> to <b>6.52</b>).</p>
