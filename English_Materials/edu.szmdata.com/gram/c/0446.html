<p class="subTitle">3.22 transitive verbs of position and movement</p>
<p>Note that some verbs of movement and position are transitive, not intransitive; they are followed by noun groups referring to places instead of by adjuncts. This is because the verbs themselves indicate that you are talking about movement or position of a particular kind. For example, 'enter' implies movement 'into' a place and 'occupy' implies position 'in' a place.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>As they</i> <b>neared</b> <i>the outskirts of the city the traffic thickened</i>.</li>
	<li><i>It was dark by the time they</i> <b>reached</b> <i>their house</i>.</li>
	<li><i>A small ornamental pool</i> <b>occupied</b> <i>the centre of the room</i>.</li>
	<li><i>Roaring aircraft</i> <i>filled</i> <i>the sky</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is a list of transitive verbs of movement:</p>
<ul>
	<li class="c_list"><b>approach, enter, leave, near, reach, round</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Here is a list of transitive verbs of position:</p>
<ul>
	<li class="c_list"><b>cover, crowd, fill, inhabit, occupy, throng</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Some verbs of movement can be followed either by a noun group or by a prepositional phrase. See paragraph <b>3.59</b>.</p>
