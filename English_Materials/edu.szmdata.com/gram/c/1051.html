<p class="subTitle">7.34 'wh'-questions</p>
<p>The other type of question is called a <b>'wh'-question</b>. These are questions in which someone asks for information about an event or situation. 'Wh'-questions cannot be answered with 'yes' or 'no'.</p>
<p>When you report a 'wh'-question, you use a <b>'wh'-word</b> at the beginning of the reported clause.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>He asked</i> <b>where I was going</b>.</li>
	<li><i>She enquired</i> <b>why I was so late</b>.</li>
	<li><i>She leaned over the stairs and called down to ask</i> <b>what had happened</b>.</li>
	<li><i>I asked</i> <b>how they liked the film</b>.</li>
	<li><i>It never occurred to me to ask</i> <b>who put it there</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>When the details of the question are clear from the context, you can sometimes leave out everything except the 'wh'-word. This happens mostly in spoken English, especially with 'why'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>I asked</i> <b>why</b>.</li>
	<li><i>They enquired</i> <b>how</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>For more information about 'wh'-questions see paragraphs <b>4.17 to 4.30</b>.</p>
<p class="clgm_hw">7.35</p>
<p>Other verbs can be used before clauses beginning with 'wh'-words, because they refer to knowing, learning, or giving one of the circumstances of an event or situation.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>She doesn't know</i> <b>what we were talking about</b>.</li>
	<li><i>They couldn't see</i> <b>how they would manage without her</b>.</li>
	<li><i>I wonder</i> <b>what's happened</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is a list of other verbs which can be used before clauses beginning with 'wh'-words:</p>
<ul>
	<li class="c_list"><b>decide, describe, discover, discuss, explain, forget, guess, imagine, know, learn, realize, remember, reveal, say, see, suggest, teach, tell, think, understand, wonder</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Note that 'imagine', 'say', 'see', 'suggest', and 'think' are usually used in a negative or interrogative clause, or a clause with a modal.</p>
<p>All the verbs in the list, except 'describe', 'discuss', and 'wonder', can also be used with 'that'-clauses: see paragraph <b>7.27</b>.</p>
