<p class="subTitle">10.31 Taking the focus off the subject: using impersonal 'it'</p>
<p>You often only want to mention one thing or fact in a clause. For example, you often want to focus on the type of information that is normally expressed by an adjective. But an adjective cannot stand alone as the subject of a clause. A common way of presenting information of this kind is to make the adjective the complement of 'be', with 'it' as the subject.</p>
<p>If you do not want to choose any of the clause elements as the thing you are going to talk about, you can use several structures with 'it' as subject.</p>
<p>'It' can be used:</p>
<p>*  to describe a place or situation</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>It</b><i>'s lonely here</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>*  to talk about the weather or to say what the time is.</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>It</b> <i>had been raining all day</i>.</li>
	<li><b>It</b> <i>is seven o'clock</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>These uses are often called the <b>impersonal</b> uses of 'it'.</p>
<p class="clgm_hw">10.32</p>
<p>In these uses, 'it' does not refer back to anything earlier in the speech or writing, and so it is different from the <b>personal pronoun</b>, which usually refers back to a particular noun group:</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>The sun</b> <i>kept changing everything as</i> <b>it</b> <i>moved across the sky</i>.</li>
	<li><b>Paris</b> <i>is special, isn't</i> <b>it?</b></li>
</ul>
<p>For more information about personal pronouns, see the section beginning at paragraph <b>1.96</b>.</p>
<p>Note that the pronoun 'it' can also be used to refer to a whole situation or fact which has been described or implied.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>He's never come to see his son</i>. <b>It'</b><i>s most peculiar, isn't it?</i></li>
	<li><b>It</b> <i>doesn't matter</i>.</li>
	<li><b>It'</b><i>s my fault</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p class="clgm_hw">10.33</p>
<p>'It' can also be used to introduce a comment on an action, activity, or experience. The subject 'it' refers forward to a 'to'-infinitive clause or a finite subordinate clause.</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>It</b> <i>costs so much</i> <b>to get there</b>.</li>
	<li><b>It</b> <i>was amazing</i> <b>that audiences came to the theatre at all</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>This structure with 'it' allows you to avoid having a long subject, and to put what you are talking about in a more prominent position at the end of the sentence.</p>
