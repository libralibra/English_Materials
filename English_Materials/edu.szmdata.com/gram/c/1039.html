<p class="subTitle">7.19 position of reporting verb</p>
<p>There are several positions in which you can put the reporting clause in relation to a quote. The usual position is after the quote, but it can also go in front of the quote or in the middle of the quote.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>'You have to keep trying, Mabel,' he said</i>.</li>
	<li><i>He stepped back and said, 'Now look at that.'</i></li>
	<li><i>'You see,' he said, 'my father was a clergyman.'</i></li>
</ul>
<p class="clgm_hw">7.20</p>
<p>If you put the reporting clause in the middle of a quote, it must go in one of the following positions:</p>
<p>*  after a <b>noun group</b></p>
<ul>
	<li><i>'That man,' I said, 'never opened a window in his life.'</i></li>
</ul>
<p>*  after a <b>vocative</b></p>
<ul>
	<li><i>'Darling,' Max said to her, 'don't say it's not possible.'</i></li>
</ul>
<p>*  after a <b>sentence adverb</b></p>
<ul>
	<li><i>'Maybe,' he said hesitantly, 'maybe there is a beast.'</i></li>
</ul>
<p>*  after a <b>clause</b>, if the quote contains more than one clause.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>'I rang the bell,' Rudolph said, 'and your friend let me in.'</i></li>
</ul>
<p class="clgm_hw">7.21</p>
<p>You can use most reporting verbs in front of a quote.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>She replied, 'My first thought was to protect him.'</i></li>
	<li><i>One student commented: 'He seems to know his material very well.'</i></li>
</ul>
<p>However, the reporting verbs 'agree', 'command', 'promise', and 'wonder' are hardly ever used in front of a quote.</p>
