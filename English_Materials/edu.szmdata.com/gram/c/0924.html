<p class="subTitle">5.140 end time</p>
<p>Similarly, if you want to say that a situation continues for some time and then stops, you can indicate the time when it stops by using the preposition 'until' with a time expression or an event.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>The school was kept open</i> <b>until ten o'clock</b> <i>five nights a week</i>.</li>
	<li><i>They danced and laughed and talked</i> <b>until dawn</b>.</li>
	<li><i>She walked back again and sat in her room</i> <b>until dinner</b>.</li>
	<li><i>I've just discovered she's only here</i> <b>until Sunday</b>.</li>
	<li><i>He had been willing to wait</i> <b>until the following summer</b>.</li>
	<li><b>Until the third century A.D</b>. <i>female slaves were below the law</i>.</li>
	<li><b>Until that meeting</b>, <i>most of us knew very little about him</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>'Until' can also be used in negative clauses to say that something did not or will not happen before a particular time.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>We</i> <b>won't</b> <i>get them</i> <b>until September</b>.</li>
	<li><i>My plane does</i> <b>not</b> <i>leave</i> <b>until tomorrow morning</b>.</li>
	<li><b>No one</b> <i>I knew had cars</i> <b>until the twenties</b>.</li>
	<li><i>It won't happen for many good months to come --- probably</i> <b>not</b> <b>until the spring</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>'Until' can also be used with other prepositional phrases that indicate a point in time.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>The Count had resolved to wait</i> <b>until after Christmas</b> <i>to propose to Gertrude</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some people use 'till' instead of 'until', especially in informal English.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>Sometimes I lie in bed</i> <b>till nine o'clock</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>'Up to' and 'up till' are also sometimes used, mainly before 'now' and 'then'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Up to now</b> <i>the Warsaw pact had held the whole initiative</i>.</li>
	<li><i>It was something he had never even considered</i> <b>up till now</b>.</li>
	<li><i>I had a three-wheel bike</i> <b>up to a few years ago</b> <i>but it got harder and harder to push it along</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p class="clgm_hw">5.141</p>
<p>You can also use the preposition 'before' to indicate when a situation ends.</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Before 1716</b> <i>Cheltenham had been a small market town</i>.</li>
	<li><b>Before ten</b> <i>and after six the area is empty</i>.</li>
</ul>
