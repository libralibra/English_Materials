<p class="subTitle">3.2 Indicating how many participants are involved: transitivity</p>
<p>In this grammar, transitivity is explained in relation to the clause as a whole. Many grammars deal with transitivity in terms of the way in which a verb selects objects. However, the verb, while usually central in clause structure, is not necessarily chosen first. This grammar explains subject, verb, and object relations by describing how statements are created.</p>
