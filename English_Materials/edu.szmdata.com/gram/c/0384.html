<p class="subTitle">2.257 Referring to an exact part of something: fractions</p>
<p>When you want to indicate how large a part of something is compared to the whole of it, you use a <b>fraction</b>, such as 'a third', followed by 'of' and a noun group referring to the whole thing. Fractions can also be written in figures (see paragraph <b>2.265</b>).</p>
