<p class="subTitle">3.31 WARNING</p>
<p>Note that reflexive pronouns are not used as much in English as in some other languages when talking about actions that you do to yourself. As mentioned above, you would usually say 'I washed' rather than 'I washed myself' in English. Sometimes a noun group with a possessive is used instead. For example, you would say 'I combed my hair' rather than 'I combed myself'.</p>
<p class="clgm_hw">3.32</p>
<p>Note that reflexive verbs are not used in the passive.</p>
