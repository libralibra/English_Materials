<p class="subTitle">2.148 intensifying qualitative adjectives</p>
<p>You can use many submodifiers with qualitative adjectives in order to intensify their meaning.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i></i>...<b>extremely high</b> <i>temperatures</i>.</li>
	<li><i>Geoffrey was a</i> <b>deeply religious</b> <i>man</i>.</li>
	<li><i>France is</i> <b>heavily dependent</b> <i>on foreign trade</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is a list of submodifiers used to intensify the meaning of adjectives:</p>
<ul>
	<li class="c_list"><b>amazingly, awfully, bitterly, critically, dangerously, deeply, delightfully, disturbingly, dreadfully, eminently, especially, exceedingly, extraordinarily, extremely, fantastically, greatly, heavily, highly, hopelessly, horribly, hugely, impossibly, incredibly, infinitely, notably, particularly, radically, really, remarkably, seriously, strikingly, supremely, surprisingly, suspiciously, terribly, unbelievably, very, violently, vitally, wildly, wonderfully</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Note that 'very' can be used to submodify superlative adjectives when you want to be very emphatic. This is explained in paragraphs <b>2.172 to 2.173</b>.</p>
<p>Note also that adjectives with 'most' in front of them are not always superlatives. 'Most' is also used as a submodifier with the meaning 'very'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>This book was</i> <b>most interesting</b>.</li>
	<li><i>My grandfather was a</i> <b>most extraordinary</b> <i>man</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p class="clgm_hw">2.149</p>
<p>Many of these submodifiers not only intensify the meaning of the adjective but also allow you to express your opinion about what you are saying. For example, if you say that something is 'surprisingly large', you are expressing surprise at how large it is as well as intensifying the meaning of 'large'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>He has</i> <b>amazingly long</b> <i>eyelashes</i>.</li>
	<li><i>...a</i> <b>delightfully refreshing</b> <i>taste</i>.</li>
	<li><i>The cabin was</i> <b>extraordinarily quiet</b>.</li>
	<li><i>...a</i> <b>horribly uncomfortable</b> <i>chair</i>.</li>
	<li><i></i>...<b>incredibly boring</b> <i>documents</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, you use a few of them with no other purpose than to intensify the meaning of the adjective.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>They're</i> <b>awfully brave</b>.</li>
	<li><i>The other girls were</i> <b>dreadfully dull</b> <i>companions</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is a list of submodifiers only used to intensify adjectives:</p>
<ul>
	<li class="c_list"><b>awfully, dreadfully, especially, extremely, greatly, highly, horribly, really, terribly, very</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Note that 'awfully', 'dreadfully', 'horribly', and 'terribly' are used in informal language and 'highly' is used in very formal language.</p>
