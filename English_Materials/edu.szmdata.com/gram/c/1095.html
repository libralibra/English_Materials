<p class="subTitle">8.4 subordinating conjunctions</p>
<p>When you are adding a clause in order to develop some aspect of what you are saying, you use a <b>subordinating conjunction</b>.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>The cat jumped onto my father's lap</i> <b>while</b> <i>he was reading his letters</i>.</li>
	<li><i>The wound was healing</i> <b>although</b> <i>he would never be able to speak again</i>.</li>
	<li><b>When</b> <i>the jar was full, he turned the water off</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>A clause which begins with a subordinating conjunction is called a <b>subordinate clause</b>.</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>When an atom is split</b>, <i>it releases neutrons</i>.</li>
	<li><b>If he had had a gun</b>, <i>he would have killed the man</i>.</li>
	<li><i>The house was called Elm View</i>, <b>although there were no elms anywhere in sight</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Subordinate clauses can also be added to questions and imperative clauses.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>How long is it</i> <b>since you've actually taught?</b></li>
	<li><i>Know what fibre you are dyeing</i> <b>before you start</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sentences containing a main clause and one or more subordinate clauses are often called <b>complex sentences</b>.</p>
<p>There are three main kinds of subordinate clause:</p>
<p><b>Adverbial clauses</b> are dealt with in paragraphs <b>8.6 to 8.82</b>.</p>
<p><b>Relative clauses</b> are dealt with in paragraphs <b>8.83 to 8.116</b>.</p>
