<p class="subTitle">6.26 two forms</p>
<p>Sometimes, two adverbs are related to the same adjective, one adverb has the same form as the adjective, and the other is formed by adding '-ly'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>He closed his eyes</i> <b>tight</b>.</li>
	<li><i>He closed his eyes</i> <b>tightly</b>.</li>
	<li><i>They also instituted a legacy which will cost China and its present leadership</i> <b>dear</b>, <i>at home and abroad, for years to come</i>.</li>
	<li><i>Holes in the road are a menace which costs this country</i> <b>dearly</b> <i>in lost man hours every year</i>.</li>
	<li><i>The German manufacturer was urging me to cut out the middle man and deal with him</i> <b>direct</b>.</li>
	<li><i>The trend in recent years has been to deal</i> <b>directly</b> <i>with the supplier</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is a list of common adverbs that have both these forms: , clear, clearly, close, closely, dear, dearly, deep, deeply, direct, directly, easy, easily, fine, finely, first, firstly, hard, hardly, high, highly, last, lastly, late, lately, thick, thickly, thin, thinly, tight, tightly</p>
<ul>
	<li class="c_list">Note that the '-ly' adverb often has a different meaning from the adverb with the same form as the adjective,</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><i>The river was running</i> <b>high</b> <i>and swiftly</i>.</li>
	<li><i>I thought</i> <b>highly</b> <i>of the idea</i>.</li>
	<li><i>He has worked</i> <b>hard</b>.</li>
	<li><i>Border could</i> <b>hardly</b> <i>make himself heard above the din</i>.</li>
	<li><i>When the snake strikes, its mouth opens</i> <b>wide</b>.</li>
	<li><i>Closing dates for applications vary</i> <b>widely</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that, with some words that are adverbs and adjectives, the addition of '-ly' forms a new adverb and a new adjective, for example 'dead' and 'deadly', 'low' and 'lowly'.</p>
