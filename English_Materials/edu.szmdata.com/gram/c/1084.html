<p class="subTitle">7.81 prepositional phrases with reporting verbs</p>
<p>A few verbs referring to speech and thought can be used with a prepositional phrase rather than a reported clause, to indicate the general subject matter of a statement or thought.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>Thomas explained</i> <b>about the request from Paris</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are three lists of verbs which can be used with a prepositional phrase referring to a fact or subject. The first group of verbs in each list are used without an object, and the second group are used with an object referring to the hearer. Note that 'ask' and 'warn' can be used with or without an object.</p>
<p>The following verbs are used with 'about':</p>
<p><b>agree, ask, boast, complain, decide, dream, explain, forget, grumble, hear, inquire, know, learn, mutter, read, wonder, worry, write,  --- , ask, teach, tell, warn</b></p>
<ul>
	<li><i>No one knew</i> <b>about my interest in mathematics</b>.</li>
	<li><i>I asked him</i> <b>about the horses</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following verbs are used with 'of':</p>
<p><b>complain, dream, hear, know, learn, read, think, warn, write,  --- , assure, convince, inform, notify, persuade, reassure, remind, warn</b></p>
<ul>
	<li><i>They never complained</i> <b>of the incessant rain</b>.</li>
	<li><i>Mr Beltrami had informed Mr Murray</i> <b>of these developments</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following verbs are used with 'on'. None of them take an object referring to the hearer.</p>
<p><b>agree, comment, decide, determine, insist, remark, report, write</b></p>
<ul>
	<li><i>He had already decided</i> <b>on his story</b>.</li>
	<li><i>She remarked</i> <b>on the excellence of his English</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that 'speak' and 'talk' are used with 'about' and 'of' but not with reported clauses.</p>
