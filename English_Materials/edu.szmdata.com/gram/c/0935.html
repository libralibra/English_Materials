<p class="subTitle">6.9 between subject and verb</p>
<p>Adjuncts can also be placed between the subject and the main verb. This focuses on the adjunct more than when it is at the end of the clause, but not as much as putting it at the beginning of the clause. However, this position is much more common with adverbs than with prepositional phrases.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>I</i> <b>quickly</b> <i>became aware that she was looking at me</i>.</li>
	<li><i>We</i> <b>often</b> <i>swam in the surf</i>.</li>
	<li><i>He</i> <b>carefully</b> <i>wrapped each component in several layers of foam rubber</i>.</li>
	<li><i>They</i> <b>happily</b> <i>tolerated the existence of opinions contrary to their own</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that in verb groups containing auxiliaries, the adjunct is still placed in front of the main verb.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>I had</i> <b>almost</b> <i>forgotten about the trip</i>.</li>
	<li><i>We will</i> <b>never</b> <i>have enough money to provide all the services that people want</i>.</li>
	<li><i>It would not</i> <b>in any case</b> <i>be for him</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Long adjuncts in this position are usually separated by commas from the rest of the clause.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>Fred</i>, <b>in his own way</b>, <i>was a great actor</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Adjuncts of place rarely occur in this position. For more information about adjuncts of place, see the section beginning at paragraph <b>6.53</b>.</p>
<p class="clgm_hw">6.10</p>
<p>Some adjuncts are often placed in front of the main verb:</p>
<p>most adverbs of indefinite frequency (see paragraph <b>5.114</b>)</p>
<ul>
	<li class="c_list"><b>always, constantly, continually, continuously, ever, frequently, hardly ever, never, normally, occasionally, often, rarely, regularly, repeatedly, seldom, sometimes, usually</b></li>
</ul>
<p>some adverbs of indefinite time (see paragraph <b>5.40</b>)</p>
<ul>
	<li class="c_list"><b>again, already, earlier, finally, first, just, last, previously, recently, since</b></li>
</ul>
<p>some adverbs of degree (see paragraph <b>6.45</b>), especially emphasizing adverbs (see paragraph <b>6.49</b>)</p>
<ul>
	<li class="c_list"><b>absolutely, almost, altogether, badly, completely, deeply, entirely, fairly, greatly, largely, nearly, perfectly, quite, rather, really, somewhat, utterly, virtually, well</b></li>
</ul>
<p>focusing adverbs, when modifying a verb: see paragraph <b>10.90</b>.</p>
<ul>
	<li class="c_list"><b>even, just, merely, only, really, simply</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Note that some adjuncts have a different reference when placed in front of the verb rather than at the beginning or end of the clause:</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>The Trade Unions have acted</i> <b>foolishly</b>.</li>
	<li><i>Baldwin had</i> <b>foolishly</b> <i>opened the door</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The first example means that the Unions acted in a foolish way. The second example means that opening the door was a foolish action, and not that the door was opened in a foolish way.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>In some areas, like Islington in London, the drivers are paid</i> <b>generously</b>.</li>
	<li><i>Cram</i> <b>generously</b> <i>admitted afterwards that 'he's still faster than me'</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The first example tells us how well the drivers are paid, the second example indicates that Cram's admission was a generous action.</p>
