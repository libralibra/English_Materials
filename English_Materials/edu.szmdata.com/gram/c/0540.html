<p class="subTitle">3.152 commenting on an event</p>
<p>If you want to express your feeling about an event, you can use a 'to'-infinitive clause after a complement.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>It seemed such</i> <b>a terrible thing to happen</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The 'to'-infinitive consists of 'to' and an intransitive verb, usually 'happen'.</p>
<p>The complement must be a noun group consisting of 'a' or 'an', an adjective, and a noun. You cannot use an adjective in constructions of this kind. For example, you can say 'It was a wonderful thing to happen', but you cannot say 'It was wonderful to happen'.</p>
