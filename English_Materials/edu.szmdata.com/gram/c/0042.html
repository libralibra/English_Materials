<p class="subTitle">1.44 use with modifiers and qualifiers</p>
<p>You do not usually use numbers in front of these nouns. You can, however, use some <b>general determiners</b> such as 'some' or 'many'. For more information about the general determiners which can be used with plural nouns, see the section beginning at paragraph <b>1.208</b>.</p>
<p>Some plural nouns usually have a specific determiner in front of them, because they are specific; some never have a determiner at all, because they are very general; and some are rarely used alone without a modifier or qualifier, because they need supporting material.</p>
<p>The lists in the following two paragraphs contain some common plural nouns which are frequently used in one of these ways. Many of them have other meanings in which they are count nouns.</p>
