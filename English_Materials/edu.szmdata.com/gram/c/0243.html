<p class="subTitle">2.61 two or more adjectives</p>
<p>When you use two adjectives as the complement of a link verb, you use a conjunction, usually 'and', to link them. If you use more than two adjectives as a complement, you usually put a conjunction between the last two adjectives and commas between the others. This is fully explained in paragraphs <b>8.168 to 8.174</b> and paragraph <b>8.189</b>.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>The room was</i> <b>large and square</b>.</li>
	<li><i>We felt</i> <b>hot, tired, and thirsty</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that you put the adjectives in the order that you think is the most important.</p>
