<p class="subTitle">6.91 adding information</p>
<p>There are several structures you can use with indefinite place adverbs in order to give more information. You can use an adverb of place:</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>I would like to work</i> <b>somewhere abroad</b>.</li>
	<li><i>We're certainly</i> <b>nowhere near</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>an adjective:</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>We could go to Majorca if you want</i> <b>somewhere lively</b>.</li>
	<li><i>Are you going</i> <b>somewhere special?</b></li>
</ul>
<p>a prepositional phrase:</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>There were no elms</i> <b>anywhere in sight</b>.</li>
	<li><i>In 1917, Kollontai was the only woman in any government</i> <b>anywhere in the world</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>or a 'to'-infinitive clause:</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>We mentioned that we were looking for</i> <b>somewhere to live</b>.</li>
	<li><i>I wanted to have</i> <b>somewhere to put it</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also use a relative clause. Note that the relative pronoun is usually omitted.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>Unreason is alive and well and living</i> <b>anywhere you care to name</b>.</li>
	<li><b>Everywhere I went</b>, <i>people were angry or suspicious</i>.</li>
</ul>
