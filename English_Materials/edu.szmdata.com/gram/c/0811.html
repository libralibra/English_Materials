<p class="subTitle">5.3 position of adjuncts</p>
<p>Adjuncts of time normally come at the end of a clause, after the verb or after its object if there is one. You can put more focus on the time by placing the adjunct at the beginning of the clause.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>Mr Shamir will visit Washington</i> <b>next month</b>.</li>
	<li><b>Last month</b>, <i>Mr Hurd asked his officials to report back to him</i>.</li>
	<li><i>I was playing golf</i> <b>yesterday</b>.</li>
	<li><b>Yesterday</b> <i>the atmosphere at the factory was tense</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the adjunct is an adverb, it can also come immediately after 'be' or after the first auxiliary in a verb group.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>She</i> <b>is now</b> <i>pretty well-known in this country</i>.</li>
	<li><i>Cooper</i> <b>had originally</b> <i>been due to retire last week</i>.</li>
	<li><i>Public advertisements for the post</i> <b>will soon</b> <i>appear in the national press</i>.</li>
</ul>
