<p class="subTitle">10.65 indicating your attitude</p>
<p>If you want to make it clear what your attitude is to what you are saying, you can use a sentence adjunct.</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Frankly</b>, <i>the more I hear about him, the less I like him</i>.</li>
	<li><b>In my opinion</b> <i>it was probably a mistake</i>.</li>
	<li><b>In fairness</b> <i>it should be said that he cannot be accused of a lack of objectivity</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is a list of some of the common adjuncts used in this way:</p>
<ul>
	<li class="c_list"><b>frankly, honestly, in all honesty, in fairness, in my opinion, in my view, in retrospect, on reflection, personally, seriously, to my mind</b></li>
</ul>
