<p class="subTitle">8.71 non-finite clauses</p>
<p>'Although', 'though', 'while', and 'whilst' are sometimes used in <b>non-finite</b> concessive clauses. For example, instead of saying 'Although he liked cats, he never let them come into his house', you can say 'Although liking cats, he never let them come into his house'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>While</b> <i>conceding the importance of freedom of speech, I believe it must be exercised with sensitivity and responsibility</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>'Despite' and 'in spite of' can also be used at the beginning of non-finite concessive clauses. 'Despite working hard, I failed my exams' means 'Although I worked hard, I failed my exams'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>Sensible, interested mothers still play a big part in their children's lives</i>, <b>despite</b> <i>working and having a full-time nanny</i>.</li>
	<li><i>We had two more years of profit</i> <b>in spite of</b> <i>paying higher wages than the previous owner</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p class="clgm_hw">8.72</p>
<p>'Although', 'though', 'while', and 'whilst' are also used in front of noun groups, adjective groups, and adjuncts. For example, instead of saying 'Although she was fond of Gregory, she did not love him', you can say 'Although fond of Gregory, she did not love him'. Similarly, instead of saying 'They agreed to his proposal, though they had many reservations', you can say 'They agreed to his proposal, though with many reservations'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>It was an unequal marriage</i>, <b>although</b> <i>a stable and long-lasting one</i>.</li>
	<li><b>Though</b> <i>not very attractive physically, she possessed a sense of humour</i>.</li>
	<li><i>They had followed her suggestion</i>, <b>though</b> <i>without much enthusiasm</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>'Even if', 'if', and 'albeit' can also be used in this way. 'Albeit' is a formal word.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>By 1977 things were beginning to improve</i>, <b>even if</b>, <i>in the view of the Royal Air Force, not quickly enough</i>.</li>
	<li><i>...some pleasant</i>, <b>if</b> <i>unexciting, tunes</i>.</li>
	<li><i>Like mercury, lead affects the brain</i>, <b>albeit</b> <i>in different ways</i>.</li>
</ul>
