<p class="subTitle">1.67 Sharing the same quality: adjectives as headwords</p>
<p>When you want to talk about groups of people who share the same characteristic or quality, you often choose an adjective rather than a noun as a headword.</p>
<p>You do this by using the appropriate adjective preceded by 'the'. For example, instead of saying 'poor people', you say 'the poor'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>...the help that's given to</i> <b>the blind</b>.</li>
	<li><i>No effort is made to cater for the needs of</i> <b>the elderly</b>.</li>
	<li><i>...the task of rescuing</i> <b>the injured</b>.</li>
	<li><i>...men and women who would join the sad ranks of</i> <b>the unemployed</b>.</li>
	<li><i>Working with</i> <b>the young</b> <i>is stimulating and full of surprises</i>.</li>
	<li><i>...providing care for</i> <b>the sick</b>, <b>the aged</b>, <b>the workless</b> <i>and</i> <b>the poor</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that you never add '-s' to the headword, even though it always refers to more than one person.</p>
