<p class="subTitle">3.197 USAGE NOTE</p>
<p>With a few verbs, the meaning is altered depending on whether you use a present participle clause or a 'to'-infinitive clause. These verbs are 'come', 'go on', 'remember', and 'regret'.</p>
<p>If someone 'comes running, flying, or hurtling' somewhere, they move in that way. If you 'come to do something', you gradually start doing it.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>When they heard I was leaving, they both</i> <b>came running</b> <i>out</i>.</li>
	<li><i>People</i> <b>came to believe</b> <i>that all things were possible</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>With the other verbs, the difference in meaning relates to the timing of the action.</p>
<p>If you 'go on doing something', you continue to do it, but if you 'go on to do something', you subsequently start doing it.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>We</i> <b>went on fighting</b> <i>the Incomes Policy for 18 months after that</i>.</li>
	<li><i>She</i> <b>went on to talk</b> <i>about the political consequences</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you 'remember doing something', you did it in the past, but if you 'remember to do something', you do it at the present time.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>I</i> <b>remember promising</b> <i>that I would try</i>.</li>
	<li><i>She</i> <b>must remember to get</b> <i>the wood under cover</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Likewise, if you 'regret doing something', you have already done it but if you 'regret to do something', you have to do it at the present time.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>She did not</i> <b>regret accepting</b> <i>his offer</i>.</li>
	<li><i>I</i> <b>regret to say</b> <i>rents went up</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>'Regret' is only used with the 'to'-infinitive of a small number of verbs which share the meaning of giving or receiving information. These verbs are:</p>
<p><b>announce, inform, learn, say, see, tell</b></p>
