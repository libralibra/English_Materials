<p class="subTitle">10.56 Commenting on your statement: sentence adjuncts</p>
<p>There are many adjuncts that are used to indicate your attitude to what you are saying or to make your hearer have a particular attitude to what you are saying. These are dealt with in paragraphs 10.57 to 10.72.</p>
<p>Others are used to show a particular link between sentences. These are dealt with in paragraphs 10.73 to 10.81.</p>
<p>There are also some that are used to make a statement narrower or to focus attention on a particular thing that it applies to. These are dealt with in paragraphs 10.87 to 10.91.</p>
<p>All these adjuncts are called <b>sentence adjuncts</b> because they apply to the whole sentence they are in. They are sometimes called <b>sentence adverbials</b> or <b>disjuncts</b> in other grammars.</p>
<p>Sentence adjuncts are often placed at the beginning of a sentence. Some are also used in other positions, as shown in the examples given below, but they are usually separated from the words around them by intonation or by commas, to show that they apply to the whole sentence.</p>
