<p class="subTitle">3.210 verbs followed by 'for' and a 'to'-infinitive</p>
<p>There is a group of verbs used in phase structures with a 'to'-infinitive which are followed by the preposition 'for' and its object, rather than by a direct object. The object of 'for' is the performer of the second action.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>He</i> <b>arranged for Waddell to have</b> <i>the services of another solicitor</i>.</li>
	<li><i>They</i> <b>called for action to be taken</b> <i>against the unions</i>.</li>
	<li><i>I</i> <b>waited for him to speak</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that the 'to'-infinitive is often a passive one.</p>
<p>Here is a list of verbs which can be used in this way:</p>
<ul>
	<li class="c_list"><b>appeal, apply, arrange, ask, call, clamour, long, opt, pay, plead, press, vote, wait, wish, yearn</b></li>
</ul>
