<p class="subTitle">1.143 'each' as subject</p>
<p>In formal written English, you can also use 'each' as the subject of a clause and 'the other' as the object of a clause or preposition. So a more formal way of saying 'They looked at each other' is 'Each looked at the other'. Note that 'each' is always followed by a singular verb.</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Each</b> <i>is inextricably in the debt of</i> <b>the other</b>.</li>
	<li><b>Each</b> <i>appears to be unwilling to learn from the experience of</i> <b>the others</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>'Each' can also be used as a determiner. For more information about this, see paragraph <b>1.228</b>.</p>
