<p class="subTitle">6.94 adverbs indicating destinations and targets</p>
<p>Adverbs can be used to indicate destinations and targets.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>'I have expected you,' she said, inviting him</i> <b>inside</b>.</li>
	<li><i>No birds or animals came</i> <b>near</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following adverbs are used to indicate destinations or targets:</p>
<ul>
	<li class="c_list"><b>aboard, abroad, ashore, close, downstairs, downtown, heavenward, home, homeward, in, indoors, inland, inside, inward, inwards, near, next door, out of doors, outdoors, outside, overseas, skyward, there, underground, upstairs, uptown</b></li>
</ul>
<p>The comparative forms 'nearer' and 'closer' are more commonly used than 'near' or 'close'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>Come</i> <b>nearer</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>'Deep', 'far', 'high', and 'low' are also used as adverbs indicating a destination or target but only when followed by another adjunct or modified in some other way.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>The dancers sprang</i> <b>high</b> <b>into the air</b> <i>brandishing their spears</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The comparative forms 'deeper', 'further' (or 'farther'), 'higher', and 'lower' are also used, and so is the superlative form 'furthest' (or 'farthest'). These do not have to be followed by another adjunct or modified in another way.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>We left the waterfall and climbed</i> <b>higher</b>.</li>
	<li><i>People have to trek</i> <b>further and further</b> <i>from the villages</i>.</li>
</ul>
