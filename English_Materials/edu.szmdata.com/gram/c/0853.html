<p>When you use the past perfect to describe a repeated event that took place before a particular time in the past, you use an adjunct of frequency to indicate how often it was repeated.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>Posy</i> <b>had always sought</b> <i>her out even then</i>.</li>
	<li><i>The house keeper mentioned that the dog</i> <b>had attacked</b> <i>its mistress</i> <b>more than once</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The use of the past perfect to describe events that occurred before a particular time in the past are explained in paragraph <b>5.37</b>.</p>
<p class="clgm_hw">5.50</p>
<p>If you are using the past perfect to talk about a situation which did not change in the past, you use an adjunct of duration to emphasize the length of time during which it existed.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>They weren't really our aunt and uncle, but we</i> <b>had always known</b> <i>them</i>.</li>
	<li><b>All through those many years</b> <i>he</i> <b>had</b> <i>never ever</i> <b>lost</b> <i>track of my father</i>.</li>
	<li><i>His parents</i> <b>had been married for twelve years</b> <i>when he was born</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p class="clgm_hw">5.51</p>

<ul>

	<li><b>Since then</b>, <i>the mother</i> <b>had been living</b> <i>with her daughter</i>.</li>
