<p class="subTitle">8.119 position of non-finite clauses</p>
<p>Non-defining clauses can go in front of a main clause, after a main clause, or in the middle of one. A non-defining clause is usually separated by a comma from the words in front of it and after it.</p>
<p>Defining clauses always go after a noun group. You never put a comma in front of a defining clause.</p>
