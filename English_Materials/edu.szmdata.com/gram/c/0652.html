<p class="subTitle">4.72 'neither' in replies</p>
<p>'Neither' can be used on its own as a reply, to refer to two alternatives which have already been mentioned.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>'Does that mean Yes or No?' --- </i><b>'Neither'</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p class="clgm_hw">4.73</p>
<p>If a clause contains a negative word, particularly 'not', you can use 'neither' or 'nor' to negate a second clause. In the second clause, you put 'neither' or 'nor' first, followed by the verb, followed by the subject.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>This isn't a dazzling achievement, but</i> <b>neither is it</b> <i>a negligible one</i>.</li>
	<li><i>These people are not insane</i>, <b>nor are they</b> <i>fools</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>If there is an auxiliary, it is placed in front of the subject in the second clause.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>The organization had broken no rules, but</i> <b>neither had it acted</b> <i>responsibly</i>.</li>
	<li><i>I do not wish to be rude to you but</i> <b>neither do I wish</b> <i>to be rude to Simon</i>.</li>
</ul>
