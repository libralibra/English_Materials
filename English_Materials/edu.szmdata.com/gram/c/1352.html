<p class="subTitle">10.82 Indicating a change in a conversation</p>
<p>Sometimes people want to avoid abruptness when changing the topic of conversation, or when starting to talk about a different aspect of it. They do this by using a particular group of sentence adjuncts. These adjuncts are mostly used when you are continuing a conversation, and rarely to begin one.</p>
<p>The following adjuncts are commonly used in this way:</p>
<ul>
	<li class="c_list"><b>actually, anyhow, anyway, by the way, incidentally, look, now, now then, okay, right, so, then, well, well now, well then, you know</b></li>
</ul>
<p>They usually occur at the beginning of a clause. However, a few of them can be used in other places in the clause, when you want to pause or want to draw attention to the fact that you are introducing a new topic.</p>
<p>'Actually', 'anyhow', 'anyway', 'by the way', 'incidentally', and 'you know' can be used at the end of a clause. 'By the way', 'incidentally', and 'you know' can be used after the subject or after the first word in a verb group.</p>
<p>Here are some examples showing adjuncts used to change the topic of a conversation:</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Actually</b>, <i>Dan, before I forget, she asked me to tell you about my new job</i>.</li>
	<li><b>Well now</b>, <i>we've got a very big task ahead of us</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are some examples showing adjuncts used to start talking about a different aspect of the same topic:</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>What do you sell there</i> <b>anyway?</b></li>
	<li><i>This approach</i>, <b>incidentally</b>, <i>also has the advantage of being cheap</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Unlike the other adjuncts, 'then' by itself is not used at the beginning of a clause, only at the end.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>That's all right</i> <b>then</b>.</li>
	<li><i>Are you fond of her</i>, <b>then?</b></li>
</ul>
<p class="clgm_hw">10.83</p>
<p>Some adjuncts are used at the beginning of a clause to introduce a fact, often one that corrects the statement just made. They can also be used at the end of a clause, and elsewhere, to emphasize the fact.</p>
<ul>
	<li class="c_list"><b>actually, as a matter of fact, as it happens, I mean, indeed, in fact</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Note that 'actually' is used here to add information on the same topic, whereas in the previous paragraph it indicated a change of topic.</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Actually</b>, <i>I do know why he made the solicitors write that letter</i>.</li>
	<li><i>He rather envies you</i> <b>actually</b>.</li>
	<li><i>I'm sure you're right</i>. <b>In fact</b>, <i>I know you're right</i>.</li>
	<li><i>There's no reason to be disappointed</i>. <b>As a matter of fact</b>, <i>this could be rather amusing</i>.</li>
	<li><i>They cannot hop or jump</i>. <b>Indeed</b>, <i>they can barely manage even to run</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>'You see' is used to preface or point to an explanation.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>'You don't want to come with me, then?' --- 'No</i>. <b>You see</b>, <i>it's not often that I get the chance to be absolutely free.'</i></li>
	<li><i>Some ran away to Canada and were never heard of again. They couldn't write</i>, <b>you see</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>'After all' is used to preface or point to a reason or justification of what you have just said.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>She did not regret accepting his offer. He was</i>, <b>after all</b>, <i>about the right age</i>.</li>
</ul>
