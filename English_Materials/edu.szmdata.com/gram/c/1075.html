<p class="subTitle">7.68 referring to the speaker</p>
<p>You usually use a reporting verb to report what one person has said or thought, so the subject of a reporting verb is usually a singular noun.</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Henry</b> <i>said that he wanted to go home</i>.</li>
	<li><b>He</b> <i>claimed his health had been checked several times at a clinic</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>When you report the statements, opinions, orders, or questions of a group of people, you can use a plural noun or a collective noun as the subject of the reporting verb.</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>The judges</b> <i>demanded that the race be run again</i>.</li>
	<li><b>The committee</b> <i>also noted that this was not the first case of its kind</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>When you report what was said on television or radio, or what is printed or written in a newspaper or other document, you can mention the source or means of communication as the subject of a reporting verb.</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>The newspaper</b> <i>said Scotland Yard was investigating the crime</i>.</li>
	<li><b>The letter</b> <i>argued that civil defence was an indispensable element of deterrence</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that you can also use 'say' with nouns such as 'sign', 'notice', 'clock', and 'map' as the subject.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>...a notice saying that on no account should the attendants be tipped</i>.</li>
	<li><i>A sign over the door said 'Dreamland Cafe'</i>.</li>
	<li><i>The road map said it was 210 kilometres to the French frontier</i>.</li>
</ul>
