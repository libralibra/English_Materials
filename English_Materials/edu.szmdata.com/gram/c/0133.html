<p class="subTitle">1.149 'whose'</p>
<p>'Whose' shows who or what something belongs to or is connected with. Note that it cannot be used by itself, but must come in front of a noun.</p>
<p>'Whose' is often included with relative pronouns, although it is in fact a kind of possessive determiner. For more information on determiners, see paragraphs <b>1.161 to 1.235</b>.</p>
