<p class="subTitle">3.120 written forms of compound verbs</p>
<p>Compound verbs are usually written with a hyphen.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>No one had</i> <b>cross-referenced</b> <i>the forms before</i>.</li>
	<li><i>Children</i> <b>ice-skated</b> <i>on the sidewalks</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, some compound verbs may be written with a space between the words and some may be written as single words. For example, both 'roller-skate' and 'roller skate' are used, as are 'baby-sit' and 'babysit'.</p>
