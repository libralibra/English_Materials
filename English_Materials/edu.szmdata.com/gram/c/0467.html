<p class="subTitle">3.48 different meanings</p>
<p>One important reason for using verbs in intransitive as well as transitive clauses is that many verbs have more than one common meaning. For example, the verb 'run' is intransitive when it is used in the sense 'to move quickly'. But 'run' is transitive when it is used in the sense 'to manage or operate'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>The hare</i> <b>runs</b> <i>at enormous speed</i>.</li>
	<li><i>She</i> <b>runs a hotel</b>.</li>
	<li><i>She</i> <b>reflected</b> <i>for a moment and then decided to back out</i>.</li>
	<li><i>His ideas</i> <b>reflected the influence of progressive thinkers</b>.</li>
	<li><i>I</i> <b>can manage</b> <i>perfectly well on my own</i>.</li>
	<li><i>I</i> <b>can</b> <i>no longer</i> <b>manage my life</b>.</li>
	<li><i>She</i> <b>moved</b> <i>rather gracefully</i>.</li>
	<li><i>The whole incident</i> <b>had moved her</b> <i>profoundly</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p class="clgm_hw">3.49</p>
