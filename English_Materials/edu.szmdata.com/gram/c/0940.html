<p class="subTitle">6.15 inversion after adjuncts</p>
<p>When clauses begin with an adjunct, the normal order of subject and verb group can sometimes be inverted. For example, after adjuncts of place the verb group usually comes before the subject. For more information about adjuncts of place, see the section beginning at paragraph <b>6.53</b>.</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Next to it</b> <i>stood a pile of paper cups</i>.</li>
	<li><b>Beyond them</b> <i>lay the fields</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>This also happens when <b>broad negative</b> adverbs and some other <b>negative words</b> are placed at the beginning of the clause. For more information about these, see paragraphs <b>4.43 to 4.94</b>.</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Never</b> <i>in history had technology made such spectacular advances</i>.</li>
	<li><b>Seldom</b> <i>can there have been such a happy meeting</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Both these cases of inversion are particularly common in written stories. Inversion can occur after other adjuncts, but only in poetry or old-fashioned English. The following example is from a Christmas carol written in 1853:</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Brightly</b> <i>shone the moon that night, though the frost was cruel</i>.</li>
</ul>
