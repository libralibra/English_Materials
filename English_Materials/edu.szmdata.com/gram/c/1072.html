<p class="subTitle">7.65 use of passives to express general beliefs</p>
<p>If you want to indicate or imply that something is an opinion which is held by an unspecified group of people, you can use a passive form of a reporting verb with 'it' as the <b>impersonal</b> subject.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>It is assumed that the government will remain in power</i>.</li>
	<li><i>In former times it was believed that all enlarged tonsils should be removed</i>.</li>
	<li><i>It is now believed that foreign languages are most easily taught to young children</i>.</li>
	<li><i>It was said that he could speak their language</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is a list of reporting verbs which are used in the passive with 'it' as their subject:</p>
<ul>
	<li class="c_list"><b>accept, acknowledge, admit, agree, allege, announce, argue, assert, assume, believe, claim, comment, concede, conclude, confirm, consider, decide, decree, discover, estimate, expect, explain, fear, feel, find, foresee, forget, guarantee, hold, hope, imply, know, mention, note, notice, object, observe, predict, propose, realize, recall, reckon, recommend, record, remember, report, request, reveal, rule, rumour, say, state, stipulate, suggest, suppose, think, understand</b></li>
</ul>
<p>This structure has much in common with a phase structure using a passive reporting verb and a 'to'-infinitive clause. In the phase structure, the main person or thing involved in the reported opinion is put as the subject of the reporting verb.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>Intelligence is assumed to be important</i>.</li>
	<li><i>He is said to have died a natural death</i>.</li>
	<li><i>He is believed to have fled to France</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that the 'to'-infinitive is most commonly 'be' or 'have', or a perfect infinitive.</p>
<p>Here is a list of reporting verbs, from the list above, which are also used in the phase structure:</p>
<ul>
	<li class="c_list"><b>agree, allege, assume, believe, claim, consider, discover, estimate, expect, feel, find, guarantee, hold, know, observe, predict, reckon, report, rumour, say, think, understand</b></li>
</ul>
