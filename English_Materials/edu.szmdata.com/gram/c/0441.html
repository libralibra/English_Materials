<p class="subTitle">3.14 verbs which are occasionally transitive</p>
<p>There are a small number of verbs which are usually intransitive but which can be transitive when used with one particular object. The object is usually directly related to the verb. For example, 'smile' is usually used intransitively, but you can use it transitively with the noun 'smile'. For example, 'He smiled a patient smile' is a literary alternative to saying 'He smiled patiently'. The focus is on the type of smile rather than on the act of smiling.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>Steve</i> <b>smiled his thin, cruel smile</b>.</li>
	<li><i>He appears to have</i> <b>lived the life of any other rich gentleman</b>.</li>
	<li><i>Alice</i> <b>laughed a scornful laugh</b>.</li>
	<li><i>I once</i> <b>dreamed a very nice dream</b> <i>about you</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is a list of verbs which can only be used transitively when the object is directly related to the verb:</p>
<ul>
	<li class="c_list"><b>dance (a dance), die (a death), dream (a dream), laugh (a laugh), live (a life), sigh (a sigh), smile (a smile)</b></li>
</ul>
<p>A more common way of focusing on the noun group is to use a <b>delexical verb</b> such as 'give', 'take', or 'have', as in 'Mary gave him a really lovely smile'. See paragraphs <b>3.33 to 3.46</b> for more information about the use of delexical verbs.</p>
