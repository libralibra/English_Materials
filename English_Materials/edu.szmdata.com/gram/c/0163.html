<p class="subTitle">1.187 USAGE NOTE</p>
<p>You can indicate that you are referring to the same person or thing you have just mentioned by using 'this', 'that', 'these', or 'those' in front of a noun. For example, if you have just mentioned a girl, you can refer to her as 'this girl' or 'that girl' the second time you mention her. Normally, you use a <b>pronoun</b> to refer to someone or something you have just mentioned, but sometimes you cannot do this because it might not be clear who or what the pronoun refers to.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>Students and staff suggest books for the library, and normally</i> <i>we're quite happy to get</i> <b>those books</b>.</li>
	<li><i>Their house is in a valley. The people in</i> <b>that valley</b> <i>speak</i> <i>about the people in the next valley as 'foreigners'</i>.</li>
	<li><i>They had a lot of diamonds, and they asked her if she could</i> <i>possibly get</i> <b>these diamonds</b> <i>to Britain</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The use of demonstratives to refer again to something which has already been mentioned is fully explained in paragraphs <b>9.7 to 9.10</b>.</p>
<p class="clgm_hw">1.188</p>
<p>In informal English, you can also use 'that' and 'those' in front of a noun to refer to people or things that are already known to the person you are speaking or writing to.</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>That idiot Antonio</b> <i>has gone and locked our cabin door</i>.</li>
	<li><i>They learned how to eat with</i> <b>those horrible chopsticks</b>.</li>
	<li><i>Do you remember</i> <b>that funny little attic apartment?</b></li>
</ul>
<p class="clgm_hw">1.189</p>
<p>You can use 'that' in front of a noun when you are referring to something that has just happened or to something that you have just been involved with.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>I knew</i> <b>that meeting</b> <i>would be difficult</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>'That' is often used as a <b>pronoun</b> to refer to something that has just happened. This use is explained in paragraphs <b>1.123 to 1.126</b>.</p>
