<p class="subTitle">1.113 used with 'of'</p>
<p>Possessive pronouns can be used in prepositional phrases beginning with 'of' to qualify a noun group. This structure suggests that you are talking about one of a group of things.</p>
<p>For example, if you say 'a friend of mine' you are talking about one of a number of friends whereas if you say 'my friend' you are talking about one friend in particular.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>He was an old friend</i> <b>of mine</b>.</li>
	<li><i>A student</i> <b>of yours</b> <i>has just been to see me</i>.</li>
	<li><i>David Lodge? I've just read a novel</i> <b>of his</b>.</li>
	<li><i>It was hinted to him by some friends</i> <b>of hers</b>.</li>
	<li><i>The room was not a favourite</i> <b>of theirs</b>.</li>
</ul>

<p>For other ways of indicating that something belongs to someone or is associated with them, see paragraphs <b>2.180 to 2.192</b>.</p>
