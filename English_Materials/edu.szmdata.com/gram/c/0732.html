<p class="subTitle">4.158 Interacting with other people</p>
<p>You often say things in order to get someone to behave in a particular way. For example, you may want someone to take a particular action, to accept an offer, or to give their permission for something to be done.</p>
<p>In these situations, modals are often used. The modal you choose depends on several factors. The main ones are:</p>
<p>*  the formality or informality of the situation</p>
<p>*  the relationship between yourself and the person you are speaking to</p>
<p>*  the degree of politeness you want to show.</p>
<p>In particular situations, other factors can be important. For example, if you are making an offer or suggestion, the modal you choose may depend on how persuasive you want to be.</p>
