<p class="subTitle">7.50 modals in reported clauses</p>
<p>The basic rules for using modals in reported clauses are as follows.</p>
<p>If the verb in the reporting clause is in a past tense or has 'could' or 'would' as an auxiliary, you usually use 'could', 'might', or 'would' in the reported clause.</p>
<p>If, as is less common, the verb in the reporting clause is in a present tense or has 'can' or 'will' as an auxiliary, you usually use 'can', 'may', or 'will' in the reported clause.</p>
