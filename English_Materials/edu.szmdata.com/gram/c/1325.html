<p class="subTitle">10.54 formal and literary uses</p>
<p>'Exist', 'remain', 'arise', 'follow', and 'come' can be used after 'there' to say that something exists or happens. These structures only occur in formal English or literary writing.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>There remained the matter of Cranston</i>.</li>
	<li><i>There followed a great flood of indignation in the newspapers</i>.</li>
	<li><i>There comes a time when you have to make a choice</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p class="clgm_hw">10.55</p>
<p>Another construction commonly used in literary writing is to begin a sentence with an <b>adjunct of place</b> followed by 'there' and a verb of position or motion.</p>
<p>For example, instead of saying 'The old church stands at the top of the hill', a writer might say 'At the top of the hill there stands the old church'.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>From his hands</i> <b>there dangles</b> <i>a shiny new briefcase</i>.</li>
	<li><i>Beside them</i> <b>there curls up</b> <i>a twist of blue smoke</i>.</li>
</ul>
