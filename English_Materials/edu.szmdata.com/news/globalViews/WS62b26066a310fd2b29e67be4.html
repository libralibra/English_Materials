<p class="storyTitle">Digital Village Initiative to deliver benefits</p>
<p class="storyAuthor">JIN DING/CHINA DAILY</p>
<p>Across Asia and the Pacific, digitalization of rural communities is leading the way to a better future--but the goal is to leave no one behind</p>
<p>It wasn't that long ago that internet connectivity faded the moment one left a populated area such as a city or a big town. "No service" would flash on the phones. But thanks to 3G, 4G and now 5G mobile technology, coupled with widespread installation of cellular towers in rural areas region-wide, that little message shows up less frequently now.</p>
<p>Most importantly, the rapid spread of internet connectivity and mobile telephony, reaching into the most remote rural communities, has resulted in countless opportunities to help address chronic problems such as poverty, malnutrition and inequality.</p>
<p>From farmers to fishers to herders, digital technology is increasingly being relied upon to help transform and enhance livelihoods for hundreds of millions of people every day. From a farmer using a smartphone to check for the optimal conditions in which to sow a field, or rent a drone for making aerial assessments, to a herder using it to check the weather, or a fisher using it to find the best places to cast nets in, digital technologies are becoming increasingly accessible, useful and affordable for those in rural areas. This paradigm shift offers great hope to get the Asia-Pacific region--and the world--back on track to meet the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals.</p>
<p>While this digital revolution sweeping rural areas of Asia and the Pacific holds great promise, not everyone is benefiting equally. In fact, in some cases, digital technologies can even be disruptive, or lead to unintended consequences by widening, not reducing, the digital divide. This needs to be addressed, and it's in everyone's best interests to do so. Policymakers in countries across the region do understand the added value, and they see the economic benefits which digitalization of rural areas brings to their nations and people. Hence, investing in an enabling environment to ensure equal access is the key to ensuring that the benefits of rural digitalization are enjoyed more broadly.</p>
<p>Digital technologies are increasingly applied in countries such as China to boost production and promote sales and rural tourism, among many other applications. Thanks to digitalization, new opportunities are arising for rural industries and these support the goal of an agrifood systems transformation.</p>
<p>Indeed, the move to accelerate implementation of digital technologies equitably across rural areas couldn't have come at a more opportune time. The global COVID-19 pandemic hit rural communities disproportionately hard--particularly individual livelihoods. Now, as we try to recover from the devastation, we are facing the highest prices for many basic foods--the highest we've seen in decades.</p>
<p>Higher food costs hit poorer and marginalized communities in rural areas the hardest as they must spend a greater proportion of their disposable income to feed their families.</p>
<p>These challenges are compounding an already existing and alarming situation. Last year, prior to the inflation of food commodities, the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization and its partners pointed out that many people--at that time--already couldn't afford a healthy diet in Asia and the Pacific.</p>
<p>By leveraging the advancements offered by digital technologies we can find ways to counter some of these and other devastating negative effects that already-existed such as severe weather related events, droughts and floods.</p>
<p>And that is happening. Some countries in this region are well on the road to digitalization of even the smallest and most remote villages and towns. And they have good examples to share with their neighbors.</p>
<p>The FAO has been closely following these trends, policies and initiatives of the member nations in the Asia-Pacific region. It knows the full scale of their desire and determination to embrace, and fully harness, the potential of digitalization. The FAO has pledged to assist in bringing together these existing good practices of its members, and to create a space for others to share their digital solutions as part of the FAO's 1,000 Digital Village Initiative. A key component of this initiative is the Digital Village Knowledge Sharing Platform for the Asia-Pacific that can act as a one-stop village square, where those working in the food and agriculture sectors can share their innovations and technologies with us all.</p>
<p>A digital village isn't necessarily a small place. It is a concept--one that is inclusive, operational, country-led and fit-for-purpose to deliver solid benefits to people.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, the ultimate goal is to make things better for everyone.</p>
<p>Working together, and sharing together, this region's digital village innovations and technologies can help lead us all to a world of better production, better nutrition, better environment and a better life--leaving no one behind.</p>
