<p>Eradication of absolute poverty was the first of the Communist Party of China's two centenary goals--to be accomplished before the CPC celebrates its 100th anniversary of the founding in July. General Secretary of the CPC Central Committee Xi Jinping announced the victory over absolute poverty earlier this year, declaring that a "miracle" had been achieved that would go down in history. Since the birth of the People's Republic of China, the CPC has led more than 1 billion people out of absolute poverty. This extraordinary success has been recognized by the global community including the United Nations, the World Bank and others. Global indicators reflect that as a result of the CPC's tireless efforts, China's overall poverty reduction accounts for nearly three-fourths of the overall global poverty reduction over the past three decades. This achievement could not have been possible without the political, economic and social stability assured by the presence of CPC as a binding force for the nation, the vision and executive capabilities of the CPC leadership and the tens of millions of Party members toiling across the country who support the overall functioning of the government.</p>
<p>With the strong political base created by the CPC, China has been able to have its policies emplaced and implemented with clear prioritization and commitment from not only the CPC but also the government and overall community as a whole. Since its inception the CPC has remained devoted to nation building. Over all these years, the CPC has contributed immensely toward the improvement of people's lives through the focus on the eradication of poverty, better access to healthcare and education, industrialization of the economy, transformation of agriculture and effective use of new technologies thus making comprehensive overall progress. The goal has been fulfilled that China will eliminate extreme poverty by 2020 and create a moderately prosperous society ahead of the 100th anniversary of the foundation of the CPC.</p>
<p>Looking back over the country's huge poverty reduction struggle the commitment of the CPC is evident. Since the inception of the reform and opening-up in the late 1970s, nearly 770 million impoverished people have been given the opportunity to grow with the entire nation.</p>
<p>The poverty reduction accelerated from the 1980s till 2004 during which half a billion people were lifted out of absolute poverty. During this period the economic base was stabilized and revamped.</p>
<p>The 2015 UN Millennium development Goals Report confirmed that the proportion of people living in extreme poverty in China had fallen by half between 1990 and 2002, from 61 percent to below 30 percent, and it had fallen dramatically to 4.2 percent in 2014.</p>
<p>In 2017, President Xi put forward the goal of "rural revitalization "calling it a major strategy that would have a fundamental impact on national livelihoods.</p>
<p>In 2018, the CPC Central Committee and the State Council issued the Strategic Plan for Revitalization of Rural Areas (2018-22) in a bid to foster new growth drivers for rural development. This strategy has been an important road map for efforts to improve the livelihoods of the rural population by adopting new ideas and norms to modernize and capitalize agriculture. It has produced a significant progress in the human development index. The strategy and the targeted poverty alleviation efforts to help overcome the final hurdles of the most entrenched poverty have enabled the historic triumph against poverty to finally be realized. Recently when President Xi announced that absolute poverty had been eradicated in the country, there was a ceremony organized to recognize those CPC members who have worked tirelessly and devoted themselves to ensure no one got left behind on the country's development journey.</p>
<p>The CPC leadership has developed models and road maps for poverty alleviation that have produced best practices and helped transform the administration and governance of the rural areas. Apart from these policies, other programs and actions rolled out by the CPC have focused on curbing corruption, improving rural education and healthcare systems, and ensuring clean drinking water and technologies.</p>
<p>China's poverty alleviation drive is a model for the world, especially for a country like Pakistan. As a long-standing partner and all weather friend, Pakistan can learn from China how the country has shaped its destiny through socioeconomic and political stability. Over the years, Pakistan has faced the dilemma of political challenges and issues of governance, including a surge in corruption, that have created obstacles preventing Pakistan from achieving sustainable economic growth. After many years, after the regular and peaceful cycle of democratic government change of power and the inception of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, there is a light at the end of the tunnel for Pakistan. But for Pakistan to achieve economic and social progress, there needs to be the same commitment and vision as that demonstrated by the Chinese leadership in order to create an environment conducive for people to flourish and utilize their full potential for the country's prosperity.</p>
