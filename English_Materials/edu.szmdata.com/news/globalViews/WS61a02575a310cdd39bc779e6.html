<p>China's entry into the World Trade Organization, in the context of its reform and opening-up policies, has had profound implications for the international trading system, for the prosperity of the Chinese people, and for the country's opening up to the outside world.</p>
<p>China has historically been an important partner for Argentina, and during the last 20 years the two countries have kept pace with the changes that have taken place within the WTO, and within China, with greater cooperation and strengthening of ties between them.</p>
<p>Since joining the WTO, China's growing contribution to global GDP and world trade, and in the reception and generation of investments, has had an impact not only on the world trade system, but also on bilateral trade relations that China maintains with its partners, as has been the case with the changes in the economic-trade relations between Argentina and China in the past decades.</p>
<p>Commercial exchanges between China and Argentina have registered notable growth in recent years. Since 2010, China has been Argentina's second-largest trading partner, while for some months in 2019 and 2020, it ranked first, surpassing Brazil, which has traditionally occupied that position. In turn, in 2020, China represented approximately 10 percent of Argentina's total exports ($54.9 billion) and about 20 percent of its imports ($42.4 billion).</p>
<p>In this context, it is worth noting that bilateral trade between the two countries stands out for its broad sectoral nature, and for the existence of a wide potential for the expansion and diversification of traded goods and services, as can be seen in the increasing participation of Argentine technology companies in fairs and initiatives in China, and the greater Chinese presence in various sectors of Argentine development. In 2020, Argentina ranked eighth among China's agro-industrial suppliers, and second among Latin American countries.</p>
<p>The agri-food sector is strategic for the economic and social development of both Argentina and China, and has great growth potential. Argentina is recognized worldwide as a leading country of food production, with high levels of productivity, quality and safety, as well as a long tradition of innovation in the sector.</p>
<p>In the last 20 years, important changes have also been made in terms of diversification in both countries, as new products have been incorporated into the commercial relationship. As an example, the number of tariff positions traded went from 65 in 2001 to 157 in 2020, thanks to the shared efforts that are being made to achieve a greater exchange of quality goods and services that serve for the development of prosperous societies in both countries, using a win-win approach.</p>
<p>This expansion of their commercial exchanges has been registered in a broader framework, the Comprehensive Strategic Partnership, where Argentina and China have agreed to strengthen their cooperation on a wide range of issues, ranging from commerce and finance, to key sectors such as science and technology, energy, nuclear power, mining, renewable energy and infrastructure, among others. Like China, Argentina recognizes the importance of cooperation and integrated economic systems that bring benefits to all countries.</p>
<p>Argentina also recognizes and salutes the path that China has undertaken throughout the two decades since it joined the WTO in pursuit of the development of its economy, as well as in pursuit of the strengthening of the WTO.On the one hand, China has actively improved the business framework for trade, through a series of measures such as the development of pilot free trade zones, the reduction of its negative lists and the expansion of market access for companies with foreign financing. On the other hand, it has not only contributed an immense number of dedicated lawyers, specialists and academics to the WTO, but also participated constructively in its various committees and bodies, presenting their ideas and listening to those of others.</p>
<p>China has shown itself to be a responsible actor in the international arena, with principles that we share, such as support for multilateralism, and has played a crucial cooperative and supportive role during the COVID-19 pandemic. China and Argentina must continue to live up to these unique and challenging times, in pursuit of greater food security, clear trade rules, the promoting of innovation, and the greater incorporation of technology, especially in developing countries.</p>
<p>In this sense, the last 20 years with China as a member of the WTO have provided Argentina with an example of the way forward to strengthen the international trading system: active and constructive participation, nondiscrimination between countries and a spirit of cooperation among nations, seeking mutual development and not imposing one's own interests at the expense of others.</p>
