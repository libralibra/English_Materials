<p class="storyAuthor">China's vaccine aid has empowered the inoculation efforts of the less-developed countries</p>
<p>A celebratory mood continues to grow in one of the world's major economies, as the Communist Party of China prepares to commemorate the 100th anniversary of its founding on July 1. The CPC has demonstrated its strong leadership throughout the historical process of leading the people toward the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. It has not only significantly improved the lives of the Chinese people, but also provided new opportunities and driving forces for the development of the whole world.</p>
<p>The CPC's insistence on putting people and life first is the guiding principle that has enabled China to achieve success in largely containing the COVID-19 pandemic and in experiencing a robust economic recovery under the CPC's leadership. Chinese people united all resources to win the battle against the deadly coronavirus by effectively and efficiently controlling its transmission and China was the first nation to restore normal levels of economic and financial activities in the presence of a global pandemic. China's rapid response to the COVID-19 outbreak and the rigid pandemic control measures taken to win the fight against the virus has once again highlighted the unique nature and advantages of the Chinese political system. The CPC's "people first" philosophy is reflected in the nation's emphasis on reducing the infection and mortality rates not only in China but around the world.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding China's control and exceptional management of the coronavirus, large-scale investment, research and development have been carried out by Chinese corporations to aid the world in the fight against the virus. China has made huge strides in the development and production of two front-runner vaccines: Sinovac and Sinopharm. The World Health Organization's endorsement of both vaccines has promoted China to play a leading role in the world's fight against the pandemic. The country's pandemic response is an embodiment of President Xi Jinping's governing philosophy.</p>
<p>The mass vaccine deployment by China has eased global shortages. As the world's poorest nations have been lagging behind and struggling to vaccinate a tiny percentage of their population, the Chinese government has generously distributed vaccines to these nations. This vaccine aid has empowered the inoculation efforts of the less-developed countries around the world thereby reducing rates of transmission and by extension, saving the lives of their people. The Chinese government has gifted the twin islands of Trinidad and Tobago 100,000 vaccines which has allowed an advancement in the country's vaccination drive.</p>
<p>Aside from its robust economic performance amid the global pandemic, China continues to play an important role in the world economy. Its rapid recovery has reaffirmed the toughness and resilience of the Chinese economy. China's development and participation in the global economy offers opportunities for trade, investment and international cooperation to promote world prosperity and stability. Led by the CPC, China has won its long struggle to eliminate extreme poverty in the country. Despite the enormous challenges faced by China, the world's second-largest economy has lifted over 800 million people out of poverty. This is a remarkable and unprecedented global achievement. Further, China's urbanization has also been phenomenal with a large proportion of people moving from the rural to urban areas and experiencing a better standard of living.</p>
<p>China continues to make great strides despite the pandemic. Direct assistance to low-income countries through China's international aid mechanism, distributions of vaccines, manufacturing and construction sector developments as well as qualified technical support demonstrates the good faith of the CPC. China is developing on all fronts at a rapid pace and the nation's impact on the world continues to accelerate.</p>
