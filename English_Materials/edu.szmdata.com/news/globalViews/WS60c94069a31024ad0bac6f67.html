<p class="storyTitle">Celebrating two centenaries</p>
<p class="storyAuthor">MA XUEJING/CHINA DAILY</p>
<p>"In times of crisis, friends always rise," so goes a popular Arabic proverb, but I am sure there is an equivalent in every culture on earth, because this is human nature and this is how the human race has survived throughout history.</p>
<p>I was among the lucky ones who got a chance to watch on the ground how China managed to contain the novel coronavirus outbreak in the most effective and efficient way. It also gave me a chance to see solidarity galvanizing across the nation to help Wuhan and protect the rest of the country.</p>
<p>It was a test of the nation's spirit, and the country's system, and above all, a manifestation of the wisdom and resolve of the Chinese leadership. And the result was a complete success and an example for the rest of the world.</p>
<p>It was also pleasing to see the solidarity extended to China by other countries, and how supplies poured into China from every corner of the world, including Jordan, from friends who stood up and sent the message that China was not alone.</p>
<p>That's why it has not been surprising to see China at the forefront, helping other nations in their battles with the novel coronavirus. This pandemic was and is a tragic catastrophe for the world, but it also showcases human solidarity and how the world needs to come together as one to face such a challenge.</p>
<p>Jordan is among the countries that has received China's help and support. The medical supplies that were donated to Jordan both from the Chinese government and China's private sector have touched every Jordanian's heart and they have been received with gratitude and appreciation. Cooperation is continuing in the field of vaccines, thus bringing more warmth to the relations, and more strength to the bonds of friendship.</p>
<p>Fighting against the pandemic is not the only challenge that humanity is facing. The list of Sustainable Development Goals set by the United Nations not only identifies the most serious challenges of our time, but also makes it clear that cooperation is inevitable for countries if they want to survive those challenges.</p>
<p>Having been in China for two years, I witnessed with admiration the results achieved by China in addressing the SDGs. The measures and policies framed in order to control the pandemic represent a landmark achievement on China's march toward fulfilling its obligation under the SDG on Health. Its help and assistance to other countries are also contributing to global efforts in this regard. It is worthwhile mentioning that another milestone was reached last year when China succeeded in eradicating extreme poverty in the country, 10 years ahead of the UN's deadline, an achievement for humanity as much as it is for China.</p>
<p>This year marks the centennial anniversary of the establishment of Jordan, a journey of 100 years of achievements that transformed Jordan into a modern country and an oasis of stability.</p>
<p>With a long history of relations going back more than 2,000 years, when the Silk Road connected the Kingdom of Petra with China, Jordan stands proud of the excellent relations between the two countries and their peoples. The deepening relations in almost every field are a testimony to this special friendship, and to the common and shared values of both nations.</p>
<p>It is a good omen that this occasion coincides with the centennial anniversary of the Communist Party of China, another successful story of great achievements that created modern China, putting this great nation at the doorway to the future.</p>
<p>To walk the path for 100 years, and still be committed to the core values and principles of a nation's renaissance, cannot be achieved without a wise and determined leadership, that puts the people at the core of its interest, and the nation's prosperity at the heart of its pursuit. That is the story of Jordan under the Hashemite Leadership, and that is the story of China under the CPC and its eminent leaders.</p>
<p>The special and close friendship between King Abdullah II and President Xi Jinping continues to nurture the excellent and growing relations between Jordan and China. It helped pave the way for the upgrading of relations to a strategic partnership in 2015. Today, China is Jordan's second-largest trading partner, and there is great potential for expanded cooperation in trade, investment, tourism, culture and many other different fields.</p>
<p>As Jordan celebrates its centennial anniversary this year, it also celebrates the special relations and long-standing friendship with China. It extends its best wishes for continued success and prosperity to the great nation of China, to the CPC and to its esteemed leadership with President Xi at its core.</p>
