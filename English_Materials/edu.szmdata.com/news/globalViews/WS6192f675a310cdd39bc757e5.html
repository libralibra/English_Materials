<p class="storyAuthor">LI MIN/CHINA DAILY</p>
<p>China continues to inject momentum for the realization of a community with a shared future for mankind</p>
<p>President Xi Jinping said recently that every choice and move we make today will shape the world of the future. These are wise words because the world is indeed changing. The outbreak of the novel coronavirus has further demonstrated the fragility of our world, exposing risks we have steadily ignored.</p>
<p>In this increasingly globalized world, the challenges we face are becoming increasingly integrated. Sadly, the global responses to these challenges are becoming more fragmented than ever before. If this situation is not addressed, it will spell doom for future global growth, development and stability. United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres recently posed a pertinent question: "Will we succumb to chaos, division and inequality? Or will we right the wrongs of the past and move forward together, for the good of all?"</p>
<p>In fact, the question posed by Guterres echoed what President Xi had said: "In the face of common challenges, no person or country can remain insulated. The only way out is to work together in harmony with one accord."</p>
<p>China is stepping up to the plate as a responsible global citizen by advocating that there is no other way to deal with global challenges, other than with coordinated global responses organized in a multilateral way. Its diplomacy with its expanding agenda, under the banner of peace, development and win-win cooperation, is increasingly advocating reform of the global governance system and in the process promoting the building of a community with a shared future for mankind to promote and safeguard a "better world".</p>
<p>To build a community with a shared future for mankind is a highly commendable concept proposed by President Xi. Adopted by the CPC, it represents China's strategic vision of the world in a new era and of a fair and equitable global order built upon the spirit of openness, inclusiveness, fairness and mutual respect.</p>
<p>It is to be welcomed that the constructive concept of a community with a shared future for mankind, which can also be called "China's plan for the world", has become the guiding principle of China's foreign policy and is characterized by the following:</p>
<p>It represents an exciting new perspective for international cooperation and an international order that features fresh concepts of development, security and civilization. It underlines China's strategic thought on the long-term development of its bilateral and multilateral ties with the world.</p>
<p>The proposal also reflects and supports the long-cherished aspirations of not only the Chinese people, but very importantly also the common yearning of people all over the world to live in peace, security and with prosperity.</p>
<p>It emphasizes that the concept is deeply rooted in the Chinese civilization. President Xi has on many occasions called for the enrichment of a community with a shared future with the positive values of the way of life in Chinese culture.</p>
<p>It reflects China's approach of embracing the world in an open and inclusive manner, bringing more progress and prosperity to itself and the rest of the world.</p>
<p>This concept is increasingly being recognized by the international community, inter alia, the United Nations because it offers a practical, sensible and imperative route for the ongoing international efforts to improve global governance, development and security. It also gives the concept of globalization a much more humane and compassionate content by bringing greater benefits to all peoples of the world in a more just manner.</p>
<p>It is inevitable that China will actively continue to be a provider of much needed economic dynamism and a key driver for inclusive and equitable global governance. China's unwavering commitment to promote sustainable development by establishing long-term and mutually beneficial partnerships globally will increasingly serve as a potent stabilizing force in the world.</p>
<p>The Belt and Road Initiative is an essential and integral part of a community with a shared future for mankind and will play a vital role in achieving a win-win situation and shared development globally. In fact, a community with a shared future is the ultimate objective of the Belt and Road Initiative, which is a concrete manifestation of the spirit of China wanting to share its expertise, experiences and benefits with the world and in particular with the less privileged.</p>
<p>China's approach, which will continue to inject growing momentum into world peace and development, is therefore appreciated by the international community as it will continue to contribute significantly to a better world. The building of a community with a shared future for mankind thus effectively encapsulates the common dream of all countries and people around the world not only to live under harmonious and prosperous conditions at home but also in a peaceful and stable international environment.</p>
<p>The rise of China is therefore indeed good news for the world.</p>
