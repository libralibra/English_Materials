<p>China-Costa Rica ties hold great potential and bright prospects in the post-pandemic era</p>
<p>The first batch of Chinese people set foot on Costa Rica, a Central American country that means "rich coast" in Spanish, more than 160 years ago. Those people pioneered friendly exchanges between the two sides until June 1, 2007, when China and Costa Rica first established diplomatic relations, making the latter the first Central American country to establish diplomatic ties with China in the 21st century.</p>
<p>With the joint efforts of both sides, China-Costa Rica relations have flourished and set many "firsts" in relations between China and the Latin America and the Caribbean region. The China-Costa Rica Free Trade Agreement came into force in August 2011, becoming the first of its kind between China and a Central American country. In January 2015, the two countries established a strategic partnership featuring equality, mutual trust and win-win cooperation, and Costa Rica became China's first strategic partner in Central America. In December 2019, Costa Rica's Legislative Assembly passed a law on marking the "Day of Chinese Culture", the first of its kind in the Latin America and the Caribbean region.</p>
<p>Since the establishment of diplomatic relations, the leaders of the two states have maintained close contact, guiding the in-depth development of bilateral relations from a strategic and long-term perspective. In June 2013, President Xi Jinping chose Costa Rica as an important stop on his first trip to the Americas.</p>
<p>After the COVID-19 pandemic cases were first reported in China, Costa Rican President Carlos Alvarado Quesada expressed his solidarity. And Costa Rica took the lead in donating anti-pandemic goods to China among countries in the region. Later, China organized three video meetings to share its anti-virus experience and help Costa Rican researchers develop therapeutic drugs. Governments at all levels, enterprises, social organizations in China as well as Chinese compatriots in Costa Rica have donated a large number of anti-pandemic goods to the Central American country.</p>
<p>As firm supporters and practitioners of multilateralism, the two countries maintain good communication and coordination on issues such as global governance and climate change, jointly safeguard the international system with the United Nations as its core and the international order based on international law, uphold multilateralism and promote the construction of a community with a shared future for mankind.</p>
<p>Thanks to agreements on free trade and investment protection, the China-Costa Rica economic and trade ties are growing closer. China has been Costa Rica's second-largest trading partner for years. Chinese brands such as Huawei, Xiaomi, and Midea have gained popularity among Costa Rican users. China's Geely, Great Wall and BYD cars can be seen everywhere in the Central American country.</p>
<p>Statistics show that the type of goods Costa Rica exports to China has increased from 10 plus at the time of the establishment of diplomatic ties to more than 200 now and its exports to China have increased by nearly 721 percent. Thanks to such exports, high-quality coffee, pork and dairy products have been served on Chinese people's dining tables.</p>
<p>China has always tried its utmost to support Costa Rica's national development and help improve local people's livelihoods. Multiple China-aided projects, including the National Stadium, a national police college and an urban water supply plant in Costa Rica have become witnesses of their friendship. Not long ago, China also announced that it would donate six electric buses to Costa Rica, jointly practicing the green development concept.</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese people in Costa Rica have actively assimilated with the local community and outstanding Chinese talents are working in all walks of life there. Chinese cuisine, customs and culture continue to enrich Costa Rica's culture. In 2020, the Costa Rican government listed Chinese as one of the six foreign languages in its bilingual promotion strategy.</p>
<p>Ten public middle schools are offering Chinese language courses, and the Confucius Institute at the University of Costa Rica is well received by local teachers and students.</p>
<p>Popular Chinese dramas and documentaries such as The Qin Empire, Mr Right and Heroes in Harm's Way have been shown on Costa Rica's TV channels. Various activities, such as exchange visits of cultural groups, online shows and exhibitions, help enhance cultural exchanges and mutual understanding of the two peoples despite long distance between them.</p>
<p>The two sides have been promoting visa facilitation measures to better unleash the potential of tourism cooperation after the pandemic. Beijing-San Jose, Qinghai-Cartago, Shanxi-Heredia, Fuzhou-Limon and many other pairs of sister cities and sister provinces have helped each other fight the virus, which has become a vivid embodiment of China-Costa Rica ties.</p>
<p>In Costa Rica, the age of 15 is a landmark age for teenagers to bid farewell to their childhood and become adults. On the 15th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic ties, the China-Costa Rica relations, too, hold great potential and bright prospects. It is believed that the bilateral relations, which have entered a mature period, will continue to deepen and consolidate and better benefit the two peoples with the diplomatic guidance of the two heads of state and joint efforts of both sides.</p>
