<p class="storyTitle">Flourishing Silk Road friendship</p>
<p class="storyAuthor">MA XUEJING/CHINA DAILY</p>
<p>China and Iran are ancient civilizations at the eastern and western ends of Asia. Although the two countries are separated by mountains and rivers, they have enjoyed friendly exchanges through the Silk Road since ancient times. The two ancient civilizations have learned from each other and jointly made important contributions to the progress of human civilization for thousands of years. In 1971, the two countries established diplomatic relations. In 2016, President Xi Jinping paid a successful visit to Iran and the two sides established a comprehensive strategic partnership, opening a new historical chapter in their bilateral relations.</p>
<p>As an ancient Chinese saying goes, even mountains and seas cannot separate people with common aspirations. More than 2,000 years ago, Gan Ying, an envoy of the Han Dynasty (206 BC-AD 220), came to Parthia, an empire occupying what is now Iran, opening up China's route to Rome, the ancient Silk Road.</p>
<p>Friendly exchanges between the two countries have continued since the king of Parthia sent envoys to pay a return visit. In the 13th century, the famous Iranian poet Sady recorded his memorable trip to Kashgar in China's Xinjiang. In the 15th century, the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) navigator Zheng He voyaged seven times with a huge fleet, three of which reached Hormuz in southern Iran.</p>
<p>The two countries have jointly made great contributions to the development and integration of the world civilization. China's silk, porcelain, tea, paper-making, metallurgy, printing, gunpowder and other technologies arrived in Iran through the Silk Road, and then spread to Europe and other farther places. Pomegranates, grapes, olives, spinach and other plants, as well as glass, gold and silver utensils and musical instruments were brought to China from Iran and Europe, which had a far-reaching impact on future generations.</p>
<p>Representatives of China and Iran signed a joint communique in 1971 in Islamabad, Pakistan, marking the official establishment of diplomatic ties. Since then, the bilateral friendly cooperation in various fields has continuously reached new heights, and their moving forward side by side and helping each other in history have been remembered.</p>
<p>Over the past half century, political mutual trust between China and Iran has been deepening, with their traditional friendship strengthened over time. Chinese President Xi said that no matter how the international and regional situation changes, China will unswervingly develop friendly relations with Iran when he talked with his Iranian counterpart Ebrahim Raisi on the phone last August.</p>
<p>History has proved that China-Iran relations have withstood the vicissitudes of the international situation. The two countries firmly support each other in safeguarding national sovereignty and national dignity, as well as the development path they have chosen. They have firmly supported each other over issues related to their core interests and major concerns, greatly consolidated China-Iran strategic mutual trust, and safeguarded international fairness and justice with conviction.</p>
<p>Over the past half century, China-Iran economic and trade exchanges have developed steadily and their pragmatic cooperation has yielded fruits. Their economies are highly complementary, and there is huge space for cooperation. The two countries are devoted to promoting the Belt and Road Initiative and boast broad prospects for cooperation in various fields.</p>
<p>China has been Iran's largest trading partner for many years. In 2021, the two sides signed the comprehensive cooperation plan which is a long-term program to release the potential for economic cooperation and in other fields, further develop and upgrade the China-Iran comprehensive strategic partnership, and better benefit both countries and their peoples.</p>
<p>Over the past half century, the two countries' cultural ties have become closer, and people-to-people exchanges have been strengthened. As a Chinese poem goes, distance cannot divide true friends who feel close even if they are thousands of miles apart. There is also a poem in Iran that mountains are not linked by road, but hearts are connected with hearts. Both Chinese civilization and Persian civilization have existed for thousands of years, and the two brilliant civilizations have been constantly fascinating, interacting and influencing each other, contributing a splendid chapter to the history of world civilization.</p>
<p>Since the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Iran, exchanges and cooperation in culture and education, health, the media, publishing, tourism and other fields have continued to expand, and the two peoples have gained better understandings of each other. The Silk Road Spirit featuring peace and cooperation, openness and inclusiveness, mutual learning and win-win results is gaining new vitality.</p>
<p>Over the past half century, the two countries have always been supporting and helping each other through thick and thin. As an ancient poem observes, the pines and cypresses know winter; adversity brings true friendship. Despite the "extreme pressure" of the United States on Iran, China has unswervingly developed the China-Iran comprehensive strategic partnership and supported Iran's legitimate rights and interests.</p>
<p>At the critical moment of China's anti-COVID-19 fight, Iran was the first country to voice its support for China. As the pandemic spread in Iran, the Chinese government, social organizations, enterprises and ordinary people also extended helping hands to Iran and provided a large amount of material and medical assistance. In addition, China sent the first volunteer medical expert team to Iran to help the country fight the virus. Facing the challenge brought by the pandemic, China and Iran have supported and helped each other, demonstrating their strong and solid partnership. The Chinese side will continue to make efforts to provide vaccines to Iran and help it conquer the pandemic.</p>
<p>China-Iran relations stand at a new historical moment connecting the past and the future. Facing complex and severe challenges last year, both countries took the 50th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations as an opportunity to strengthen their unity and cooperation and deepen mutual political trust under the guidance of the two heads of state.</p>
<p>At the beginning of this year, Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi held talks with Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir Abdollahian in Wuxi, Jiangsu province in East China. The two sides announced the launch of the comprehensive cooperation plan, and agreed to step up their cooperation on energy, infrastructure, production capacity, science and technology, and medical and healthcare. They also agreed to expand cooperation in agriculture, fisheries and cybersecurity, and promote cooperation, and deepen people-to-people and cultural exchanges in education, film and personnel training to create more tangible results.</p>
<p>Both China and Iran are countries with a long history of civilization and important influence. Deepening bilateral relations is in line with the traditional friendship between the two sides and the interests of the two peoples. It is an integral part of the China-Iran comprehensive strategic partnership and helps maintain regional and world peace and stability.</p>
<p>China will enhance dialogue with Iran, expand cooperation in various fields and raise the bilateral strategic partnership to a new level. It firmly opposes any illegal unilateral sanctions against Iran, political manipulation on issues such as human rights, and gross interference in the internal affairs of countries like Iran and other regional countries.</p>
<p>The two sides will continue to firmly support each other and defend their core interests, hold high the banner of multilateralism, oppose hegemonism and power politics, and safeguard the basic norms of international relations as well as international fairness and justice.</p>
<p>The Chinese government will provide firm support to the negotiation on the resumption of the implementation of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action and continue to participate constructively in the follow-up negotiations. It hopes that all parties will overcome the difficulties and stick to advancing the political and diplomatic settlement process.</p>
<p>At a new historical starting point, China will work with Iran to deeply implement the important consensus of the two heads of state, strengthen communication and coordination, constantly enrich the connotations of the China-Iran comprehensive strategic partnership, and open a new era for the development of bilateral relations in the next 50 years.</p>
