<p>China's experience is a boon for the global efforts to eradicate poverty</p>
<p>As the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China commenced successfully in Beijing, nations worldwide celebrated the 30th International Day for the Eradication of Poverty on Oct 17, with the theme "Dignity for All in Practice". At the same time, China has also marked its ninth Poverty Alleviation Day, on which it was able to commemorate the achievement of the goal of eradicating extreme poverty and uplifting the lives of more than 800 million people across China, hence creating a moderately prosperous society in all respects.</p>
<p>The World Bank also issued a comprehensive Poverty and Shared Prosperity Report 2022, indicating that due to the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a deceleration in global poverty reduction efforts worldwide. However, China has contributed not only to the eradication of extreme poverty in China, but also by achieving a critical Sustainable Development Goal way ahead of the scheduled timeline, it has contributed tremendously toward the global poverty eradication drive.</p>
<p>The CPC has provided in-depth direction, wisdom and leadership that have made it possible for the country to achieve its goals. In the 100 years since the founding of the CPC, it has guided the country to become a moderately prosperous society in all respects and led the ushering in of a new era of socialism with Chinese characteristics.</p>
<p>All these milestones are interlinked. Like the whole-process people's democracy, the hallmark of the CPC's governance and policymaking has consistently evolved over the past 100 years. This consistency has not been static in its philosophy and it has been a dynamic process adapting to China's changes and transformations by keeping in view the local realities and finding solutions to them. Focusing on the people and their well-being has not only resulted in socialism with Chinese characteristics thriving but also made it possible to help people have a prosperous future with a shared destiny.</p>
<p>While reviewing the Chinese process of poverty eradication and its techniques, it is clear that the entire system is based on scientific and organized approaches that ensure an understanding of the causes and solving them with strategies and solutions. All the existing progress in poverty reduction was made possible through skill development, education, knowledge, effective use of technology, and the latest methods for improving lives and livelihoods in poverty-ridden places.</p>
<p>China recently launched the Global Development Initiative, focusing on poverty reduction and food security. Subsequently, a Global Alliance for Poverty Reduction and Development and an International NGOs Network for Poverty Reduction Cooperation have been formed. These facilitate the sharing of China's poverty eradication measures and alleviation experience with other countries and organizations, helping local communities to devise strategies and arrive at local solutions.</p>
<p>According to World Bank statistics, China's poverty eradication initiative has impacted nearly 70 percent of the global population. The World Bank has also projected that through Chinese initiatives such as the Belt and Road Initiative, it is expected that nearly 7.6 million people will be lifted out of extreme poverty and 32 million out of moderate poverty in the partner countries by 2030. So primarily, prosperity is homegrown and shared with the global population.</p>
<p>Pakistan has been an important beneficiary of China's poverty eradication drive, especially with the implementation of the Belt and Road Initiative and the inception of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, which have helped the country pursue a phased development process. The CPEC has transformed the lives of communities across the length and breadth of Pakistan since its inception. It has created greater access to local communities' markets, education, knowledge, information and technology. Even during the recent devastating floods in Pakistan, the infrastructure made as a result of the CPEC has helped save millions of lives.</p>
<p>Over the years, China has made it possible that no country, no community, and no one should be left behind in achieving prosperity. China has made it clear that it will uphold and advance the global poverty reduction drive by supporting the international community and supporting countries to build lives by strengthening communities of shared future for mankind.</p>
