<p class="storyTitle">Cooperation or conflict</p>
<p class="storyAuthor">CAI MENG/CHINA DAILY</p>
<p>Despite the US picking a quarrel with it, China is loath to come to blows</p>
<p>The first high-level meeting of the new US administration and China held in Anchorage, Alaska, regrettably resulted in a bitter exchange of words. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken from the outset launched a scathing and inappropriate attack on China in a condescending manner. He highlighted "the deep concern of the US with actions by China" in regard to Hong Kong, Taiwan and the Uygur ethnic group in the Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region.</p>
<p>The Chinese delegation, determined to safeguard its legitimate interests, adopted a resolute tone in response. It did, however, firmly emphasize that China does not seek conflict or confrontation with the United States and that it is willing to cooperate.</p>
<p>A key element of the Joe Biden administration's China strategy is to build a "united front" of what it calls "democratic allies "against China. The United Kingdom and Canada soon decided to impose sanctions against a number of Chinese officials and an entity allegedly involved in the "violation of human rights" of the Uygur ethnic group in Xinjiang. To defend its interests, China imposed sanctions on a number of US, UK and Canadian politicians, civil rights organizations and entities directly involved in escalating the "lies and false information" about the situation in Xinjiang.</p>
<p>This provoked outrage despite it being a legitimate response. In Europe it resulted in a threat to put on ice the proposed comprehensive EU-China investment agreement that was agreed upon in December 2020. The European business sector is expressing deep concern about this move which they regard as counterproductive. Given the significant size of EU investment and trade with China, many observers predict that a suspension of the agreement would have a much more damaging impact on the EU economy than on that of China.</p>
<p>Tensions have therefore escalated and it is a matter of concern to many countries worldwide that the US in its strong reaction once again alluded to "genocide" in Xinjiang. This constitutes a grave allegation for which there is a lack of any concrete and credible evidence.</p>
<p>These allegations by the US and certain of its allies about Xinjiang are justifiably rejected by China as "lies and fabricated propaganda". The Xinjiang-related issues are in essence about countering violent terrorism and de-radicalization, a fact that is conveniently ignored by the US and others. It should be noted that the extremist East Turkistan Islamic Movement operating in Xinjiang with the aim of establishing an "independent Turkistan" in China, has officially been designated as a "terrorist movement" by the United Nations Security Council, in accordance with Resolution 1267. There is a standing invitation by China to the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights to visit Xinjiang for the purpose of promoting "exchanges and cooperation" rather than to conduct a so-called investigation based on "presumption of guilt" as hypocritically advocated by many Western countries.</p>
<p>Africa, as is the case in various other regions around the globe, has noted the remarkable economic and social progress that China has achieved over the last few decades including in Xinjiang where the Uygur population continues to grow. These countries overwhelmingly view the Western allegations as complete lies, fabricated with ulterior motives and as nothing but an attempt to impede the remarkable development progress of China. Such fraudulent allegations are also used by Western countries in regard to Hong Kong and Taiwan to undermine China's sovereignty.</p>
<p>It is an unequivocal fact that the international community predominantly believes that China and the US, as leading members of international community, should work together. There is growing international concern over the potential negative implications for global growth, stability and peace, arising from the escalating feud between the US and China.</p>
<p>The overriding reason for this is the key role that China plays in the global economy as well as its impressive recovery which is adding significant momentum to future global economic growth.</p>
<p>Cooperation between the world's two largest economies would undoubtedly have a beneficial impact on global peace, stability, the resuscitation of the global economy and multilateral cooperation.</p>
<p>The international community has also noted the commendable proposals put forward by President Xi Jinping at the virtual Davos Agenda event of the World Economic Forum in January in which he pledged that China will "take an active part in international cooperation on COVID-19" and continue to promote sustainable development as well as a new type of international relations.</p>
<p>It is against this background that the international community increasingly poses the question: When will the US realize that containment of China is a "pipe dream" and that sustained efforts in this regard are detrimental to global peace and stability?</p>
<p>Thus, despite all the US actions and the heightened tensions, China, in principle, remains ready to resume dialogue with the US, on the basis of mutual respect, good faith and non-interference in each other's domestic affairs. It would be most helpful, indeed, if the US would also discard its Cold War mentality, "interventionist" policies abroad and cease spreading fabricated lies and propaganda on issues such as Xinjiang.</p>
