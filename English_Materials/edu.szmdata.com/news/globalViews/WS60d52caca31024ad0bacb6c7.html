<p class="storyAuthor">Resolute efforts of the CPC have been a key factor in successfully eliminating abject poverty</p>
<p>As the Communist Party of China is going to celebrate its 100th anniversary, it is a good opportunity for the world to rethink China's outstanding experience in poverty alleviation.</p>
<p>It is well known that when the People's Republic of China was founded in 1949, China was one of the most underdeveloped countries in the world.</p>
<p>With the proclamation of the PRC, the country entered into a new era - an era of development. Development was set on Mao Zedong Thought of common prosperity based on the search for the way to alleviate poverty through the economic system reform, agricultural cooperation and industrial modernization.</p>
<p>The time for wide mobilization had ripened by the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee of the CPC held in December 1978.</p>
<p>At that time, Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping, a prudent and far-sighted figure, thought that if some people's standard of living was raised first, this would inevitably be an impressive example to their neighbors. In Deng's opinion, this was the way to push the entire national economy to develop continuously. Inevitably, development under the new wave would improve the living standards of Chinese people and contribute to poverty alleviation. Deng pointed out that the nature of socialism is to release and develop the productive forces and ultimately achieve common prosperity.</p>
<p>The accomplished results were significant, but the battle against poverty had to be continued. Thus the Seven-Year Program for Lifting 80 Million People Out of Poverty (1994-2000) was promulgated to continuously and deeply promote poverty alleviation and development. Former president Jiang Zemin integrated poverty alleviation and development into national development strategies and profoundly addressed the specific issues such as the standards, contents and subjects of poverty alleviation.</p>
<p>In the following period, the CPC Central Committee led by Hu Jintao put forward higher requirements for poverty alleviation and development. Hu emphasized that poverty alleviation and development are a fundamental requirement of the Scientific Outlook on Development.</p>
<p>In the next decade, the direction was determined at the 18th National Congress of the CPC. Poverty alleviation and development as the core of the overall development strategy was set by President Xi Jinping. Again, the government put its efforts into achieving the extremely important strategic mission: building a moderate prosperous society in all respects.</p>
<p>This mission was integrated into the country's master plans including the Five-Sphere Integrated Plan and the Four-Pronged Comprehensive Strategy. The Five-Sphere Integrated Plan established a relationship of mutual support with overall socialist modernization, including the construction of economic, political, cultural, social and ecological systems; and the Four-Pronged Comprehensive Strategy included completing the building of a moderately prosperous society in all respects, deepening reform, advancing the rule of law, and exercising strict governance over the Party. Subsequently, the idea of eliminating poverty, improving people's livelihoods and achieving common prosperity became an essential part of the Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era.</p>
<p>Under the strong leadership of both the CPC Central Committee and the State Council, followed by active cooperation of local governments and participation of the whole society, the implementation of measures has borne fruit. China has made unprecedented achievements in rapid economic growth and poverty alleviation.</p>
<p>Even more, China has acquired the prestigious status of being the first developing country in the world to achieve the poverty alleviation goal set by the UN 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda. China has proved to be a leader in poverty alleviation on the global scale.</p>
