			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Marilyn:</td>

				<td class="roles">Marilyn:</td>
				<td>And I'm torn. I really want to go back to work, use my talents, and pursue my career in fashion design like we always thought I would. But now&#160;...&#160;I want to be with Max as a full-time mother, especially when he's a baby.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Richard:</td>
				<td>I really understand, Marilyn. But you never have to worry about Max. There's Mother and Grandpa&#160;...&#160;and I can always arrange my photo schedule around your schedule, if that will help.</td>

				<td class="roles">Marilyn:</td>

				<td class="roles">Richard:</td>

			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Marilyn:</td>

				<td class="roles">Richard:</td>
