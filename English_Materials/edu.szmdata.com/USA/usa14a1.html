				<td class="roles">Susan:</td>
				<td>Oh, I love it. It's so convenient. I can take the bus to work&#160;...&#160;or the subway&#160;...&#160;or a taxi. And there's so much to do. Lots of movie houses, and the theater.</td>

				<td class="roles">Harry:</td>
				<td>I know what you mean. I'd like to live in the city, but living in New Jersey and the suburbs is better for Michelle. Trees, grass.</td>

			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Susan:</td>
				<td>There's a lot of good things about suburban living. I grew up in Riverdale, remember? So I know. But, as a working woman, I think New York has all the conveniences&#151;including the best tomatoes. <span class="brac">[She gives a slice of tomato to Harry to taste.]</span></td>

				<td>You're right, Harry. Today is the perfect example. Michelle and her friends are at the aquarium in Brooklyn. They come back here for lunch, then go uptown to the Museum of Natural History. There's so much for young people to see and do. It's just incredible!</td>

				<td class="roles">Susan:</td>
				<td>Oh yes, Harry. My mother and father often took us somewhere in the city on the weekends. Dad was a busy doctor, but he usually managed to squeeze a Sunday in with Richard, Robbie, and me. I used to love to go to the Metropolitan Museum of Art.</td>
