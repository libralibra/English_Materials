				<td>The editorial in this paper made my friend Nat Baker very upset. Ah! I'll read it to you. &quot;The old library building on Chestnut Street, which has been vacant for over a year now, was supposed to be made into a community center to serve the senior citizens as well as the younger people of Riverdale. Due to lack of funds for the repainting of the interior of the building and for the furniture needed, the plans for the community center have been postponed indefinitely.&quot; He's coming over to talk about it.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Robbie:</td>
				<td>Is it that serious a problem, Grandpa?</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Grandpa:</td>
				<td>It is. Nat's not as lucky as I am, Robbie. He doesn't have any family with him, He lived alone and depends on places like a community center to be with people&#151;people his own age.</td>

				<td>But there's the old community center on Elm Street.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Grandpa:</td>
				<td>It's small, and the problem is that it's set up primarily for kids to play. Ping-pong tables, soda machines, and lots of music. It's too noisy for some older people like Nat.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Robbie:</td>
				<td>I never realized that.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Grandpa:</td>
				<td>It's hard for some older people to take all that noise. That's why the new community center is a good idea. Part of the building for older people, part of the building for younger people.</td>

				<td class="roles">Robbie:</td>
				<td>But you had to be good at math. You graduated from engineering school.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Grandpa:</td>
				<td>I was. But not in high school. For some reason, I couldn't get a handle on it. Then, in college, I became good at it.</td>
			</tr>

				<td>Then there's hope for Robbie.</td>
