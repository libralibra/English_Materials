			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Richard:</td>
				<td>No.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Riley:</td>
				<td>I see. Then you don't have any collateral. Perhaps you could get a guarantor&#151;someone to sign for the loan for you.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Richard:</td>
				<td>Why is that necessary?</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Riley:</td>
				<td>Since you don't have enough income, and you don't already own any property, the bank needs to be sure you can pay the mortgage every month. A guarantor is responsible for the loan if you can't make the payments.</td>

				<td class="roles">Richard:</td>

			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Marilyn:</td>
				<td>We have no collateral.</td>

			</tr>
			<tr>
