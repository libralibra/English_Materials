			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Robbie:</td>

			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Ellen:</td>
				<td>It's a real problem, Robbie. I know it.</td>

				<td class="roles">Ellen:</td>
				<td>It would be wonderful, but our schedules won't allow it.</td>

			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Robbie:</td>

				<td class="roles">Ellen:</td>

			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Ellen:</td>
				<td>I don't get it.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Robbie:</td>
				<td>Like setting up a regular weekly reading program. You and Dad. You and Dr. Philip Stewart&#151;going to the children's ward once or twice a week and <i>reading</i> to them.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Ellen:</td>
				<td>Not bad. Not a bad idea, Robbie. As a matter of fact, it fits right in with something I'm working on right now with the school-board committee.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Robbie:</td>
				<td>What's that?</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Ellen:</td>
				<td>I've been trying to work out a program in the public school that will bring parents and teachers together once a week to read to the students&#151;their own children, really. By doing that, it will encourage reading.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Robbie:</td>
				<td>So it might fit in with a program for reading to the kids in the hospital.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Ellen:</td>
				<td>You're right. We'll do it! I'm going to talk to Daddy about it right now.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Robbie:</td>
				<td>But Dad was so exhausted when he came home from work. Why don't you talk to him about it tomorrow?</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Ellen:</td>
				<td>You are a very smart young man, Robbie. I think I'll wait until tomorrow.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Robbie:</td>
				<td>You won't forget, will you?</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Ellen:</td>
				<td>Believe me, I won't. It is a great idea, and I promise you I won't forget.</td>
