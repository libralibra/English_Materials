				<td class="roles">Virginia:</td>
				<td>I remember your parents' first house very well. It was on Spring Avenue, near the park.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Richard:</td>
				<td>I grew up in that house.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Virginia:</td>
				<td>Yes, and you were such a cute baby.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Marilyn:</td>
				<td>I've seen pictures of him. He had blond hair.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Virginia:</td>
				<td>I've been friendly with the Stewart family for a long time, so it's my pleasure to help you find a house now.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Richard:</td>
				<td>Well, we're not sure we can afford one.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Marilyn:</td>
				<td>But we'd like to find out about the possibilities.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Virginia:</td>
				<td>That's a good idea. I love your house on Linden Street. I sold your father that house seventeen years ago.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Marilyn:</td>
				<td>Really?</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Richard:</td>
				<td>Yes, Mom was pregnant with Robbie then, and they needed the extra room.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Virginia:</td>
				<td>I hear <i>you're</i> expecting a baby, Mrs. Stewart.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Marilyn:</td>

			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Virginia:</td>
				<td>Oh, so you don't need something immediately?</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Richard:</td>
				<td>No. But in five or six months&#160;...&#160;</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Marilyn:</td>
				<td>And time passes so quickly.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Virginia:</td>
				<td>Yes, it does. Well, when you called, you gave enough information about your salaries and your savings. So I have a good idea about your financial situation. Let me show you some pictures of houses.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Marilyn:</td>
				<td>With two bedrooms?</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Virginia:</td>
				<td>Yes, I think I can show you some. Of course, they won't be in Riverdale. The cost of housing's too high for you here.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Richard:</td>
				<td>I haven't thought about living anywhere else. We've always lived in this area.</td>

				<td class="roles">Marilyn:</td>
				<td>Where <i>should</i> we look for a house, Mrs. Martinelli?</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Virginia:</td>
				<td>Well, we have an office in Mount Kisco. It's a lovely area, and it's only about an hour's drive from here. <span class="brac">[She takes out a book of photos.]</span> Here. I have a book with photos of some homes in that area. Now, let's see. Here. This is a lovely two-bedroom house in your price range.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Marilyn:</td>
				<td>It's pretty, but I prefer a two-story home.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Richard:</td>
				<td>I do, too. I don't care for a ranch type.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Virginia:</td>
				<td>OK. <span class="brac">[She turns the pages of the real-estate book.]</span> Oh, this is a wonderful house. I know it well. I sold it to the present owners.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Richard:</td>
				<td>It <i>looks</i> wonderful.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Virginia:</td>
				<td>This is a two-bedroom, two-bath house. It has a full basement, and it is on a half-acre lot. You can probably afford this one.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Marilyn:</td>
				<td>I like this house.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Richard:</td>
				<td>So do I.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Virginia:</td>
				<td>And the price is right. Would you like to go see it?</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Richard:</td>
				<td>Yes. We're planning to talk to someone at the bank next week. Perhaps we could see the house this weekend.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Virginia:</td>
				<td>If someone doesn't buy it before then. But let's keep looking. Just to get an idea of some other possibilities.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Richard:</td>
				<td>This is very helpful, Mrs. Martinelli.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Virginia:</td>
				<td>Here. This is a wonderful example of Spanish-style architecture.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Richard:</td>
				<td>Oh, I love the roof tiles on a Spanish-style house.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Marilyn:</td>
				<td>It looks like the houses in Hollywood.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Virginia:</td>
				<td>It's interesting. A house like this in Riverdale costs double the price. <span class="brac">[She turns the pages of the book.]</span> Oh my! Here's a real buy. It's a bargain. This house just came on the market.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Marilyn:</td>
				<td>It's quite lovely. Is it a two-bedroom house?</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Virginia:</td>
				<td>No. It has three bedrooms and three baths. I know the house. It has a brand-new kitchen. And a living room with a twelve-foot ceiling. And there's a two-car garage.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Richard:</td>
				<td>Then why don't we go look at this house, too?</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Virginia:</td>
				<td>It's a good investment.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Richard:</td>
				<td>Thank you, Mrs. Martinelli.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Marilyn:</td>
				<td>Thanks so much.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Virginia:</td>
				<td>My pleasure. Give my best to your parents. <span class="brac">[Richard and Marilyn get up to leave.]</span></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Virginia:</td>
				<td>Your father's a wonderful doctor, Richard. He took care of my daughter when she was a child. He's the best pediatrician in Westchester.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Richard:</td>
				<td>Thanks, Mrs. Martinelli, I'll give them your regards.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Marilyn:</td>

			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Virginia:</td>
				<td>I do think you should go see the houses and talk to the bank. Here. Let me give you some information sheets about the houses. They're both very good buys.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Richard:</td>
				<td>Well, thanks so much for your help and your time, Mrs. Martinelli. <span class="brac">[to Marilyn]</span> We've got a lot to talk about.</td>
			</tr>

				<td class="roles">Marilyn:</td>
				<td>Mmm-hmm. Thanks.</td>
