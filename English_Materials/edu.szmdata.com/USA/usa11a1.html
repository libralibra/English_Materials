				<td colspan="2" class="exp">In the living room of the Stewarts' home in Riverdale. Marilyn is designing a dress. She stops for a while to talk to her mother-in-law.</td>

				<td class="roles">Marilyn:</td>
				<td>Ellen, I'd like your opinion.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Ellen:</td>
				<td>About what?</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Marilyn:</td>
				<td>Well, Richard and I feel that with a baby coming we need to have our own place to live.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Ellen:</td>
				<td>Oh.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Marilyn:</td>
				<td>Well, what do you think about Richard and me looking for a small house or an apartment at this point in our lives?</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Ellen:</td>
				<td>We love having you here, and there <i>is</i> room and&#160;...&#160;and when the baby comes, the baby can stay in your room for a while.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Marilyn:</td>
				<td>Richard feels we need to find a small house.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Ellen:</td>
				<td>I remember when I was pregnant with Richard. Philip and I were living with Grandma and Grandpa. Philip was a young doctor, and he kept talking about having a house of our own. It's natural.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Marilyn:</td>
				<td>What did you do?</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Ellen:</td>
				<td>We looked at a lot of houses.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Marilyn:</td>
				<td>Did you find one?</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Ellen:</td>
				<td>Oh, not at first. We couldn't afford it. Grandpa wanted to lend us the money to buy one, but Philip is too independent. He didn't want to borrow any money.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Marilyn:</td>
				<td>Sounds like Richard.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Ellen:</td>
				<td>They're all alike. Richard is a real Stewart. He's independent, and sometimes just stubborn.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Marilyn:</td>
				<td>When <i>did</i> you buy a house?</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Ellen:</td>
				<td>After Richard was born. I was teaching music, and Philip was opening his first medical office.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Marilyn:</td>
				<td>Where was the house?</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Ellen:</td>
				<td>Right here in Riverdale. Of course, it was a small house, but just right for us.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Marilyn:</td>
				<td>It's funny. History repeats itself. Now Richard and I are having a baby, and we probably won't be able to afford a house right away, either.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Ellen:</td>
				<td>Why don't you look at some houses, Marilyn?</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Marilyn:</td>
				<td>Good idea.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Ellen:</td>
				<td>Look in the real-estate section of Sunday's <i>Times</i>. You'll learn a lot.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Marilyn:</td>
				<td>Maybe we should speak to a real-estate agent about a house.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Ellen:</td>
				<td>And a bank about a mortgage.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Marilyn:</td>
				<td>I'll talk to Richard about it. I think it's a good idea, Ellen. We <i>can </i> learn a lot by asking.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Ellen:</td>
				<td>And if I can be of any help, let me know. As a matter of fact, my friend Virginia Martinelli is a real-estate agent.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Marilyn:</td>
				<td>Good.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Ellen:</td>
				<td>You won't believe this, but she sold us our first house and this one.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Marilyn:</td>
				<td>Well, I'll tell Richard, and we'll go to see <i>her</i>. <span class="brac">[She looks at the dress she is designing.]</span> Do you think the skirt length is right, Ellen? Do you think it's too long?</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Ellen:</td>
				<td>I think the skirt is just right. Are you planning to attach a train to it?</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Marilyn:</td>
				<td>No. No train. Just the dress. But I <i>am</i> going to make a headpiece of lace.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Ellen:</td>
				<td>That dress is gorgeous.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Marilyn:</td>
				<td>Thanks, Ellen. And thanks for the advice about the house. I'll talk to Richard about it the minute he comes home.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Ellen:</td>
				<td>And remember, we love having you here. There's no need to rush. <span class="brac">[They hug.]</span></td>
