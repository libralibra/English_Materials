We need a new coffee-table book, and a book of photos about the United States still feels right. OK, let's take a look. <span class="brac">[Richard gives him the album, and Mr. Carlson looks at the photographs.]</span> Good. Very good. <i>Family Album, U.S.A.</i> It's an excellent title. If you had to describe the book in one sentence, how would you do it?</td>

				<td class="roles">Carlson:</td>
				<td>In the section on culture, you've included performing arts centers, but you've left out street performance. The mimes. The musicians. The dancers&#151;in the parks and on the streets. Richard, if you go out and photograph street performances in the city, you'll have it.</td>

				<td class="roles">Richard:</td>
