				<td class="roles">Grandpa:</td>

				<td class="roles">Grandpa:</td>
				<td>Oh, it must be a bill.</td>

			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Robbie:</td>

			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Robbie:</td>
				<td>How come he never got married?</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Grandpa:</td>
				<td>That's a good question, Robbie. A very good question. He never married because the girl he was in love with in college married someone else. As simple as that. He never got over it.</td>

				<td class="roles">Robbie:</td>

			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Grandpa:</td>

			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Robbie:</td>

			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Grandpa:</td>
