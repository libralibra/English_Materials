				<td>Pete Waters' farm, near Chesterton.</td>

				<td class="roles">Attendant:</td>
				<td>Sure. You take the next left turn. You'll see a stop sign. Make a right at the stop sign. Stay on that road, and you'll cross a blue bridge. Then you'll see a big old red barn. That's the back of Pete Waters' place.</td>

				<td class="roles">Grandpa:</td>
				<td>OK. Let me repeat it. I take the next left turn to the stop sign. Then a right across a blue bridge, and then a big red barn.</td>
