When I get back, we'll talk about my new factory. My company is a member of TOPS. So I try hard to find opportunities for people like you, Malcolm. And when I see an opportunity, I can act on it. Well, I can use your brainpower on the job right now. Have you got time this morning to go over to the construction site with me? I'd like to have you meet my foreman&#151;get some background on the job.</td>

But a simple solution might be to move the air-conditioning units instead of redesigning the entire system. It might be simpler and less expensive.</td>
