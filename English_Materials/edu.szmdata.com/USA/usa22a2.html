				<td class="exp" colspan="2">Saturday morning. Marilyn and her mother-in-law Ellen are on the patio with Max.</td>

				<td> <span class="brac">[She puts Max's teddy bear in his playpen.]</span> There's your teddy bear, Max.</td>

				<td>He just loves that teddy bear that Grandpa Philip bought for him.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Marilyn:</td>
				<td>I took him to Philip's office yesterday for a check-up. You should have seen the look on his face when Molly gave him the injection.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Ellen:</td>
				<td>Oh, did he cry?</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Marilyn:</td>
				<td>No. My dear little boy just looked up at me as if to say, &quot;Mama, what are they doing to me? Help!&quot;</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Ellen:</td>
				<td>How did you feel? Tell the truth. Didn't you feel terrible?</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Marilyn:</td>
				<td>I sure did. I held him closely. I kissed the top of his dear little head. He looked up at me. He tried to smile. Being with him helped.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Ellen:</td>
				<td>Helped him? Or helped you?</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Marilyn:</td>
				<td>Being a mother is not easy, if that's what you mean.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Ellen:</td>
				<td>Speaking of being a mother, I've been meaning to ask you what you were thinking about regarding going back to work. I know Rita Mae called. I can imagine what is going through your head.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Marilyn:</td>
				<td>I'm sure you can, Ellen.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Ellen:</td>
				<td>There are so many things to consider. One thing that makes it easier for you is that you have us. Max will always have a family member to watch over him while you're at work. I didn't have that when Richard and Susan were born.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Marilyn:</td>
				<td>What did you do?</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Ellen:</td>
				<td>I chose to continue with my career as a music teacher. We hired a woman to watch Richard and the Susan, and I continued with my career.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Marilyn:</td>
				<td>Do you think you made the right decision?</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Ellen:</td>
				<td>I think I did. But when Robbie was born, I decided to give full-time attention to raising Robbie. I felt differently at that time.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Marilyn:</td>
				<td>And you gave up your career as a music teacher?</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Ellen:</td>
				<td>Not exactly. I continued to teach piano lessons at home.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Marilyn:</td>
				<td>How did you feel about being away when Susan and Richard were babies?</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Ellen:</td>
				<td>I think I did the right thing for them and for myself and for Philip. We needed the money. Remember?</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Marilyn:</td>
				<td>Well, we do too, Ellen. Everything I earn helps us towards getting that house we want and need.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="exp" colspan="2">Saturday afternoon. Susan joins Ellen, Marilyn, and Max on the patio.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Susan:</td>
				<td>I can't wait till he's just a little older. Our toy company makes the most wonderful toys for kids.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Marilyn:</td>
				<td>Max thanks you. I thank you. And Richard thanks you. Now may I please say hello?</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Susan:</td>

			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Ellen:</td>
				<td>Will you please try to relax? I've never seen you so wound up.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Marilyn:</td>
				<td>You seem to be enjoying the pressure.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Susan:</td>
				<td>The truth is, I am. My job is not an easy one, but I really enjoy it.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Marilyn:</td>
				<td>That is exactly what I wanted to talk to you about, Susan.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Susan:</td>
				<td>What's the problem?</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Ellen:</td>
				<td>Marilyn's career.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Marilyn:</td>
				<td>Well, my choice of careers.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Susan:</td>
				<td>Choice?</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Marilyn:</td>
				<td>My career as a fashion designer versus my career as a mother.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Susan:</td>
				<td>Why does it have to be one or the other?</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Ellen:</td>
				<td>That's what I said.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Marilyn:</td>
				<td>How's that?</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Susan:</td>
				<td>Why can't you do both?</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Ellen:</td>
				<td>She's right.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Marilyn:</td>
				<td>Both?</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Susan:</td>
				<td>Well, that's what I do. I have a job, and I have Michelle. I take care of both to the best of my ability. It's not easy, but what is?</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Ellen:</td>
				<td>And that's what <i>I</i> did. I did both with Richard and Susan, and I did both with Robbie.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Marilyn:</td>
				<td>I thought you stayed home with Robbie?</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Ellen:</td>
				<td>I did. But I was lucky enough to have a career as a music teacher which I could continue at home.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Susan:</td>
				<td>Why can't <i>you</i> work at home, Marilyn? You are very talented. Designing dresses is a career you could establish out of you home, couldn't you?</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Marilyn:</td>
				<td>I don't know why I didn't think of it. It seems so simple now. For a year or two I could stay at home with Max and do my dress designs.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Ellen:</td>
				<td>And you could make your dresses at home.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Susan:</td>
				<td>Sounds like a great way to solve the problem.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Ellen:</td>
				<td>That could solve your problem, Marilyn.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Marilyn:</td>
				<td>I'm going to call Rita Mae at home and ask her to come by and talk about it. She wants to see Max, anyway.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Susan:</td>
				<td>I think that really answers your questions, Marilyn. You can do it. Do your designs at home&#151;here?</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Marilyn:</td>
				<td>And let Rita Mae do the selling at the boutique.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Ellen:</td>
				<td>And you can both benefit financially.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Marilyn:</td>
				<td>I'm going to call Rita Mae right now. Oh, Susan, thank you so much for coming all this way from the city to talk to me about it. I hope you don't mind having taken so much time away from your busy schedule.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Susan:</td>
				<td>Are you kidding? I don't mind at all. As a matter of fact, I came to spend some time with my favorite nephew. <span class="brac">[She bends over the playpen.]</span></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Ellen:</td>
				<td>I think you should call Rita Mae right now. I think your idea of working at home is perfect.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Marilyn:</td>
				<td>I don't know what I would do without you. I'm lucky to have you all.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Ellen:</td>
				<td>We are lucky to have <i>you</i>, Marilyn.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="roles">Susan:</td>
				<td>And so is Max.</td>
