				<td class="roles">Richard:</td>
				<td>The problem is that I'm a photographer, not an editor. I like what I do. In fact, I love what I do&#160;...&#160;which is going out with a camera and a roll of film and seeing the wonder of humanity. Now, I appreciate your offer, but I've worked so hard on <i>Family Album, U.S.A.</i>, and I'm giving some thought to a new book on a different subject. I'm flattered, but I enjoy taking pictures, and I want to continue doing that. Thank you, but I'm happy being a photographer.</td>
