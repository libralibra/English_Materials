<p>With a changing world, adventure stories change too, but Treasure Island is one which will always be read wherever there are children to be fascinated by the idea of buried treasure and the tussle between good and evil. It is one of the greatest adventure stories every written.</p>

<p class="storyTitle">Treasure Island </p>
<p class="r"><i>by</i> Robert Louis Stevenson </p>

<p>I remember, as if it were yesterday, the old seaman who came to live at our inn. He was tall and strong and his black pigtail hung on his shoulders. His hands were rough and he had a white scar across one cheek. His name was Billy Bones and when he was drunk, as he often was, we were all afraid of him. He never talked to any of the sailors who called at the inn, and he paid me fourpence a month to warn him if I should ever see a sailor with one leg.</p>
<p>My father was ill at the time and I was left to look after Billy Bones. He drank so much that Dr Livesey warned him that rum would kill him. But he didn't care to change his ways and, when he lay weak and helpless in his bed, he told me a bit about himself.</p>
<p>He had been the mate on board the pirate ship of Captain Flint. When the captain was dying he had given Billy Bones the map that showed where his treasure was buried. Since that day the rest of Flint's old crew had tried to get hold of the map. It was hidden in Billy Bones' sea-chest.</p>
<p>One frosty afternoon an old blind seaman, Blind Pew, called at the inn. He gripped Billy Bones' hand as he left and something passed from his hand to Billy's. I saw the fear in Billy's eyes when he looked into his hand.</p>
<p>"The black spot!" he cried. "Jim Hawkins, listen to me. This black spot means that my old shipmates are coming to get me. They're after my map, Jim! They'll kill me!" He sprang up as he spoke and the strain and shock must have been too much. He fell dead at my feet.</p>
<p>Billy Bones died without paying his bills. My mother and I took from his sea-chest some of his money to pay what he owed. There was also a bundle of papers which I took for safe keeping.</p>
<p>That very night a gang of ruffians attacked our inn. My mother and I hid outside and watched as they searched Billy Bones' sea-chest. Unable to find what they wanted, they shouted and raged. I realised that the bundle of papers in my packet was what they were after.</p>
<p>I went to Dr Livesey and Squire Trelawney and told them the whole story. When we opened the bundle we found Captain Flint's treasure map, and the Squire was very excited. "Flint was the most bloodthirsty pirate that ever sailed," he cried. "I'll fit out a ship in Bristol! "I'll take you, doctor, and you too, Jim Hawkins, and some of my men. We'll have that treasure!" So it was that Squire Trelawney bought the <i>Hispaniola</i> and prepared her for the voyage. He needed a good crew, and took on a one-legged sailor named Long John Silver as ship's cook. This man was very helpful to the Squire and picked out some tough men to work the ship. In a few weeks the <i>Hispaniola</i> was ready to sail away.</p>
<p>We set sail under our captain, Captain Smollett. I was ship's boy. The coxswain, Israel Hands, was an able man, and Long John Silver was a fine cook. He carried his crutch on a cord round his neck so that both his hands were free. He propped himself against the side and got on with his cooking like someone safe ashore. We all worked well and willingly, and I often heard the crew singing as they worked. The song was one I'd heard from old Billy Bones.</p>
<p>"Fifteen men on the Dead Man's Chest&#151;Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum!"</p>
<p>I passed many spare moments in Silver's shining galley where his parrot, Captain Flint, swung in its cage. It was named after the pirate and all day long it screeched, "Pieces of eight! Pieces of eight! Pieces of eight!" Silver was interesting company, full of gripping yarns of other voyages and adventures. He was well-liked by all and the men looked on him as a leader.</p>
<p>On deck we kept a barrel of apples for the men to help themselves. One evening I went to the barrel and, finding it nearly empty, climbed inside to get an apple from the bottom. There I sat, quietly rocked by the sea. Someone sat down on the deck and leaned against the barrel and started to speak. The words I overheard made my blood run cold. Israel Hands and Silver were planning to take over the ship once we had found the treasure. They would kill the captain and any of us who would not fall in with them! I could not believe my ears.</p>
<p>There was a sudden shout of "Land-ho!" The men all ran to catch a first sight of land. I took the chance to jump out of the barrel and join the rest. Captain Smollett was telling the crew about the island. Long John Silver said that he'd been there before when his ship had put in for water. I looked at his smiling face and shuddered. I now knew that Silver was more than a cheerful ship's cook. He was also a bloodthirsty pirate! As soon as I could slip away I told the captain and my friends, the Squire and the doctor, what I had heard. They decided we were safe until the treasure was found. There were nineteen pirates, but only seven of us. When we were ready we would surprise them, and hope to win by catching them unprepared.</p>
<p>We now lay off Treasure Island. It looked a gloomy, forbidding place. The lower parts were wooded, with rocky peaks jutting above the trees. Even in the sunshine, with birds soaring above, I hated the thought of it. We were anchored in an inlet where trees came down to the water. The air was hot and still, and the men were restless and grumbling. Captain Smollett gave leave for the men to go ashore, which raised their spirits. I believe the silly fellows thought they would break their shins over treasure as soon as they landed. Long John Silver was in charge of the two boats taking thirteen men ashore. I knew I should not be needed on board and decided to go ashore too.</p>
<p>I ran up the beach into the woods, glad to be free and alone. I sat quietly hidden in the bushes. Hearing voices, I moved nearer to catch the words. I could see and hear Silver bullying a sailor to join the pirates. The sailor angrily refused. Silver's answer was to plunge his dagger into the man and leave him lying dead in the forest. I felt faint, and the whole world swam from me in a whirling mist. When I pulled myself together, Silver, crutch under his arm, was wiping his knife on a tuft of grass. I feared for my life if I should be found, and ran and ran, not caring where.</p>
<p>When I stopped I was at the foot of a stony hill. My eye was caught by a movement on the hillside. I could not tell if it was a man or an animal. Here was a new danger I felt I could not face, and I began to run towards the shore. But the creature was faster than me and, darting from tree to tree, he came closer. I could see now that it was a man, but so wild and strange that I was afraid. As he neared me he threw himself on the ground, and held up his hands as if begging for mercy.</p>
<p>My courage returned and I spoke to him. "Who are you?" I asked.</p>
<p>"I'm poor Ben Gunn, I am," he answered. "It's three years since I spoke to anyone." I had never seen such a ragged creature. He was dressed in a patchwork of odd clothes and goatskins, and his blue eyes looked startling in a face burned black by the sun.</p>
<p>He told me he was rich, and babbled away in a high, squeaking voice. Sometimes he spoke sense and sometimes his words had no meaning. I felt he might be a little crazy after being alone so long. He said that he'd been on Captain Flint's pirate ship and that three years before he had come back with some seamen to look for Flint's treasure. When they could not find it the sailors went off, leaving him alone on the island. When he's seen our ship he'd thought that Flint had returned.</p>
<p>I told him Flint was dead, but that some of Flint's old shipmates were among our crew. When I spoke of Silver, his face filled with terror. I told him we should have to fight the pirates, and he promised to help us if we would take him back home with us.</p>

<p>Our talk was interrupted by gunfire, and we ran towards the sound. Among the trees we came upon a high wooden fence which ran round a cleared space in the forest. I could see the Union Jack flying from a strong log-house in the clearing. I knew that my friends must have left the ship and were defending themselves in the log-house. The battle with the pirates had begun! The <i>Hispaniola</i> lay in the inlet with the Jolly Roger at her mast. On the beach a group of drunken sailors lolled on the sand.</p>
<p>I parted from Ben Gunn and climbed the stockade to join my friends in the log-house. They wee delighted to see me, for they had feared for my safety. Dr Livesey told me what had happened after I had left the ship. The captain had decided that the time had come to fight it out with the pirates. From Flint's treasure chart he knew about the log-house. Dr Livesey and one of our men had rowed ashore to find it. There was a fresh water spring by the house and the high fence made it a good place to defend. They then returned to the <i>Hispaniola</i> to collect the rest of the faithful crew. They had loaded a small boat with food and ammunition and made a dash for the shore.</p>
<p>There was a small group of pirates still on board the ship. When they saw what was happening they had opened fire on the little boat and it had sunk in shallow water. The Squire's party had waded ashore but lost half the stores and gunpowder. The doctor was sure the pirates would soon give up the fight. He said they would get ill from too much rum and with disease from their swampy camp-site.</p>
<p>I told my friends what had happened to me, and of my meeting with Ben Gunn. Dr Livesey wanted to know all about him, for we clearly needed help. The three leaders of our party were at their wits' end what to do. We had little food and the pirates could soon starve us out. I was worn out at the end of a hard day and soon fell asleep.</p>
<p>In the morning I awakened to the sound of bustling and voices. Long John Silver himself was approaching the stockade carrying a white flag. Captain Smollett suspected a trick and ordered us to be ready to fire. Silver said he had come to make terms to end the fighting. He was allowed to come inside the stockade. He threw his crutch over, got a leg up and cleverly dropped inside the clearing. He came and sat down outside the log-house, and told the captain that the pirates intended to get the treasure. He said that, in exchange for the treasure map, he would take us off the island to some safe place.</p>
<p>Captain Smollett was not the man to make terms with pirates. Angrily, he told Silver that he and the pirates were done for. Without the map they had no hope of finding the treasure. With or without the treasure, not one of them could plot a course to sail the ship home. He ordered Silver out of his sight. Fury blazed in Silver's eyes, and, with curses and threats, he disappeared into the wood.</p>
<p>We now prepared for the coming attack, and sat and waited in the baking heat. Suddenly, musket shots hit the log-house, and pirates leapt from the woods and climbed the stockade. Shouts and groans, shots and flashes filled the air. I grabbed a cutlass and dashed outside to join in the fight. In moments we had fought them back. Those who were not killed or injured scampered to the woods for shelter. We ran back to the log-house to take stock. We knew there must be a second attack. We had lost two men and the captain was badly injured. We waited and watched, but all remained quiet.</p>
<p>In the lull, I saw Dr Livesey slip quietly out of the stockade. I guessed he was going to find Ben Gunn. Still no attack came and I grew weary of waiting. The heat, the blood and the dust made me restless and I longed to get away to a cool, fresh place. I knew the captain would never let me leave the stockade. When no one was looking I put two pistols in my pocket and slipped out.</p>
<p>I ran to the shore and felt the cool wind and watched the surf tumbling and tossing its foam along the beach. Climbing a hill, I could look down on the calm inlet where the <i>Hispaniola</i> lay on a flat sea. In a little boat beside her I could make out Long John Silver. He was talking and laughing with two men on the ship. No words reached me, but the screeching of Silver's parrot was carried on the wind. About sundown, Silver shoved off for the shore and the two men left on board went below deck. I was sure that if the pirates could not find the treasure they would sail away without us. A plan began to grow in my mind.</p>
<p>Ben Gunn had told me that he had made a boat and hidden it near the shore. If I could get to the <i>Hispaniola</i> I could cut her anchor ropes. She would drift away to another part of the shore and the pirates would be unable to escape from the island. I searched in the bushes and, to my joy, found the hidden boat. It was made of goatskin stretched over a wooden frame, and it was so flimsy I wondered if it was strong enough or big enough to hold me. With darkness, fog crept into the inlet. It was a perfect night for my plan. I pushed away from the shore and drifted silently towards the <i>Hispaniola</i>.</p>
<p>As I came alongside the ship I could hear loud, drunken voices. Israel Hands was shouting at another man. They were not only tipsy, it was plain they were also angry. On the shore I could see the glow of the fire in the pirates' camp. Someone there was singing the song I'd heard so often before&#151;</p>
<p>"Fifteen men on the Dead Man's Chest&#151;</p>
<p>Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum!</p>
<p>Drink and the devil had done for the rest&#151;</p>
<p>Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum!"</p>
<p>Strand by strand, I cut the anchor rope and the ship began to swing and slide away to the open sea. As she slid past me I could see into the cabin. Israel Hands and the ship's watchman were fighting. They were too busy to feel the movement of the ship. I was in great danger and I lay flat in my little boat, praying I should not be seen.</p>
